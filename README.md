## Brief
Brief about the project

## Task List
- [X]  Research and Development
- [X]  Initial Work
- [X]  Source Dataset

- [ ]  Create Website (Ongoing)
- [ ]  Implementing Core Features (Ongoing) 
- [ ]  Additional Features


## Aim

- To make a tool that identifies the health status of a participant
- To provide stratification of a person’s health status.
- To allow a local multidisciplinary approach to identify those who are seriously ill, or at immediate risk of a hospital admission
- To provide a platform for professionals to coordinate the care of the participant
- To provide remote active care management and diagnosis

---

## Use

- At least a quarterly risk profiling of the participant to identify those who are predicted to become or at significant risk of emergency hospital admission.
- Actively and passively measure the participants’ health status via various factors such as weight, hydration, activity stress, etc...
- Keep a holistic record of the participant's health records, previous conditions, known hereditary conditions, etc...
- Keep a record of the participants’ current trends such as activity or recovery.
- Shared and Integrated approach to care management to improve quality of care and reduce individual risk of emergency hospital admission

---

## Role

In prevention and health promotion interventions, screening methods, and risk profile assessments, are often used as methods for establishing the interventions’ effectiveness, for the selection and determination of the health status of participants.
This tool is meant to do the same in a way such that it is accessible to all via a gamified approach

---

## Expected Result

Improved quality of care and life and fewer avoidable emergency admissions to hospital

---

## Effects

Screening methods and health risk assessments create effects as they objectify health risks and/or the health status of individuals, i.e. they select the individuals' ‘at risk’ and indicate the lifestyle modifications these people are required to make to improve their health

---

## Pitfalls

Reduce the group of participants thereby decreasing the possible effect of interventions, as they provide legitimizations for people to make choices, whether they enroll or not, and what changes they incorporate into their lives. i.e. They provide a space of interaction, in which agency is distributed to a professional, the participants, and the test (Risk profiling and screening).

---

## Result

Decisions are not made just upon the projection of the outcome of these instruments, they were made by both the participants and the professionals and were based on their opinions on these outcomes.

---

## Conclusion

Advancements in scientific research have yielded a deeper understanding of health determinants, behaviors, risk factors, and their prevalence across different populations. While this has empowered individuals with greater access to health knowledge, it has also created a situation where some may struggle to discern reliable information, particularly regarding urgent medical situations. This highlights the need for trustworthy resources that can alleviate confusion and provide accurate guidance.

The proposed work directly addresses this challenge by offering a tool that serves two key purposes. First, it acts as a reliable source of health information, mitigating the confusion caused by the abundance of online resources. Second, the tool facilitates the identification of health risks, enabling a more efficient and targeted allocation of resources within the healthcare system.
