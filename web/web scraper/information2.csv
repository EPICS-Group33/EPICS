About abdominal aortic aneurysms
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.
The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large AAA.
Large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.
The bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.
AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.
This is why all men are invited for a
screening test
when they turn 65. The test involves a simple
ultrasound scan
, which takes around 10-15 minutes.
Symptoms of an AAA
In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain.
An AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).
A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.
The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.
If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.

Causes of an AAA
It’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.
There are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level.
Having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.
Read more about the
causes of an AAA
.
Diagnosing an AAA
Because AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination – for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen.
The screening test is an
ultrasound scan
, which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.
Read more about
diagnosing an AAA
.
Treating an AAA
If a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent it rupturing.
This is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing.
If surgery is not advisable – or if you decide not to have it – there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing.
They include medications to lower your cholesterol and
blood pressure
, and
quitting smoking
.
You will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.

Prevention
The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm – or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing – is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as:
smoking
eating a high-fat diet
not exercising regularly
being overweight or obese

Symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm
In most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large.
Symptoms of an unruptured AAA may include:
a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that’s usually only noticeable when you touch it
persistent back pain
persistent abdominal pain
If you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your GP as soon as possible.
Ruptured AAA
If your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. In men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum.
Other symptoms include:
dizziness
sweaty and clammy skin
rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
shortness of breath
feeling faint
loss of consciousness
Medical emergency
A ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it’s important to get to hospital as soon as possible.
Around 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don’t survive emergency surgery.
This is why the
NHS AAA Screening Programme
was introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst.
If you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.
Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm.
The abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide – about the width of a garden hosepipe  – but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.
Risk factors for an AAA
It’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.
One study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than people under 55 years old.
Men are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than women.
However, there are other risk factors that you can do something about – described below – the most important of which is smoking.
Smoking
Research has found that smokers are seven times more likely to develop an AAA than people who have never smoked.
The more you smoke, the greater your risk of developing an AAA. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.
The risk may increase because tobacco smoke contains harmful substances that can damage and weaken the wall of the aorta.
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, such as cholesterol.
An AAA is thought to develop because these deposits (called plaques) cause the aorta to widen in an attempt to keep blood flowing through it. As it widens, it also gets weaker.
Smoking, eating a high-fat diet and high blood pressure all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis.
High blood pressure
As well as contributing to atherosclerosis,
high blood pressure (hypertension)
can place increased pressure on the aorta’s wall.
Family history
Having a family history of AAAs means that you have an increased risk of developing one.
One study found that people who had a brother or sister with an AAA were eight times more likely to develop one than people whose siblings were unaffected.
This suggests that certain genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing an AAA.
However, no specific genes have yet been identified.

reduce your risk of developing an AAA
.
Diagnosing an abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) usually causes no symptoms. Therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a GP notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen.
A diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. Ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.
Screening
All men in the UK who are 65 or over are offered an
ultrasound scan
to check for AAAs.
All men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. Men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting their
local NHS AAA screening service
.

Treating an abdominal aortic aneurysm
Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm’s size, your age and general health.
In general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.
This is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired.
If you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.
You will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing – for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.
If you have a large AAA
If you are diagnosed with an AAA that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation.
The surgeon will discuss treatment options with you, taking into account your general health and fitness, as well as the size of your aneurysm.
If it’s decided that surgery isn’t suitable for you, it’s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size – in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated.
See below for more information on treating small and medium aneurysms.
There are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm:
endovascular surgery
open surgery
Although both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
The surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable.
Endovascular surgery
Endovascular surgery is a type of “keyhole” surgery where the surgeon makes small cuts in your groin.
A small piece of tubing called a graft– made of metal mesh lined with fabric – is then guided up through the leg artery, into the swollen section of aorta, and sealed to the wall of the aorta at both ends.
This reinforces the aorta, reducing the risk of it bursting.
This is the safest of the two types of surgery available. Around 98-99% of patients make a full recovery, and recovery time from the operation is shorter than if you have open surgery.
There are also fewer major complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
However, the way the graft is attached is not as secure as open surgery. You’ll need regular scans to make sure the graft hasn’t slipped, and in some patients, the seal at each end of the graft starts to leak and will need to be resealed. You will need to have surgery again if either of these occurs.
Open surgery
In open surgery, the surgeon cuts into your stomach (abdomen) to reach the abdominal aorta and replaces the enlarged section with a graft.
This type of graft is a tube made of a synthetic material.
Because the graft is stitched (sutured) into place by the surgeon, it’s more likely to stay in place, and will usually work well for the rest of your life.
The risk of complications linked to the graft after surgery is lower than in people who have endovascular surgery.
Open surgery isn’t usually recommended for people who are in poor health as it is a major operation. It is slightly more risky than endovascular surgery, with 93-97% of patients making a full recovery.
The main risk of open surgery is death or heart attack, and recovery time is longer than with endovascular surgery.
There is also a greater risk of complications, such as wound infection, chest infection and DVT.
If you have a small or medium AAA
If you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won’t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it’s unlikely you’d benefit from surgery.
You’ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger – every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm.
You will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including:
stopping smoking
eating a balanced diet
ensuring you maintain a healthy weight
taking regular exercise
If you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. Aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers.
Read more about
stopping smoking
and
nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs)
that can make it easier to stop smoking.
Your GP will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have:
high blood pressure
– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
high cholesterol – which you will probably be treated for with a medication called a
statin
Treating a ruptured AAA
Emergency treatment for a ruptured AAA is based on the same principle as preventative treatment. Grafts are used to repair the ruptured aneurysm.
The decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation.
Preventing an abdominal aortic aneurysm
The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels.
This includes:
smoking
eating a high-fat diet
not exercising regularly
being overweight or obese
If your GP finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. This will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
Smoking
Smoking is a major risk factor for aneurysms because it causes atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and raises your blood pressure.
Tobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries.
It is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an AAA.
The more you smoke, the greater your risk. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.
If you want to stop smoking, your GP will be able to refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit.
You can also call or chat online with
Quit Your Way Scotland
. The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.

stopping smoking
and
nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs)
, which can make it easier to quit.
Diet
Eating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis.
It’s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon.
This is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls.

healthy eating
and how to
reduce the amount of saturated fat you eat
.
Exercise
Being active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.
Regular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.
Adults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week.
Examples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking.
For it to count, the activity should make you feel warm and slightly out of breath. Someone who is overweight may only have to walk up a slope to get this feeling.
Physical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening.
Get more ideas on
being active
.
Weight
Being overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. This can raise your blood pressure, which in turn puts pressure on your arteries.
Use a
BMI healthy weight calculator
to find out if you need to lose weight.
If you need to shed some weight, it’s worth remembering that losing just a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health.

About acute myeloid leukaemia
Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment.
Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are:
lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections
myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage
This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately:
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
chronic myeloid leukaemia
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Signs and symptoms of AML
The
symptoms of AML
usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include:
pale skin
tiredness
breathlessness
frequent infections
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or
nosebleeds
In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding.
Read more about the
complications of AML
Seeking medical advice
You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it’s highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated.
If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they’ll arrange
blood tests
to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there’s a problem, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment.
Read more about
diagnosing AML
What causes AML?
AML occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells.
Blast cells don’t have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot).
It’s not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there’s no identifiable cause. However, a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include:
previous
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous  radiotherapy treatment)
exposure to benzene – a chemical used in manufacturing that’s also found in cigarette smoke
having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as
Down’s syndrome
Read more about the
causes of AML
Who’s affected
AML is a rare type of cancer. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It’s most common in people over 65.
How AML is treated
AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed.
Chemotherapy
is the main treatment for AML. It’s used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).
In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a
bone marrow or stem cell transplant
, to achieve a cure.
Read more about
treating AML
Symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia
The symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.
Symptoms of AML can include:
pale skin
tiredness
breathlessness
a high temperature (fever)
excessive sweating
weight loss
frequent infections
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or
nosebleeds
easily bruised skin
flat red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)
bone and joint pain
a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen
In rare cases of AML, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. This can cause symptoms such as
headaches
, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you or your child have these symptoms. Although it’s highly unlikely that AML is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated promptly.
Causes of acute myeloid leukaemia
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells.
The mutation causes the stem cells to produce many more white blood cells that are needed.
The white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don’t have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as ‘blast cells’.
As the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it’s this fall that causes many of the
symptoms of leukaemia
.
Increased risk
It’s not known what triggers the genetic mutation in AML, although a number of different factors that can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified.
The main risk factors for AML are outlined below.
Radiation exposure
Being exposed to a significant level of radiation can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945.
In the UK, most people are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML. However, some people who have had
radiotherapy
as part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception.
Benzene and smoking
Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it’s also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.
Benzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML.
Previous cancer treatment
Treatment with radiotherapy and certain
chemotherapy
medications for an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later.
Leukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called ‘secondary leukaemia’ or ‘treatment-related leukaemia’.
Blood disorders
People with certain blood disorders – such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or
polycythaemia
vera (PCV) – have an increased risk of developing AML.
Genetic disorders
People with certain genetic disorders, including
Down’s syndrome
and Fanconi’s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia.
Other suggested triggers
A number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there’s no clear evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML.
Diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia
In the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have
blood tests
.
A high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. If this is the case, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).
A haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page.
Bone marrow biopsy
To confirm a diagnosis of AML, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a
local anaesthetic
.
The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together.
You won’t feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight.
The bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have.
Further tests
Additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below.
Genetic testing
Genetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. There are many specific genetic variations that can occur in AML, and knowing the exact type of AML you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment.
For example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA).
Scans
If you have AML, a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
,
X-ray
or echocardiogram (an
ultrasound
scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.
These tests are carried out because it’s important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you.
Lumbar puncture
In rare situations where it’s thought there’s a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a
lumbar puncture
may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells.
If cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment.
Treating acute myeloid leukaemia
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed.
As AML is a complex condition, it’s usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) – a group of different specialists working together.
Your treatment plan
Treatment for AML is often carried out in 2 stages:
induction – the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have
consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body
The induction stage of treatment isn’t always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin.
If you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. This may be the same as your first treatment, although it’s likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant.
If you’re thought to have a high risk of experiencing
complications of AML treatment
– for example, if you’re over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition – less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. This is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.
Induction
The initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you’re fit enough to have intensive
chemotherapy
, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.
Intensive chemotherapy
If you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you’ll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow.
This stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you’ll need very close medical and nursing supervision.
You’ll have regular
blood transfusions
because your blood won’t contain enough healthy blood cells.
You’ll also be vulnerable to infection, so it’s important that you’re in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent further infection.
Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. You may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.
For intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that’s inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC).
In very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that’s placed into your spine, in a similar way to a
lumbar puncture
.
Side effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include:
nausea
vomiting
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
sore mouth and
mouth ulcers
(mucositis)
tiredness
skin rashes
hair loss
infertility
– which may be temporary or permanent (see
complications of AML
for more information)
Most side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
Non-intensive chemotherapy
If your doctors don’t think you’re fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it.
The main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment.
The medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis.
All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA)
If you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you’ll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy.
ATRA works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly.
Side effects of ATRA can include
headaches
, nausea, bone pain, and
dry mouth
, skin and eyes.
Consolidation
If induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation.
This often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.
The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.
Other treatments
Many other treatments are used for AML.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are 2 main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML:
to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant
to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon
Side effects of radiotherapy
can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed.
Bone marrow and stem cell transplants
If chemotherapy doesn’t work, a possible alternative treatment option is a
bone marrow or stem cell transplant
.
Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication.
This process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks.
Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.
Transplantations are most successful when they’re carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there’s a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.

bone marrow donation
Azacitidine
Azacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with AML who can’t have a stem cell transplant.
It’s recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in certain circumstances – for example, depending on the characteristics of the person’s blood and bone marrow.
Azacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that’s given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells.
NICE has more information about
azacitidine for the treatment of AML
Clinical trials and newer unlicensed treatments
In the UK, a number of clinical trials are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating AML. Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML.
As part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your AML, and AML in general. Search for
clinical trials for AML
.
If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn’t licensed for use in the UK and isn’t normally available. However, there’s no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments.
Your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.
Complications of acute myeloid leukaemia
If you have acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), you may experience a number of complications. These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.
Weakened immune system
Having a weakened immune system – being immunocompromised – is a common complication of AML.
Even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat AML can temporarily weaken your immune system.
This means you’re more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. Complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with AML. However, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.
Therefore, you may be advised to:
take regular doses of
antibiotics
to prevent bacterial infections
maintain good personal and dental hygiene
avoid contact with anyone who’s known to have an infection – even if it’s a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as
chickenpox
or
measles
check with your GP to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although you won’t be able to have any vaccine that contains ‘live’ viruses or bacteria, such as the
shingles vaccine
and
MMR vaccine
(against measles, mumps and rubella)
Report any possible symptoms of an infection to your treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.
Symptoms of an infection can include:
a high temperature (fever)
a
headache
aching muscles
diarrhoea
tiredness
Bleeding
If you have AML, you’ll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive.
People with advanced AML are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition.
Serious bleeding can occur:
inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion
inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, breathing difficulties and a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)
inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as vomiting blood and passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colour
All these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.
Infertility
Many of the treatments that are used to treat AML can cause
infertility
. This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.
People who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses of
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
in preparation for a
bone marrow or stem cell transplant
.
Your treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances.
It may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have their sperm samples stored. Similarly, women can have eggs or fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment.
However, as AML is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start."

About acne
Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that’s hot or painful to touch.
Acne most commonly develops on the:
face – this affects almost everyone with acne
back – this affects more than half of people with acne
chest – this affects about 15% of people with acne
Types of spots
There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne:
blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they’re not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring)
whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won’t empty when squeezed
papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore
pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus
nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful
cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they’re large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring
Papules are small red bumps that may feel tender or sore.

What can I do if I have acne?
The self-help techniques below may be useful:
Don’t wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse
Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse
Don’t try to “clean out” blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring
Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin)
Completely remove make-up before going to bed
If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient
Regular exercise can’t improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne
Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face
Although acne can’t be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it’s a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice.
Treatments can take up to 3 months to work, so don’t expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.
When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Acne treatment from your pharmacy
If you have acne you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Acne isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with
antibiotics
or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. Your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your GP for further treatment.
If you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your GP to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.
Why do I have acne?
Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.
Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).
This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.
The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn’t help to remove this blockage.
Other possible causes
Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also have acne.
Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.
There’s no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.

causes of acne
, including some common acne myths.
Who’s affected?
Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne.
Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19.
Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties.
In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.

Causes of acne
Acne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked.
Sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.
Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.
In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.
If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.
Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.
Testosterone
Teenage acne is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls.
The sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones. It’s thought that increased levels of testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.
Acne in families
Acne can run in families. If your parents had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also develop it.
One study has found that if both your parents had acne, you’re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you’re more likely to get adult acne too.
Acne in women
More than 80% of cases of adult acne occur in women. It’s thought that many cases of adult acne are caused by the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times.
These times include:
periods – some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period
pregnancy
– many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3 months of their pregnancy
polycystic ovary syndrome
– a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary
Other triggers
Other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include:
some cosmetic products – however, this is less common as most products are now tested, so they don’t cause spots (non-comedogenic)
certain medications – such as
steroid medications
, lithium (used to treat
depression
and
bipolar disorder
) and some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat
epilepsy
)
regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as a headband or backpack
smoking
– which can contribute to acne in older people
Acne myths
Despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood. There are many myths and misconceptions about it:
“Acne is caused by a poor diet”
So far, research hasn’t found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it’s good for your heart and your health in general.
“Acne is caused by having dirty skin and poor hygiene”
Most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so the cleanliness of your skin has no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin.
“Squeezing blackheads, whiteheads and spots is the best way to get rid of acne”
This could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring.
“Sexual activity can influence acne”
Having sex or masturbating won’t make acne any better or worse.
“Sunbathing, sunbeds and sunlamps help improve the symptoms of acne”
There’s no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer.
“Acne is infectious”
You can’t pass acne on to other people.
Diagnosing acne
Your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.
How many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is important in planning your treatment.
4 grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:
grade 1 (mild) – acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules
grade 2 (moderate) – there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face
grade 3 (moderately severe) – there’s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne
grade 4 (severe) – there’s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules
More severe acne can affect the back and neck.

Acne in women
If acne suddenly starts in adult women, it can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms such as:
excessive body hair (hirsutism)
irregular or light periods
The most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of
ultrasound scans
and
blood tests
.
Treating acne
Treatment for acne depends on how severe it is. It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.
The various treatments for acne are outlined below.
If you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.
Treatments from your GP
See your GP if your acne is more widespread, as you probably need prescription medication. For example, if:
you have a large number of papules and pustules
over-the-counter medication hasn’t worked
Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:
topical retinoids
topical
antibiotics
azelaic acid
antibiotic tablets
in women, the
combined oral contraceptive pill
isotretinoin tablets
If you have severe acne, your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have:
a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face
painful nodules
A combination of antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn’t work, a medication called isotretinoin may be prescribed.
Hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the
progestogen-only pill
or
contraceptive implant
can sometimes make acne worse.
Many of these treatments can take 2 to 3 months before they start to work. It’s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if there’s no immediate effect.
Topical treatments (gels, creams and lotions)
Benzoyl peroxide
Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.
Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It’s used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.
It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.
Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes.
Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:
dry and tense skin
a burning, itching or stinging sensation
some redness and peeling of the skin
Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.
Most people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.
Topical retinoids
Topical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating) which helps to prevent them building up within hair follicles.
Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They’re available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.
Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.
It’s important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.
Topical retinoids aren’t suitable for use during pregnancy, as there’s a risk they might cause birth defects.
The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.
A 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.
Topical antibiotics
Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They’re available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.
A 6 to 8 week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there’s a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.
Side effects are uncommon, but can include:
minor irritation of the skin
redness and burning of the skin
peeling of the skin
Azelaic acid
Azelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.
Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It’s available as a cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).
The medication doesn’t make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don’t have to avoid exposure to the sun.
You’ll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.
The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:
burning or stinging skin
itchiness
dry skin
redness of the skin
Antibiotic tablets
Antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.
In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.
It usually takes about 6 weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.
Depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4 to 6 months.
Tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.
You’ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as
condoms
, during this time.
Hormonal therapies
Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.
If you don’t already use it, your GP may recommend the
combined oral contraceptive pill
, even if you’re not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.
Co-cyprindiol
Co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne that doesn’t respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum.
You’ll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2 to 6 months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.
There’s a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop
breast cancer
in later life.
For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven’t taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5 years in their early twenties.
There’s also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk is estimated to be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.
It’s not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.
Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include:
bleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months
headaches
sore breasts
mood changes
loss of interest in sex
weight gain or weight loss
Isotretinoin
Isotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects:
it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced
it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged
it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin
it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots
However, the drug can also cause a wide range of side effects. It’s only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven’t responded to other treatments.
Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a dermatologist.
Isotretinoin is taken as a tablet. Most people take a 4 to 6 month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.
Common side effects of isotretinoin include:
inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils
changes in your blood sugar levels
inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)
inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)
blood in your urine
Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include:
inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
kidney disease
Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you’ll need a
blood test
before and during treatment.
Isotretinoin and birth defects
Isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you’re a woman of childbearing age:
don’t use isotretinoin if you’re pregnant or you think you’re pregnant
use 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1 month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1 month after treatment has finished
have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment
You’ll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you’re not currently sexually active.
If you think you may have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.
Isotretinoin is also not suitable if you’re breastfeeding.
Isotretinoin and mood changes
There have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There’s no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.
However, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.
Non-pharmaceutical treatments
Several treatments for acne don’t involve medication.
These include:
comedone extractor – a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads
chemical peels – where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it
photodynamic therapy – where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne
However, these treatments may not work and can’t be routinely recommended.
Complications of acne
Acne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. Any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it’s more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin.
Scarring can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it’s important not to do this.
There are 3 main types of acne scars:
ice pick scars – small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object
rolling scars – caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance
boxcar scars – round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin
Treating acne scarring
Treatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn’t usually available on the NHS. However, in the past, exceptions have been made when it’s been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress.
See your GP if you’re considering having cosmetic surgery. They’ll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the NHS.
Many private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. Prices can vary widely (from £500 to more than £10,000) depending on the type of treatment needed.
The
British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons
website has more information about private treatment available in your area.
It’s important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. While treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can’t get rid of them completely.
After treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance.
Some of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below.
Dermabrasion
Dermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush.
After the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars.
Laser treatment
Laser treatment can be used to treat mild to moderate acne scarring. There are 2 types of laser treatment:
ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to remove a small patch of skin around the scar to produce a new, smooth-looking area of skin
non-ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to stimulate the growth of new collagen (a type of protein found in skin), which helps to repair some of the damage caused by scarring, and improves the appearance
Punch techniques
Punch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. There are 3 types of punch technique:
punch excision – used to treat mild ice pick scars. The scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. After the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin.
punch elevation – used to treat boxcar scars. The base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. The base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it’s level with the surface of the skin. This makes the scar much less noticeable.
punch grafting – used to treat very deep ice pick scars. As with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is “plugged” with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear).
Subcision
Subcision is a surgical treatment that can be used to treat rolling scars. During surgery, the upper layer of the skin is removed from the underlying scar tissue. This allows blood to pool under the affected area. The blood clot helps form connective tissue, which pushes up the rolling scar so it’s level with the rest of the surface of the skin.
Once subscision has been completed, additional treatment, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion, can be used to further improve the appearance of the scar.
Depression
Acne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. This combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming
depressed
.
You may be depressed if during the last month you’ve often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things.
If you think that you or your child may have depression, it’s important to speak to your GP.
Treatments for depression include:
talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
a type of antidepressant called
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

Introduction
Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow
Tests for AML
Treating AML
Introduction
This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
.
For information about AML in people of all ages, read our general
AML
section.
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.
Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:
help fight infection (white cells)
carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells)
stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)
Symptoms
Many of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:
looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)
bruises or bleeding – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal
infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection
aches and pains in your bones
swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin
feeling unwell and run down
fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection
headaches and blurred vision – because of too many white blood cells
breathlessness – because of too many white blood cells.
Causes
It’s not known exactly what causes AML. Research is going on to try to find out. We do know some things might increase the risk of AML:
some genetic conditions, like
Down’s Syndrome
(a genetic condition is something you are born with)
some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes
If you’re worried about AML
If you think you might have any of the symptoms of AML, you should go to your GP. They’ll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange tests or refer you to see a specialist. Remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it’s important to go and get checked if you are worried.
Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow
To understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.
All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.
There are 3 main types of blood cells:
white blood cells – which help fight infection
red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body
platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding
The bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).
The main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.
Once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.
How leukaemia develops
In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.
They build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.
Types of leukaemia
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from 2 types of blood cells:
lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes
myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils
Leukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Tests for AML
You should speak to your GP as soon as possible if you think you have some of the
symptoms
of AML. But remember that the symptoms of AML can be caused by other things.
Visiting your GP
Your GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need to have a blood test to help diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). If you have AML, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.
This specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood disorders.
At the hospital
The haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:
blood tests
– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you; these tests may be called cytogenetics and immunophenotyping
bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing
lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells
chest
X-ray
– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest
If you have AML, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart).
This may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.
Waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a cancer support specialist on Macmillan’s
free helpline

Treating AML
The main treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is chemotherapy. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.
The treatment for AML is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you’ll be in hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell, and the staff can help if things get tough. Don’t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you’re feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines to help you feel better.
There are different phases of treatment for AML:
getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction
keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy
central nervous system (CNS) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16)
Very often, treatment is given as part of a clinical trial or research study, but it will be your decision whether to take part in the trial or not. Clinical trials help doctors to keep improving treatment for leukaemia.
You usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have AML.
You’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with. If you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenage and young adults (TYA). If you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.
Most chemotherapy for AML is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). So you’ll have a ‘line’ put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. There are different kinds of lines.
You’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around your spinal cord and brain. This is to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This type of treatment is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy.
Having chemotherapy can be hard, but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you’ll be given medicines to help you feel less sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.
There will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.
Being in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you.
Getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)
The first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.
You have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. You’ll usually have 4 cycles of chemotherapy overall with 2 courses in the induction phase. Some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. This normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.
You’ll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you’re having remission induction. This is so that the doctors can check how things are going.
Chemotherapy drugs
Drugs you may have include:
cytarabine (Ara-C)
daunorubicin, doxorubicin or idarubicin
etoposide
thioguanine
Side effects
Different chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s
chemotherapy section
.
As well as the chemotherapy drugs, you’ll be given other drugs to:
help prevent you from feeling sick or being sick
help prevent infections
protect your kidneys as sometimes when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once it can cause kidney problems
You’ll probably also need blood and platelet transfusions to top up the numbers of red cells and platelets in your blood.
Chemotherapy can cause side effects. Most of them are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:
being more at risk of infections
feeling sick
hair loss
a sore mouth
Sometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, some chemotherapy treatments can affect fertility (your ability to have a baby). If you are a young man, you will be offered the chance to store sperm before chemotherapy is started. There may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.
Remission induction is pretty intense treatment and you’ll probably feel a bit wiped out sometimes. You’ll need to stay in hospital for most of the time and you might not have the energy to do much. You might feel fed up, tearful or irritable. It’s normal to feel like this. It’s hard to be in hospital and you might worry about losing touch with your friends or falling behind at school or college. It can help to talk about this with a friend, doctor, nurse or counsellor.
Keeping the leukaemia away (post-remission treatment)
This phase of treatment is sometimes also called consolidation or intensification treatment. It’s given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as a relapse).
When you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so further treatment is needed to get rid of these cells.
You start post-remission treatment soon after you complete remission induction. You’ll usually have 2 courses of treatment. You might be given the same chemotherapy drugs you’ve had before (perhaps at similar or higher doses) or you might be given different chemotherapy drugs.
When your doctors decide what chemotherapy treatment plan to give you, they will take into account:
how well your leukaemia responded to the first lot of treatment (remission induction)
the results of the tests that were done when you were diagnosed
The following drugs may be used to treat you:
cytarabine (ara-C)
methotrexate
Central nervous system therapy (CNS)
You usually won’t need this treatment if you’re 16 or over. But if you’re under 16, you’ll probably have it.
CNS therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (The CNS or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.)
CNS therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around the spinal cord and brain.
It’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.
You’ll have a lumbar puncture before you start treatment to check for leukaemia cells in the CSF.
If there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you’ll have 2 lots of CNS therapy, 1 after each cycle of remission induction therapy.
If there are leukaemia cells in the CSF, you’ll have CNS therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your CSF have gone. You’ll then have 2 more lots of CNS therapy just to make sure.
For CNS therapy for AML, you’ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone.
Side effects
The most common side effect is feeling sick but you can be given anti-sickness treatment to help this. Rarer side effects include a headache, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours afterwards.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia-children/,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. One third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Approximately, 3 out of 4 of these are acute lymphoblastic (ALL). ALL can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1 to 4 years old.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Leukaemia
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body.
Bone marrow contains:
red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body
platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding
white blood cells, which help fight infection
There are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.
These immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection.
There are 4 main types of leukaemia:
acute lymphoblastic (ALL)
acute myeloid (AML)
chronic lymphocyte (CLL)
chronic myeloid (CML)
Chronic leukaemias usually affect adults and each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. ALL is a cancer of immature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts or blast cells.
There are two different types of lymphocytes; T-cells and B-cells. Often, leukaemia occurs at a very early stage in the immature lymphocytes, before they have developed into either T-cells or B-cells. However, if the cells have developed this far before becoming leukaemic, the type of leukaemia may be known as T-cell or B-cell leukaemia.
This page is about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
Causes
The exact cause of ALL is unknown. Research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down’s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with ALL (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing ALL themselves, although this risk is still small.
Like all cancers, ALL is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.
Signs and symptoms
As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.
Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.
A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.
At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.
How ALL is diagnosed
A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. A sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis.
A test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest X-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.
These tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia and help doctors decide on the best treatment.
Treatment
The aim of treatment for ALL is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ALL and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).
The treatment is given in several phases, or ‘blocks’.
Induction
This phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible and is usually started within days of being diagnosed. The induction phase lasts 4 to 6 weeks. A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. The sample that is taken is looked at under a microscope and when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in ‘remission’.
Consolidation and central nervous system (CNS) treatment
The next phase of treatment is aimed at maintaining the remission and preventing the spread of leukaemia cells into the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system, or CNS). CNS treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture.
After this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. This is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. The exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child’s doctor as it depends on your child’s response to treatment so far.
Further doses of chemotherapy treatment, called ‘delayed intensification’, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells.
Maintenance treatment
This phase of treatment lasts for 2 years from the start of interim maintenance for girls and 3 years from the start of interim maintenance for boys. It involves the child taking daily and weekly tablets, some children also have monthly injections of chemotherapy and oral pulses of steroids and 3-monthly intrathecal treatment.
Children will be able to take part in their normal daily activities as soon as they feel able to. Most children return to school before beginning maintenance treatment.
Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow treatment is only needed by a minority of patients and is used for children with ALL that is likely to come back following standard chemotherapy.
Testicular radiotherapy
In some situations, it may be necessary for boys to have radiotherapy to their testicles. This is because leukaemia cells can survive in the testicles despite chemotherapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) radiotherapy
Children who have leukaemia cells in their CNS when they are first diagnosed with ALL need more frequent lumbar punctures with intrathecal chemotherapy. Your child’s specialist will discuss with you which treatment and how much of it your child needs, and will answer any questions you have.
Side effects of treatment
Many cancer treatments will cause
side effects
. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.
Some of the main side effects of chemotherapy are:
hair loss
reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection
loss of appetite
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
Steroid medicines can also cause side effects such as:
increased appetite
mood changes and irritability
weight gain
muscle weakness (especially in the legs)
Most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible side effects. It’s important to discuss any side effects your child is having with the team treating them, so that they know how your child is feeling.
Late side effects of treatment
A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way their heart works and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer later in life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for ALL.
If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given enough time to decide if it is right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the condition is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the UK. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Most children with ALL are cured. If the leukaemia recurs after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Further treatment can then be given.
Long-term side effects (late side effects) are rare, and most children with ALL grow and develop normally.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

There are 4 main types of leukaemia:
acute lymphoblastic (ALL)
acute myeloid (AML)
chronic lymphocytic (CLL)
chronic myeloid (CML)
Chronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. CLL is exclusively an adult condition, whereas CML does occur rarely in children and young people. Each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment.
This page is about acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
Acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells).
Cells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. Cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated.
There are different sub-types of AML, depending on exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at, and whether the cells are differentiated. Knowing the sub-type of AML is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment.
There are several classification systems for the sub-types of AML. The most commonly used system in the UK is the French-American-British (FAB) system.
FAB classification of AML
M0 – AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation
M1 – AML without maturation
M2 – AML with maturation
M3 – Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)
M4 – Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia
M5 – Acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia
M6 – Acute erythroleukaemia
M7 – Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia
A newer system known as the WHO (World Health Organization) classification system is also sometimes used.
Causes
The exact cause of AML is unknown. Research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as
Down’s syndrome
or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child’s risk of developing AML.
AML, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.
Signs and symptoms
As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.
Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. Sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.
A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.
At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.
How AML is diagnosed
A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells.
A test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest X-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.
These tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment.
Treatment
The aim of treatment for AML is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. Usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).
The treatment usually has different phases.
Induction
This phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible. It usually involves 2 courses (cycles) of a combination of chemotherapy drugs.
A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. When there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in remission.
Post-remission treatment
When there are no signs of the leukaemia in the blood or bone marrow, further treatment is often given. This phase of the treatment aims to destroy any leukaemia cells that may be left and to help stop the AML from coming back. This treatment usually involves 2 more courses of chemotherapy.
Bone marrow transplant
This treatment is usually only used for children with AML that is likely to come back or has come back (recurred) following standard chemotherapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) treatment
AML may sometimes develop in the brain and spinal cord. This can be prevented by injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (intrathecal chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually given after each of the first 2 courses of chemotherapy. Sometimes a more intensive treatment is needed, and the intrathecal drugs are given more frequently until all the regular chemotherapy has been completed. Occasionally, radiotherapy to the brain is also necessary.
Side effects of treatment
Many cancer treatments will cause
side effects
. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.
Some of the main side effects are:
hair loss

In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.

About acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.
Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal.
Acute pancreatitis is different to
chronic pancreatitis
, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years.
The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:
suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)
feeling or being sick
diarrhoea
Read more about the
symptoms of acute pancreatitis
and
diagnosing acute pancreatitis
.
When to seek medical help
Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn’t possible, contact
NHS 24’s 111 service
or your local
out-of-hours service
for advice.
Why it happens
It’s thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to try to digest the organ.
Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to:
gallstones
– which accounts for around half of all cases
alcohol consumption – which accounts for about a quarter of all cases
By reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.
Read more about the
causes of acute pancreatitis
and
preventing acute pancreatitis
.
Who is affected?
Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age.
Men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones.
How it’s treated
Treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.
This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose.
Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.
However, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications that require additional treatment may develop.
Read more about
treating acute pancreatitis
.
Complications
About 4 out of 5 cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don’t cause any serious further problems. However, 1 in 5 cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure.
In severe cases where complications develop, there’s a high risk of the condition being fatal.
If a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it’s likely to be several weeks or months before they’re well enough to leave hospital.

Symptoms of acute pancreatitis
The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.
This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.
Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.
Acute pancreatitis caused by
gallstones
usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.
Other symptoms
Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:
nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting
diarrhoea
indigestion
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes
tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn’t possible, contact
NHS 24 111 Service
or your local
out-of-hours service
for advice.
Causes of acute pancreatitis
Most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn’t always clear.
Gallstones
Gallstones
are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas.
The blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they can start to digest the pancreas instead if the opening is blocked.
However, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don’t cause any problems.
Alcohol consumption
It’s not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. One theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it.
Whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol a week were 4 times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4 bottles of wine a week).
Binge drinking
, which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis.
Other causes
Less common causes of acute pancreatitis include:
accidental damage or injury to the pancreas – for example, during a procedure to
remove gallstones
or examine the pancreas
certain types of medication, such as some
antibiotics
or
chemotherapy
medication – acute pancreatitis can be an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people
a viral infection – such as
mumps
or
measles
a complication of
cystic fibrosis
certain rare conditions – including hyperparathyroidism, Reye’s syndrome and
Kawasaki disease
Severe pancreatitis
Little is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. Factors thought to increase your risk include:
being 70 years of age or over
being
obese
(a person is considered obese if they have a
body mass index (BMI)
of 30 or above)
having 2 or more alcoholic drinks a day
smoking
Researchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are 8 times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.
Diagnosing acute pancreatitis
Most cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications.
The doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch.
A
blood test
will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. This can detect signs of acute pancreatitis, such as a high level of 2 chemicals called lipase and amylase.
At first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You’ll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure.
People with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.
Further testing
Several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and assess your risk of developing more serious complications.
You may have any of the following tests:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, 3D image of your pancreas
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body
an ultrasound scan
– where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
An ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on
X-rays
is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken.
This test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.
Treating acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you’ll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen.
Many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.
In severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you’ll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU). In these cases, recovery may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal.
Read about the potential
complications of acute pancreatitis
for more information on severe cases.
Fluids
Your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid).
In severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body.
Nutritional support
Although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn’t restricted, some people are advised not to eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas.
Depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods for a few days or longer.
If you need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and often involves using a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube).
Oxygen
To ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving.
In severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing.
Painkillers
Acute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.
Some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you’re visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don’t be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.
Treating the underlying cause
Once the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated.
Gallstones
If a
gallstone
is responsible for the pancreatitis, you may need a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or your gallbladder may need to be removed.
Gallbladder removal surgery
may be done while you’re in hospital, or it may be planned for several weeks’ time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods.
An ERCP procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. It involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end.
X-rays
guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope to remove the gallstones.
Alcohol consumption
After recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided if this was the cause of the condition. If you find this difficult, you’ll probably need additional treatment.
Treatment options for alcohol dependence include:
one-to-one counselling
self-help groups – such as
Alcoholics Anonymous
a medication called acamprosate – which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings
Complications of acute pancreatitis
Although most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications.
Pseudocysts
Pseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. They’re a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition.
Pseudocysts usually develop 4 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. In many cases, they don’t cause any symptoms and are only detected during a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
.
However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating,
indigestion
and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain.
If the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own.
Treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or if the pseudocysts are large. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.
Pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into it through your skin. This can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.
Infected pancreatic necrosis
In around 1 in 3 severe cases of acute pancreatitis, a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs.
In infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. Without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. Necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue.
The dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. Once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (
blood poisoning
) and cause multiple organ failure. If left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal.
Infected pancreatic necrosis usually develops 2 to 6 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. Symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. The infection is treated with injections of
antibiotics
, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning.
In some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin.
Alternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used. A small cut is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. If laparoscopic surgery isn’t possible, a cut can be made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed.
Infected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. Even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1 in 5.
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
Another common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis.
In SIRS, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. It usually develops during the first week after the symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day.
Symptoms of SIRS include:
a rise in body temperature to above 38C (100.4F) or a fall in body temperature to below 36C (96.8F)
a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute
an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute)
There’s currently no cure for SIRS, so treatment involves trying to support the body’s functions until the inflammation has passed. The outcome depends on how many organs fail. The higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death.
Chronic pancreatitis
If you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to
chronic pancreatitis
.
Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life.
Preventing acute pancreatitis
As acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition.
Gallstones
The most effective way of preventing
gallstones
is eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day).
Your diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. This helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body.
There is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.
Because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it’s advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content.
Foods high in cholesterol include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter and lard
cakes and biscuits
Being overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also help reduce your risk of developing the condition.

Alcohol
Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. It can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as
liver cancer

About Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.
The adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline.
In Addison’s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.
About 8,400 people in the UK have Addison’s disease. It can affect people of any age. It’s most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It’s also more common in women than men.
Early-stage symptoms of Addison’s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as
depression
or
flu
. You may experience:
fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)
muscle weakness
low mood
loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
increased thirst
Over time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, cramps and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums.
Although these symptoms aren’t always caused by Addison’s disease, you should see your GP, so they can be investigated.
Read more about the
symptoms of Addison’s disease
and
diagnosing Addison’s disease
Why it happens
The condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It’s not clear why this happens, but it’s responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK.
Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as
tuberculosis (TB)
, although this is uncommon in the UK.
Read more about the
causes of Addison’s disease
Treating Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You’ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life.
With treatment, symptoms of Addison’s disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations.
However, many people with Addison’s disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as
diabetes
or an
underactive thyroid
.
People with Addison’s disease must be aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison’s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, phone 999 for an ambulance.

Information about you
If you have Addison’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register
Symptoms of Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.
Initial symptoms of Addison’s disease can include:
fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)
lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)
muscle weakness
low mood (mild
depression
) or irritability
loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
the need to urinate frequently
increased thirst
craving for salty foods
Dehydration
can also be an early sign of Addison’s disease. It’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.
Later symptoms
Further symptoms of Addison’s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However, additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.
You may go on to develop:
low blood pressure
when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting
diarrhoea
abdominal, joint or back pain
muscle cramps
chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression
brownish discolouration of the skin, lips and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees
a
reduced libido (lack of interest in sex)
, particularly in women
Some women may also have irregular periods or miss some periods completely. Children with Addison’s disease may experience puberty later than usual.
Some people with Addison’s disease also develop
low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)
. This can cause symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).
If you’re experiencing symptoms of Addison’s disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition. These symptoms will usually improve with appropriate treatment.
Read more about
diagnosing Addison’s disease
and
treating Addison’s disease
Adrenal crisis
If Addison’s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation called an adrenal or Addisonian crisis.
During an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison’s disease appear quickly and severely. This could happen when you’re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.
Signs of an adrenal crisis include:
severe
dehydration
pale, cold, clammy skin
sweating
rapid, shallow breathing
dizziness
severe vomiting and
diarrhoea
severe muscle weakness
headache
severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know with Addison’s disease is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance.
If an adrenal crisis isn’t treated, it can lead to a
coma
and death. There’s also a risk your brain won’t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which can cause permanent disability.
Causes of Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.
Problems with the immune system
In the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison’s disease, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases.
The immune system is your body’s defence against infection and disease. If you’re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness.
However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder.
Addison’s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won’t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you’ll experience
symptoms of Addison’s disease
.
It’s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families.
Genetics
Research has shown that some people with certain genes are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.
It’s not clear how these genes lead to Addison’s disease and similar conditions, but it does mean your risk of developing Addison’s disease is increased if you or a close family member have another autoimmune condition, such as:
vitiligo – a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin
type 1 diabetes
– a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
Other causes
Tuberculosis (TB)
is the most common cause of Addison’s disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body. It can cause Addison’s disease if it damages your adrenal glands.
Other possible causes of Addison’s disease include:
infections – such as those linked to
AIDS
, or fungal infections
a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with
meningitis
or other types of severe
sepsis
cancer – if
cancer
cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands
amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them
surgical removal of both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) – for example, to remove a tumour
adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) – a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that most often affects young boys
certain treatments needed for Cushing’s syndrome – a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body
Diagnosing Addison’s disease
To help diagnose Addison’s disease, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history.
They’re also likely to ask if anyone in your family has an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system).
Your GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as:
where skin creases on your palm
in your elbow crease
on any scars
your lips and gums
However, hyperpigmentation doesn’t occur in all cases of Addison’s disease.
You’ll also be tested for
low blood pressure (hypotension)
while you’re lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position).
Blood tests
If Addison’s disease is suspected,
blood tests
will be carried out to measure the levels of sodium, potassium and cortisol in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate Addison’s disease.
You may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood to be tested for the following:
a low level of the hormone aldosterone
a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy)
positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland)
Any of these could be a sign of Addison’s disease.
Synacthen stimulation test
If cortisol in your blood is low, or your symptoms strongly suggest Addison’s disease, you’ll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis.
Your GP may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. How urgently you’re referred depends on how severe your symptoms are.
Synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.
When synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and other steroid hormones into the blood.
A blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement.
If the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it’s usually confirmation of Addison’s disease.
Thyroid function test
As well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it’s working properly.
Your thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body’s growth and metabolism.
People with Addison’s disease often have an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
, where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism.
Scans
In some cases, your specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands. This could be a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
or a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
Diagnosis during an adrenal crisis
If Addison’s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where the
symptoms of Addison’s disease
appear quickly and severely.
During an adrenal crisis, there’s not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison’s disease.
If possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. While you’re waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose.
Read more about
treating Addison’s disease
Driving
If you’re diagnosed with Addison’s disease and have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it’s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
Read about
driving and Addison’s disease
on the GOV.UK website.
Treating Addison’s disease
If you have Addison’s disease, you’ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue.
In some cases, the underlying causes of Addison’s disease can be treated. For example,
tuberculosis (TB)
is treated with a course of
antibiotics
over a period of at least 6 months.
However, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can’t be cured.
Medication for Addison’s disease
Treatment usually involves
corticosteroid (steroid)
replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. It’s usually taken in tablet form 2 or 3 times a day.
In most cases, a medication called hydrocortisone is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.
Aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you’re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this may not be necessary. Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it.
In general, the medications used for Addison’s disease don’t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there’s a risk of problems such as
weakened bones (osteoporosis)
, mood swings and
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
.
Living with Addison’s disease
Many people with Addison’s disease find that taking their medication enables them to continue with their normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy.
Some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health. Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late, can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia.
Some people can develop associated health conditions, such as
diabetes
or an
underactive thyroid
, which require extra treatment and management.
You’ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6 to 12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary. Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits.
Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so you must:
remember to collect your repeat prescriptions
keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you
take your medication every day at the right time
pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below)
carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary
You could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.
Medical alert bracelets
It’s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people you have Addison’s disease.
After a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you’ll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis.
Wearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff treating you about your condition, and what medication you require.
Medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there’s one they recommend, or go to the
MedicAlert
website.
If you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It’s important to note that this advice still applies if you’re not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason.
Adjusting your medication
At certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following:
an illness or infection – particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F)
an accident, such as a car crash
an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy)
you’re taking part in strenuous exercise not usually part of your daily life
This will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you’re unsure.
Emergency treatment
You and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency.
This could be necessary if you go into shock after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you’re pregnant and have morning sickness. Your endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary.
If you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always phone your GP immediately afterwards. Check what
out-of-hours services
are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours.
You can also register yourself with your local
ambulance service
, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance.
Treating adrenal crisis
Adrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Phone 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis.
Signs of an adrenal crisis include:
severe
dehydration
pale, cold, clammy skin
sweating

severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness
In hospital, you’ll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You’ll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone.
Any underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated."

Anal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the very end of the large bowel.
Symptoms of anal cancer
The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles
(haemorrhoids)
and
anal fissures
(small tears or sores).
Symptoms of anal cancer can include:
bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
itching and pain around the anus
small lumps around the anus
a discharge of mucus from the anus
loss of bowel control
(bowel incontinence)
However, some people with anal cancer don’t have any symptoms.
Speak to your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they’re unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.
Diagnosing anal cancer
Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.
They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its
2015 guidelines
that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks.
If you’re referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.
Some of the tests you may have include a:
sigmoidoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities
proctoscopy – where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end
biopsy
– where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope
If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.
You can read more about the
stages of anal cancer
on the Cancer Research UK website.
How anal cancer is treated
If you’re diagnosed with anal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.
The main treatments used for anal cancer are:
chemoradiation – a combination of
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel
In cases where the cancer has spread and can’t be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as
palliative care
.
Chemoradiation
Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). It’s currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don’t usually need to stay in hospital when you’re having chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in 2 cycles, each lasting 4 to 5 days, with a 4-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished.
The tube means you don’t need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.
A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC.
Read more about
how chemotherapy is carried out
Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for 5 to 6 weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required.
Read more about
how radiotherapy is carried out
Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including:
tiredness
sore skin around the anus
sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women
hair loss
– limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area
feeling sick
diarrhoea
These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as
infertility
. If you’re concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.
Other possible long-term side effects can include:
bowel control problems
long-term (chronic) diarrhoea
erectile dysfunction
vaginal pain when having sex
dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus
bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder
Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.
Surgery
Surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. It’s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn’t worked.
If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under
general anaesthetic
, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days.
If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.
An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.
During the operation, a permanent
colostomy
will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.
Before and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.
Read more about
living with a colostomy
Follow-up
After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually become less frequent over time.
What causes anal cancer?
The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:
infection with
human papilloma virus (HPV)
– a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body
having anal sex or lots of sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV
having a history of
cervical
,
vaginal
or
vulval cancer
smoking
having a weakened immune system – for example, if you have
HIV
Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/acute-cholecystitis/,"Acute cholecystitis
Acute cholecystitis is swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder. It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital.
The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder.
The affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.
Unlike some others types of
abdominal pain
, the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn’t go away within a few hours.
Some people may additional symptoms, such as:
a high temperature (fever)
nausea and vomiting
sweating
loss of appetite
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
a bulge in the abdomen
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP practice if:
you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if the pain lasts longer than a few hours or you have other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
It’s important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly.
What causes acute cholecystitis?
The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.
Calculous cholecystitis
Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.
Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a
gallstone
or by a substance known as biliary sludge.
Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.
The blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around 1 in every 5 cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.
Acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or
burns
,
blood poisoning (sepsis)
, severe
malnutrition
or
AIDS
.
Who is affected
Acute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones.
It’s estimated that around 10% to 15% of adults in the UK have gallstones. These don’t usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.
Diagnosing cholecystitis
To diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen.
They will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy’s sign. You will be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP’s hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage.
Your gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor’s hand.
If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment.
Tests you may have in hospital include:
blood tests
to check for signs of inflammation in your body
an
ultrasound scan
of your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder
Other scans – such as an
X-ray
, a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
or a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there is any uncertainty about your diagnosis.
Treating acute cholecystitis
If you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.
Initial treatment
Initial treatment will usually involve:
fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder
receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent
dehydration
taking medication to relieve your pain
If you have a suspected infection, you will also be given
antibiotics
. These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home.
With this initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused the condition usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation often settles down.
Surgery
In order to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring, and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications, the removal of your gallbladder will often be recommended at some point after the initial treatment. This type of surgery is known as a
cholecystectomy
.
Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder.
If you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. In some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks.
Surgery can be carried out in two main ways:
laparoscopic cholecystectomy – a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen
open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomen
Although some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and
diarrhoea
after eating certain foods, you can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.
The organ can be useful but it’s not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food.
Possible complications
Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
The main complications of acute cholecystitis are:
the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body
the gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess)
In about 1 in every 5 cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications.
Preventing acute cholecystitis
It’s not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones.
One of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is adopting a healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.
Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.
However, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.

About Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people in the UK.
Dementia
is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory.
The exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:
increasing age
a family history of the condition
previous
severe head injuries
lifestyle factors and conditions associated with
cardiovascular disease
It’s becoming increasingly understood that it’s very common to have both changes of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia).
Read more about the
causes of Alzheimer’s disease
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions.
The first sign of Alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.
As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as:
confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places
difficulty planning or making decisions
problems with speech and language
problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks
personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others
hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue)
low mood or anxiety
Read more about the
symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
Who is affected?
Alzheimer’s disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men.
The risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80.
However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer’s disease affects people aged 40 to 65.
Receiving a diagnosis
As the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there’s a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older.
However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help.
If you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.
There’s no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions.
If Alzheimer’s disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:
discuss the process of making the diagnosis
organise testing
create a treatment plan

diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease
How Alzheimer’s disease is treated
There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people.
Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer’s live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it’s easier to move around and remember daily tasks.
Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.
Read more about
treating Alzheimer’s disease
Outlook
On average, people with Alzheimer’s disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not.
Alzheimer’s disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause.
As Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It’s also common for people with Alzheimer’s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.
There’s increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer’s disease need
palliative care
. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer’s.
Can Alzheimer’s disease be prevented?
As the exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease isn’t clear, there’s no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as:
stopping smoking
and
cutting down on alcohol
eating a
healthy, balanced diet
and maintaining a healthy weight
staying
physically fit
and mentally active
These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.

Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease progress slowly over several years. Sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age.
The rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual and it’s not possible to predict exactly how quickly it will get worse.
In some cases, infections, medications, strokes or delirium can be responsible for symptoms getting worse. Anyone with Alzheimer’s disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor, so these can be managed.
Stages of Alzheimer’s disease
Generally, the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are divided into three main stages.
Early symptoms
In the early stages, the main symptom of Alzheimer’s disease is memory lapses. For example, someone with early Alzheimer’s disease may:
forget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items
forget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word
repeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times
show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions
become less flexible and more hesitant to try new things
There are often signs of mood changes, such as increasing
anxiety
or agitation, or periods of confusion.
Middle-stage symptoms
As Alzheimer’s disease develops, memory problems will get worse. Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends.
Other symptoms may also develop, such as:
increasing confusion and disorientation – for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is
obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour
delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members
problems with speech or language (aphasia)
disturbed sleep
changes in mood, such as frequent mood swings,
depression
and feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated
difficulty performing spatial tasks, such as judging distances
hallucinations
By this stage, someone with Alzheimer’s disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. For example, they may need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet.
Later symptoms
In the later stages of Alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.
Hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get worse as the condition progresses. Sometimes people with Alzheimer’s disease can be violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them.
A number of other symptoms may also develop as Alzheimer’s disease progresses, such as:
difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia)
difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance
considerable weight loss – although some people eat too much and put on weight
unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence)
or stools (
bowel incontinence
)
gradual loss of speech
significant problems with short- and long-term memory
In the severe stages of Alzheimer’s disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and using the toilet.

how Alzheimer’s disease is treated
Seeking medical advice
If you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.
Memory problems are not just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems. Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary.
Read more about
diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease
Causes of Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas.
It’s not known exactly what causes this process to begin. However, in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have found amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine.
It’s also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain.
These reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them.
Over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories.
Increased risk
Although it’s still unknown what triggers Alzheimer’s disease, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition.
Age
Age is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age.
However, it’s not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Around 1 in 20 people with the condition are under 65. This is called early onset Alzheimer’s disease and it can affect people from around the age of 40.
Family history
The genes you inherit from your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a close family member with the condition.
However, in a few families, Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition being passed on are much higher.
If several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling for information and advice about your chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease when you are older.
The Alzheimer’s Society website has more information about the
genetics of dementia
.
Down’s syndrome
People with Down’s syndrome are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
This is because the genetic fault that causes Down’s syndrome can also cause amyloid plaques to build up in the brain over time, which can lead to Alzheimer’s disease in some people.
Head injuries
People who have had a
severe head injury
have been found to be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
Cardiovascular disease
Research shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated with
cardiovascular disease
can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
These include:
smoking
obesity
diabetes
high blood pressure
high cholesterol
You can help reduce your risk by:
stopping smoking
eating a healthy, balanced diet
leading an active life, both physically and mentally
losing weight if you need to
drinking less alcohol
having regular health checks as you get older
Read more about
reducing your risk of Alzheimer’s disease
Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease
It’s best to see your GP if you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia.
If you’re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going with them. It’s often very helpful having a friend or family member there.
A timely diagnosis gives you the best chance to adjust, prepare and plan for the future, as well as accessing treatments and support that may help.
Seeing your GP
Memory problems aren’t just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by:
depression
or
anxiety
stress
medications
alcohol or drugs
other health problems – such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficiencies
Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary.
Your GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. They’ll also check other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. They may also organise some
blood tests
and ask about any medication you’re taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
You’ll usually be asked some questions and carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. This can help your GP decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments.
Referral to a specialist
Your GP may refer you to a specialist memory assessment service to help with your diagnosis. Memory clinics are staffed by professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.
Memory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area:
a nurse – usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia
a psychologist – a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions
a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor who has training in treating mental health conditions
a neurologist – a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)
a geriatrician – a physician with specialist training in the care of older people
a social worker – a trained member of staff able to advise and assist with accessing social services within the local area
an occupational therapist – a member of staff with specialist skills in assessing and supporting people with dementia and their families with adjusting to disabilities
There’s no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease, but the staff will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking. They will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions.
Assessing your mental abilities
A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions.
One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). This involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. Different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests.
The MMSE isn’t used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s useful to initially assess areas of difficulty that a person with the condition may have. This helps specialists to make decisions about treatment and whether more tests are necessary.
Tests
To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer’s disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan. This could be a:
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brain
Some specialist centres offer scans which look at brain function and particular protein deposits. However, at the moment, these are mostly experimental and only used if the diagnosis is unclear.
After diagnosis
It may take several appointments and tests over months, or even years, before a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can be confirmed.
For some people, a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is a huge shock, especially as it’s not unusual for people with dementia to have less awareness of their difficulties.
For others, the diagnosis can be very important in helping them and their families to make sense of symptoms they’ve been concerned about for a long time.
If you’ve just been given a diagnosis of dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. It may be helpful to have the diagnosis explained again to help make sense of the idea over time. It might help to talk things through with family and friends.
It takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family. Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news.
However, as dementia is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis is often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.

what to do if you’ve just been diagnosed with dementia
Treating Alzheimer’s disease
There’s currently no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, although medication is available that can temporarily reduce some symptoms or slow down the progression of the condition in some people.
Support is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life.
Care plan
If you’re diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, it’s helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for the future.
A care plan is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as:
what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible
whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in
whether you need any financial assistance
Healthcare professionals (such as your GP or psychiatrist) and
social care services
(which is normally your local council working with the NHS), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans.
Medication
A number of medications may be prescribed for Alzheimer’s disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition.
Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine (known as AChE inhibitors) can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take AChE inhibitors, or for those with late-stage disease.
There’s no difference in how well each of the three different AChE inhibitors work, although some people respond better to certain types or have fewer side effects.
All of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. They may be prescribed by your GP on the advice of a specialist.
If you’re caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. These assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects.
Read guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on
donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease
.
Side effects
Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine can cause side effects such as:
feeling and being sick
dizziness
diarrhoea
headache
agitation
insomnia
muscle cramps
more rarely, slowing of the heartbeat – which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm.
These side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. Your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions.
Common side effects of memantine include:
dizziness
headaches
high blood pressure
tiredness
constipation
shortness of breath
more rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion
very rarely, seizures
For more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor.
Supportive measures and treatments
In addition to medication, treatment for Alzheimer’s disease involves a wide range of other measures and treatments to help people with dementia live as independently as possible.
For example, an
occupational therapist
can identify problems or unsafe areas in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. They may suggest:
ways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks – such as using diaries or calendars
assistive technology – devices or systems to help maintain the independence and safety of people living with dementia
adding grab bars and handrails to your home to help you move around safely
other professionals visiting you at home and assisting with daily tasks to maintain your independence in the community
Psychological treatments, such as cognitive stimulation, may be offered to help improve your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.
Medication, other psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), music and art therapy, reminiscence and relaxation therapies may also be offered. These may help with managing
depression
, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and challenging behaviour that can occur with Alzheimer’s disease.

Practical tips for people with Alzheimer’s
If you have Alzheimer’s disease, you may find it useful to:
keep a diary and write down things you want to remember
pin a weekly timetable to the wall
put your keys in an obvious place, such as in a large bowl in your living room
have a daily newspaper delivered to remind you of the day and date
put labels on cupboards and drawers
keep useful telephone numbers by the phone
write yourself reminders – for example, put a note on the front door to remind you to take your keys with you if you go out
programme people’s names and numbers into your telephone
set the alarm on your watch to act as a reminder
install safety devices such as gas detectors and smoke alarms throughout your home
It may also be helpful to get in touch with a local or national Alzheimer’s or dementia support group, such as the
Alzheimer’s Society
, for more information and advice about living with Alzheimer’s disease.

living well with dementia
Future care planning
People with dementia often live for many years after their diagnosis. However, as it’s a progressive condition, it can be helpful and reassuring for both you and your family if you make plans for the future.
Future care planning
means considering, discussing and possibly recording your wishes and decisions for future care. It’s about planning for a time when you may not be able to make some decisions for yourself.
In the earlier stages of the disease, you should have the opportunity to discuss with health professionals and your family about the future. This may involve the use of:
advance statements
advance decisions to refuse treatment
lasting power of attorney
preferred priorities for care
Palliative care
Although the outlook is variable, dementia is a life-limiting illness and can begin to affect multiple body systems in the later stages.
End of life care, or palliative care, provides support for people with an incurable illness, so they’re able to live as well and as comfortably as possible until their death. It also involves support for family members. Care may be provided at home, a hospice, a care home or hospital.
For people nearing the end of life, their care team should assess their needs, make them feel comfortable and allow them to die with dignity in a place of their choosing.

Preventing Alzheimer’s disease
As the exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still unknown, there’s no way to prevent the condition. However, there are steps you can take that may help to delay the onset of dementia.
Reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease
has been linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
You may be able to reduce your risk of developing these conditions – as well as other serious problems, such as
strokes
and
heart attacks
– by taking steps to improve your cardiovascular health, including:
stopping smoking
not drinking large amounts of alcohol
eating a healthy, balanced diet
, including at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day
exercising for at least 150 minutes
(2 hours and 30 minutes) every week by doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) – this will improve both your physical and mental health
make sure your blood pressure is checked and controlled through regular health tests
if you have
diabetes
, make sure you keep to the diet and take your medication
Read more about
preventing dementia
Staying mentally active
There’s some evidence to suggest that rates of dementia are lower in people who remain as mentally, physically and socially active as possible throughout their lives, as well as among those who enjoy a wide range of different activities and hobbies.
It may be possible to reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia by:
reading
writing for pleasure
learning foreign languages
playing musical instruments
taking part in adult education courses
playing tennis
playing golf
swimming
group sports, such as bowling
walking
Interventions such as “brain training” computer games have been shown to improve cognition over a short period, but research hasn’t yet demonstrated whether this can prevent dementia.
Future research
Research into Alzheimer’s disease is continuing. As more is revealed about the condition, other ways to treat or prevent it may be found.
Participation in research is important and helps to improve dementia care and support for people with dementia, plus their carers and families.
You can read about ongoing dementia research on the
Alzheimer’s Research UK
website. You can also ask your local memory clinic about projects taking place.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has advised that there isn’t evidence to support the use of the following to prevent dementia:
statins
hormone replacement therapy
– when chemicals are taken to replace those that your body no longer produces
vitamin E
– found in a variety of foods, such as olive oil, nuts and seeds
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"

About allergies
An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance.
Allergies are very common. They’re thought to affect more than 1 in 4 people in the UK at some point in their lives.
They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren’t previously allergic to.
Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon.
Common allergies
Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include:
grass and tree pollen – an allergy to these is known as
hay fever
(allergic rhinitis)
dust mites
animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair)
food
– particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow’s milk
insect bites and stings
medication – including
ibuprofen
, aspirin, and certain
antibiotics
latex – used to make some gloves and
condoms
mould – these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in
household chemicals – including those in detergents and hair dyes
Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren’t allergic to them.
Symptoms of an allergic reaction
Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.
They can cause:
sneezing
a runny or blocked nose
red, itchy, watery eyes
wheezing and coughing
a red, itchy rash
worsening of
asthma
or
eczema
symptoms
Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called
anaphylaxis
or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.

When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Allergies treatment from your pharmacy
If you have allergies you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Getting help for allergies
If your pharmacist thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. See your pharmacist if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your pharmacist can help determine whether it’s likely you have an allergy.
If your allergy is particularly severe or it’s not clear what you’re allergic to, the pharmacist may advise you see your GP who may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment.
Read more about
allergy testing
.
How to manage an allergy
In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible.
For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food’s ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more
information about food allergen labelling
.
There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including:
antihistamines – these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring
decongestants
– tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose
lotions and creams, such as moisturising creams (emollients) – these can reduce skin redness and itchiness
steroid medication
– sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction
For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended.
This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn’t react to it so severely.

treating an allergy
and
avoiding allergic reactions

What causes allergies?
Allergies occur when the body’s immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it’s harmful.
It’s not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema.
The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it’s the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with.
It’s thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances.
Symptoms of allergies
Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you’re allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours.
Although allergic reactions can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called
anaphylaxis
can occur.
Main allergy symptoms
Common symptoms of an allergic reaction include:
sneezing and an itchy, runny or blocked nose (
allergic rhinitis
)
itchy, red, watering eyes (
conjunctivitis
)
wheezing, chest tightness,
shortness of breath
and a
cough
a raised, itchy, red rash (
hives
)
swollen lips, tongue, eyes or face
tummy pain
, feeling sick,
vomiting
or
diarrhoea
dry, red and cracked skin
The symptoms vary depending on what you’re allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you may have a runny nose if exposed to pollen, develop a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick if you eat something you’re allergic to.
See your pharmacist if you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about
diagnosing allergies
.
Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
In rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening.
This affects the whole body and usually develops within minutes of exposure to something you’re allergic to.
Signs of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as:
swelling of the throat and mouth
difficulty breathing
lightheadedness
confusion
blue skin or lips
collapsing and losing consciousness
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Read more about
anaphylaxis
for information about what to do if it occurs.
Testing for allergies
If you think you have an allergy, tell your pharmacist about the symptoms you’re having, when they happen, how often they occur and if anything seems to trigger them. Your pharmacist can offer advice and treatment for mild allergies with a clear cause.
If your allergy is more severe or it’s not obvious what you’re allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP as you may need referred for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic.
The tests that may be carried out are described below.
Skin prick testing
Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.
It involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes.
Skin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don’t take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results.
Blood tests
Blood tests
may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies.
A sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen.
Patch tests
Patch tests are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen.
A small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction.
Elimination diet
If you have a suspected
food allergy
, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve.
After a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction.
Don’t attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional.
Challenge testing
In a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy.
During the test, you’re given the food you think you’re allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision.
This test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop.
Treating allergies
The treatment for an allergy depends on what you’re allergic to. In many cases your pharmacist will be able to offer advice and treatment.
They’ll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you’re allergic to, and can recommend medication to control your symptoms.
Avoiding exposure to allergens
The best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you’re allergic to, although this isn’t always practical.
For example, you may be able to help manage:
food allergies
by being careful about what you eat
animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly
mould allergies by keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation
hay fever
by staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high
dust mite allergies by using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets
Read more about
preventing allergic reactions
.
Allergy medications
Medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on the
Pharmacy First Scotland service
without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they’re not suitable for everyone.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines are the main medicines for allergies. They can be used:
as and when you notice the symptoms of an allergic reaction
to prevent allergic reactions – for example, you may take them in the morning if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day
Antihistamines can be taken as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy.
Decongestants
Decongestants
can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction.
They can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don’t use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse.
Lotions and creams
Red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as:
emollients (moisturising creams) to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens
calamine lotion to reduce itchiness
steroids to reduce inflammation (see below)
Steroids
Steroid medications
can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction. They’re available as:
nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed nose and eyes
creams for
eczema
and contact dermatitis
inhalers for
asthma
tablets for
hives (urticaria)
Sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams, inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP.
Immunotherapy (desensitisation)
Immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above.
The treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen – either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue – over the course of several years.
The injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be taken at home.
The aim of treatment is to help your body get used to the allergen so it doesn’t react to it so severely. This won’t necessarily cure your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.
Treating severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known as
anaphylaxis
or anaphylactic shock.
If you’re at risk of this, you’ll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency.
If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help.
Read more about the
treating anaphylaxis
.
Preventing an allergic reaction
The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you’re allergic to, although this isn’t always easy or practical.
Below is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens.
House dust mites
One of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. You can limit the number of mites in your home by:
choosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet
fitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean
choosing leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture
cleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming
using tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows
using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners
regularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth – avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the air
Concentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room.
You can find more information on
indoor allergies in the home
on the Allergy UK website.
Pets
It’s not the pet fur that causes an allergic reaction. Instead, it’s flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine.
If you can’t permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try:
keeping pets outside as much as possible, or limiting them to a particular area of the house, preferably an area without carpet
not allowing pets in bedrooms
washing pets at least once a week
regularly grooming pets outside
regularly washing all bedding and soft furnishings on which a pet has lain
using an air filter in rooms where you spend most of your time
increase ventilation with fans, air-conditioning or by opening windows
If you’re visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you’re visiting, as this will stir up the allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine about an hour before entering a pet-inhabited house can also help reduce your symptoms.
The Allergy UK website has more information about
domestic pet allergies
.
Mould spores
Tiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people.
You can help prevent this by:
keeping your home dry and well-ventilated
removing any indoor pot plants from your home
not drying clothes indoors, store clothes in damp cupboards or packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes
dealing with any damp and condensation in your home
avoiding damp buildings, damp woods and rotten leaves, cut grass and compost heaps
Food allergies
By law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that’s known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction.
People with food allergies most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by:
not relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens)
communicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice
avoiding places where there’s a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries
let restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is
always check what allergens are in the dish even if you have eaten it before, as recipes and ingredients can change
Remember, simple dishes are less likely to contain “hidden” ingredients. If you’re not sure about a dish, don’t risk it
Read more about
living with a food allergy
and
advice from the Food Standards Agency on food allergen labelling
.
Hay fever
Pollen allergies – more commonly known as
hay fever
– are caused when trees and grasses release pollen into the air. Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis.
Different plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses).
To help keep your hay fever under control, you can:
check weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it’s high, if possible
avoid drying clothes and bedding outside when the pollen count is high
wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes
keep doors and windows shut when possible
shower and change your clothes after being outside
avoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields – particularly in the early morning, evening or night, when the pollen count is highest
if you have a lawn, try asking someone else to cut the grass for you
Insect bites and stings
If you’ve ever suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting, it’s important to take precautions to minimise your risk.
When you’re outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could:
cover exposed skin
wear shoes
apply insect repellent
avoid wearing strong perfumes or fragrances, as these can attract insects
Read more about
preventing insect bites and stings
.
Preventing severe allergies (anaphylaxis)
If you’re at risk of experiencing a severe allergic reaction (
anaphylaxis
), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors with you everywhere.
Wearing a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag medallion or bracelet can make others aware of your allergy in an emergency.
Consider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance.

About alcohol-related liver disease
Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.
ARLD doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include:
feeling sick
weight loss
loss of appetite
yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)
swelling in the ankles and tummy
confusion or drowsiness
vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools
This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage.
If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged.
Read more about:
symptoms of ARLD
diagnosing ARLD
Alcohol and the liver
With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include:
filtering toxins from the blood
aiding digestion of food
regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels
helping fight infection and disease
The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die.
The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged
alcohol misuse
(drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver.
ARLD is very common in the UK – the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse.
Read more about the
causes of ARLD
.
Stages of ARLD
There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there’s often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below.
Alcoholic fatty liver disease
Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD.
Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it’s an important warning sign that you’re drinking at a harmful level.
Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2 weeks, your liver should return to normal.
Alcoholic hepatitis
Alcoholic hepatitis – which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis – is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they’re damaging their liver through alcohol.
Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time
(binge drinking)
.
The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.
Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.
Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis
is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.
It’s generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.
A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn’t stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5 more years.
How ARLD is treated
There’s currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering.
If a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol
support services
.
A
liver transplant
may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn’t improve when you stop drinking alcohol.
You’ll only be considered for a liver transplant if you’ve developed complications of
cirrhosis
, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life.
Read more about
treating ARLD
.
Complications
Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with
smoking
and
high blood pressure
.
Life-threatening complications of ARLD include:
internal (variceal) bleeding
build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy)
fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure
liver cancer
Read more about the
complications of ARLD
.
Preventing ARLD
The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the
low-risk drinking guidelines
.
Even if you’ve been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.
Read our
drinking and alcohol
pages for more information and advice.
Symptoms of alcohol-related liver disease
In many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don’t have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged.
Early symptoms
If you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these are often quite vague, such as:
abdominal pain
loss of appetite
fatigue
feeling sick
diarrhoea
feeling generally unwell
Advanced symptoms
As the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as:
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)
swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites
a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks
very itchy skin
hair loss
unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers)
blotchy red palms
significant weight loss
weakness and muscle wasting
confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (
insomnia
) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain
vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding
a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent
nosebleeds
and bleeding gums
increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can’t process them)
When to seek medical advice
ARLD doesn’t often cause symptoms until it’s reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of these symptoms.
Read about
alcohol misuse (drinking too much)
.
Contact your GP for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse.
A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4 questions:
Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking?
Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever drunk an ‘eye-opener’, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves?
If you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP.
See your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.

Causes of alcohol-related liver disease
Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD.
There are 2 ways
alcohol misuse
(drinking too much) can cause ARLD. These are:
drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time
(binge drinking)
can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis
drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause hepatitis and
cirrhosis
, the more serious types of ARLD
Evidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD.

alcohol units and how to calculate them.
Additional factors
As well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These include:
being overweight or
obese
being female – women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol
having a pre-existing liver condition, such as
hepatitis C
genetics – alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families
Diagnosing alcohol-related liver disease
Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver.
This is because the condition causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages.
If a doctor suspects ARLD, they’ll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption.
It’s important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.
Blood tests
Blood tests
used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease.
Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn’t functioning properly.
A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage.
Lab Tests Online has more information on
liver function tests
.
Further testing
If your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD – either alcoholic hepatitis or
cirrhosis
– you may need further tests.
Imaging tests
Scans may be needed to produce detailed images of your liver. This may include:
an
ultrasound scan
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.
Liver biopsy
During a liver
biopsy
, a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.
The biopsy is usually carried out under
local anaesthetic
, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital.
Specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.
Endoscopy
An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. During an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach.
Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.
Treating alcohol-related liver disease
Successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.
Stopping drinking alcohol
Treatment for ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at.
If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2 weeks. After this point, it’s usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the
NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption
.
If you have a more serious form of ARLD – alcoholic hepatitis or
cirrhosis
– life-long abstinence is recommended. This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease.
Stopping drinking isn’t easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem.
Nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don’t stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.
Withdrawal symptoms
If you’re abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes 3 to 7 days from the time of your last drink.
Many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month.
In some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process.
Some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so their progress can be closely monitored.
If you’re staying at home, you’ll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service.
Preventing relapses
Once you’ve stopped drinking, you may need further treatment to help ensure you don’t start drinking again.
The first treatment usually offered is psychological therapy. This involves seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing.
If psychological therapy alone isn’t effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:
acamprosate
naltrexone
disulfiram
Read our page on
treating alcohol misuse
for more information on the treatments offered.
Self-help groups
Many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is
Alcoholics Anonymous
, but there are many other groups that can help.
Read the
alcohol support
page for more information about the help available.
Diet and nutrition
Malnutrition
is common in people with ARLD, so it’s important to eat a
balanced diet
to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need.
Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid.
The damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen – a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet.
Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals.
Your GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian.
In the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach.
Medication for symptoms
The use of medication to directly treat ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued there’s limited evidence for its effectiveness.
For people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition.
Nutritional support is also an important part of treatment in these cases.
Other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include:
anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication)
ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat
overactive thyroid glands
)
However, there’s a lack of good evidence that these help and they’re no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis.
Liver transplants
In the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. A
liver transplant
is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure.
A liver transplant may be considered if:
you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol
you’re otherwise well enough to survive such an operation
you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life
Complications of alcohol-related liver disease
A number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD).
Portal hypertension and varices
Portal hypertension is a common complication of
cirrhosis
and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. It occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level.
When the liver becomes severely scarred, it’s harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines.
The blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices.
If the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed.
This can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to
anaemia
.
Alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.
Split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.
Ascites
A person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites.
Initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under
local anaesthetic
.
One of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.
Hepatic encephalopathy
One of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy.
Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:
agitation
confusion
disorientation
muscle stiffness
muscle tremors
difficulty speaking
in very serious cases, a
coma
Hepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood.
Liver cancer
Liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing
liver cancer
.
Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of
alcohol misuse
. It’s estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with
cirrhosis
will develop liver cancer."

About acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.
Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:
lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections
neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage
These pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
chronic myeloid leukaemia
acute myeloid leukaemia
Warning signs of acute leukaemia
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. Symptoms include:
pale skin
tiredness
breathlessness
having repeated infections over a short space of time
unusual and frequent bleeding
Read more about the
symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
What happens in acute leukaemia
All of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow – a spongy material found inside bones.
Bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:
red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body
white blood cells, which help fight infection
platelets, which help stop bleeding
The bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells.
As the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding.
Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.
Despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children.
The cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include:
exposure to high levels of radiation
exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes
Read more information about the
causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.
Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:
pale skin
feeling tired and breathless
having repeated infections over a short space of time
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
night sweats
bone and joint pain
easily bruised skin
swollen lymph nodes (glands)
abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen
unexplained weight loss
a purple skin rash (purpura)
In some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:
headaches
seizures (fits)
vomiting
blurred vision
dizziness
When to seek medical advice
If you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause.
However, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.
Causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced.
The white blood cells are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells.
As the number of immature cells increases, the number of healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this fall which causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.
It is not known exactly what causes this DNA mutation to occur, but there are a few factors which may increase the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
Risk factors
Genetic disorders
A small number of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. For example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children with
Down’s syndrome
.
Radiation exposure
Exposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. However, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl.
Due to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such as
X-rays
, are rarely used on pregnant women.
Most cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation.
Possible environmental factors
Experts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia:
living near a nuclear power station
living near a power line
living near a building or facility that releases electromagnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast
At the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increase the risk of developing leukaemia.
Benzene
Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. However, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.
Benzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. People who have had
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
to treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia.
Other risk factors
There is some evidence to show an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in people who:
are
obese
have a weakened immune system – due to
HIV or AIDS
or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant
Diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
The first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your GP to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample.
A high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).
Bone marrow biopsy
To confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope.
The haematologist will use a
local anaesthetic
to numb the skin over a bone – usually the hip bone – and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight.
The bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and – if found – the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time.
Further tests
There are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These tests are described below.
Cytogenetic testing
Cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.
Immunophenotyping
Immunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied.
This testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.
The blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.
Lymph node biopsy
If you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread.
CT scans
If you have acute leukaemia, a
computerised tomography scan (CT scan)
may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.
Chest X-ray
An
X-ray
may be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes.
Lumbar puncture
If it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, a
lumbar puncture
may be carried out.
A lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. The fluid is tested to determine whether the leukaemia has reached your nervous system.
Treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it’s an aggressive condition that develops rapidly.
Stages of treatment
Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages:
induction – the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood and resolve any symptoms you may have
consolidation – this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system
maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning
Maintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it’s not usually used in the treatment of
acute myeloid leukaemia
.
Induction
The induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. This is because you will probably need to have regular
blood transfusions
as it’s likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells.
You will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed
antibiotics
to help prevent further infection.
Chemotherapy
You will be given
chemotherapy
to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube into a vein in your chest (called a central line).
Some chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to a
lumbar puncture
.
Side effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. They can include:
nausea
vomiting
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
mouth ulcers
tiredness
skin rashes
infertility
hair loss
The side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back.
Steroid therapy
You may also be given
corticosteroid
injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
Imatinib
If you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells.
Imatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include:
nausea
vomiting
swelling in the face and lower legs
muscle cramps
rash
diarrhoea
Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. In some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.
Consolidation
Leukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. Therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed.
Treatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. This is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.
The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.
Maintenance
The maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. It involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving.
The maintenance phase can often last for two years.
Other treatments
As well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. These are described below.
Dasatinib
Dasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful.
Dasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells.
Dasatinib cannot cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not yet made a decision about whether the NHS should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This means it will be at the discretion of your local clinical commissioning group as to whether you will be offered the drug.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia:
to sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain
to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below)
Side effects of both types of radiotherapy include:
hair loss
nausea
fatigue
The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. However, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after the treatment has finished. If this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months.
Many younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty.
A small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery.
Read more about
cataracts
Bone marrow and stem cell transplants
If you or your child do not respond to chemotherapy, a possible alternative treatment option is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.
Transplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister.
Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.
This can put a big strain on the body so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.
Read about
bone marrow transplantation
for more information
Complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia.
There are 2 reasons for this:
the lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection
many of the medicines used to treat acute leukaemia can weaken the immune system
This means that you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.
You may be advised to take regular doses of
antibiotics
to prevent infections occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.
Symptoms of infection include:
high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above
headache
aching muscles
diarrhoea
tiredness
Avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower.
While it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.
Also ensure that all of your
vaccinations
are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as:
the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine
the polio vaccine
the oral typhoid vaccine
the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)
the yellow fever vaccine
Bleeding
If you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur.
Bleeding can occur:
inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage)
inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage)
inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage)
The symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include:
severe headache
stiff neck
vomiting
change in mental state, such as confusion
The most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are:
coughing up blood from your nose and mouth
breathing difficulties
a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)
The 2 most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are:
vomiting blood
passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like
All 3 types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. Phone 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage.
Infertility
Many of the treatments that are used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. Infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent.
People who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.
It may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have samples of their sperm stored. Similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb following treatment.

infertility
Psychological effects of leukaemia
Receiving a diagnosis of leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.
The situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of
stress, anxiety and depression
.
If you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.
You may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/allergic-rhinitis/,"Allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the inside of the nose. It’s caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals.
It’s a very common condition. For most people it’s easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist.
Symptoms of allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis usually causes
cold-like symptoms
, such as:
sneezing
itchiness
a blocked or runny nose
These symptoms usually start soon after coming into contact with something you’re allergic to.
Some people only get allergic rhinitis seasonally because they’re allergic to things like tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
you have allergic rhinitis and your symptoms get worse
you also have asthma and it’s getting worse
your symptoms are affecting your sleep and everyday life
you’re not sure what’s causing your symptoms
treatments from a pharmacist are not working
Diagnosing allergic rhinitis
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and any triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing.
Treatment for allergic rhinitis
Treatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
If you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.
Do
take over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines
clean your nasal passages with a salt water solution
avoid triggers if you can
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child,
speak to a pharmacist
for advice.
How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution
Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool.
Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water.
Wash your hands.
Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it.
Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat.
Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day until your nose feels more comfortable.
You do not need to use all of the solution, but make a fresh solution each time you clean your nose.
Medication
Medication won’t cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the symptoms.
Speak to your GP practice if your symptoms do not improve 2 weeks after starting medicine. They may prescribe a stronger medication such as a nasal spray containing
corticosteroids

What causes allergic rhinitis?
Allergic rhinitis is caused by breathing in tiny particles that you’re allergic to. The most common allergens in the air that cause rhinitis are:
house dust mites
pollen and spores
flakes of animal skin
wood dust
flour dust
latex
You’re more likely to develop an allergy if there’s a history of allergies in your family.
Complications of allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include:
nasal polyps – abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) growths inside the nose and sinuses
sinusitis
– inflammation that blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual
blockage of the middle ear – due to a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum
These problems can often be treated with medication. Surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases."

Anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.
Generalised anxiety disorder
GAD is a long-term condition. It causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of issues, rather than 1 specific event.
People with GAD feel anxious most days. They often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.
As soon as 1 anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue.
Speak to your GP if anxiety is:
affecting your daily life
causing you distress
Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions.
Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a job interview.
During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.
But some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and often affect their daily lives.
Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including:
panic disorder
phobias
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
social anxiety disorder (social phobia)
The information on this page is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).
Symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder
GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things. It can also cause physical changes. This results in symptoms like:
restlessness
a sense of dread
feeling constantly “on edge”
difficulty concentrating
irritability
dizziness
tiredness
a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (
palpitations
)
muscle aches and tension
trembling or shaking
dry mouth
excessive sweating
shortness of breath
stomach ache
feeling sick
headache
pins and needles
difficulty falling or staying asleep (
insomnia
)
Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact to avoid feelings of worry and dread.
You may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.
Anxiety triggers
If you’re anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of
panic disorder
, you’ll usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.
However, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you’re feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it. You may start to worry that there’ll be no solution.
Causes of generalised anxiety disorder
The exact cause of GAD is not fully understood. It’s likely that a combination of several factors plays a role, like:
overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour
an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood
the genes you inherit from your parents – you’re estimated to be 5 times more likely to develop GAD if a close relative has it
having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, like domestic violence, child abuse or bullying
having a painful long-term health condition, like
arthritis
having a history of drug or
alcohol misuse
However, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason.
Treating generalised anxiety disorder
GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life. There are several different treatments are available that can help. These include:
talking therapies – like
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
medication – like a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, like:
trying a self-help course
exercising regularly
stopping smoking
cutting down on
alcohol
drinking less caffeine
With treatment, many people are able to control their levels of anxiety. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time. There may be periods where your symptoms worsen.
Self help for anxiety

Contact support groups
Support groups can give you useful advice about how to effectively manage your anxiety. They’re also a good way to meet other people with similar experiences.
Examples of support groups you may find useful include:
Anxiety UK
Mind
Rethink Mental Illness
Support groups can often arrange face-to-face meetings, where you can talk about your feelings with other people. Many support groups also provide support and guidance over the phone or in writing.
Ask your GP about local support groups for anxiety in your area. Or search our support service directory for mental health information and support services near you.
Referral to a specialist
If treatments you’ve tried aren’t helping, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist.
You’ll usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including:
psychiatrists
psychiatric nurses
clinical psychologists
occupational therapists
social workers
A mental health specialist from your local team will carry out a reassessment of your condition. They’ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it.
Your specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you.
As part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you’ve not tried before. Or you may be offered a combination of a psychological treatment with medication."

About ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed.
The symptoms of AS can vary but usually involve:
back pain and stiffness that improves with exercise and isn’t relieved by rest
pain and swelling in other parts of the body, such as the hips, knees and ribs
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time.
In some people, the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse.
Read more about the
symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis
When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.
If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.

What causes ankylosing spondylitis?
In AS, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed.
As well as causing pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). This fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis.
It is not known what causes the condition, but there is thought to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27.
Read more about the
causes of ankylosing spondylitis
.
Who is affected
AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45.
AS is around three times more common in men than in women.
There are around 200,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with the condition.
How ankylosing spondylitis is treated
There is no cure for AS and it is not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression.
In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of:
exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness
physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility
medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation – such as painkillers and a type of medicine called anti-TNF medication
Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon.
Read more about
treating ankylosing spondylitis
.
Outlook
The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people, the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others the condition can get progressively worse over time.
Around 70-90% of people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However, some people eventually become severely disabled due to the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees.
With modern treatments, AS doesn’t normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems.
For example, AS can lead to
osteoporosis
(weakening of the bones), spinal fractures and
cardiovascular disease
(a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels).

Information about you
If you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis
The symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can vary from person to person, but usually develop slowly, over several months or years.
AS usually first starts to develop during later teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms may come and go, and improve or get worse over many years.
Main symptoms
The main symptoms of AS are described below, although you may not develop all of these if you have the condition.
Back pain and stiffness
Back pain and stiffness are usually the main symptoms of AS. You may find:
the pain gets better with exercise but doesn’t improve, or gets worse, with rest
the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night – you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain
you have pain in the area around your buttocks
Arthritis
As well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, AS can also cause inflammation of the joints (
arthritis
) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. The main symptoms associated with arthritis are:
pain on moving the affected joint
tenderness when the affected joint is examined
swelling and warmth in the affected area
Enthesitis
Enthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones).
Common sites for enthesitis are:
at the top of the shin bone
behind the heel (Achilles tendon)
under the heel
where the ribs join to the breast bone
If your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply.
Fatigue
Fatigue is a common symptom of untreated AS. It can make you feel tired and lacking in energy.
When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.
If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.

Causes of ankylosing spondylitis
In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the vertebrae (bones in the spine) and spinal joints.
Over time, this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone, which in some cases can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility. This is known as ankylosis.
It is not known exactly what causes AS, but in many cases there seems to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27.
HLA-B27 gene
Research has shown that more than 9 out of 10 people with AS carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27).
Having this gene does not necessarily mean you will develop AS. It is estimated that 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the HLA-B27 gene, but most do not have AS.
It is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing AS, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors – although it is not known what these are.
Testing for this gene may be carried out if AS is suspected. However, this test is not a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the HLA-B27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis.
Read about
how ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed
.
Can ankylosing spondylitis be inherited?
AS can run in families, and the HLA-B27 gene can be inherited from another family member.
If you have AS and tests have shown you carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. If you have AS but don’t carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%.
If you have a close relative who has AS, such as a parent or a sibling (brother or sister), you are three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who does not have a relative with the condition.
Diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can be difficult to diagnose because the condition develops slowly and there is no definitive test to confirm a diagnosis.
The first thing you should do if you think you have AS is to see your GP. They will ask about your symptoms, including what symptoms you are experiencing, when they started and how long you have had them.
Back pain associated with AS can be quite distinctive. For example, it usually doesn’t improve with rest and may wake you up during the night.
Blood tests
If your GP suspects AS, they may arrange
blood tests
to check for signs of inflammation in your body. Inflammation in your spine and joints is one of the main symptoms of the condition.
If your results suggest you do have inflammation, you will be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. A rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints.
Further tests
Your rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. These are described below.
X-rays
An
X-ray
of your lower back can show damage to the joints at the base of your spine (the sacroiliac joints) and new bone forming between the vertebrae (bones in your spine), which are common signs of advanced AS.
MRI scan
A
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
may highlight changes in your sacroiliac joints that might not show up on an X-ray. It may also show any inflammation of ligaments in the spinal region.
Ultrasound scan
An
ultrasound scan
can pick up inflammation of the tissues (tendons and ligaments) attached to your bones.
Genetic testing
A genetic blood test may sometimes be carried out to see if you carry the HLA-B27 gene, which is found in most people with AS.
This can contribute towards a diagnosis of AS, but it is not entirely reliable as not everyone with the condition has this gene, and some people have the gene without ever developing AS.
Confirming ankylosing spondylitis
Although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of AS.
This is why diagnosis is often difficult. In many cases, confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years.
A diagnosis of AS can usually be confirmed if an X-ray shows sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) and you have at least one of the following:
at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn’t improve with rest
limited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back)
limited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sex
If you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis – or if you only have sacroiliitis – you will be diagnosed with “probable ankylosing spondylitis”.
Treating ankylosing spondylitis
There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms.
Treatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine fusing (joining up) and stiffening.
In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of exercise, physiotherapy and medication, which are described below.
Physiotherapy and exercise
Keeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful.
As well as keeping active, physiotherapy is a key part of treating AS. A physiotherapist (a healthcare professional trained in using physical methods of treatment) can advise about the most effective exercises and draw up an exercise programme that suits you.
Types of physiotherapy recommended for AS include:
a group exercise programme – where you exercise with others
an individual exercise programme – you are given exercises to do by yourself
massage – your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with AS)
hydrotherapy – exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the buoyancy of the water helps make movement easier by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles
Some people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important.
If you’re ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise.
The
National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS)
provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.
Painkillers
You may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
The first type of painkiller usually prescribed is a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
. As well as helping to ease pain, NSAIDs can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints.
Examples of NSAIDs include
ibuprofen
, naproxen and diclofenac.
When prescribing NSAIDs, your GP or rheumatologist will try to find the one that suits you, and the lowest possible dose that relieves your symptoms. Your dose will be monitored and reviewed as necessary.
Paracetamol
If NSAIDs are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such as
paracetamol
, may be recommended.
Paracetamol rarely causes side effects and can be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, paracetamol may not be suitable for people with liver problems or those dependent on alcohol.
Codeine
If necessary, as well as paracetamol, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine.
Codeine can cause side effects including feeling sick, vomiting,
constipation
and drowsiness.
Anti-TNF medication
If your symptoms cannot be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) medication may be recommended. TNF is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed.
Anti-TNF medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of TNF, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis.
Examples of anti-TNF medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab.
These are relatively new treatments for AS, and their long-term effects are unknown.
However, they have been used for longer in people with
rheumatoid arthritis
, and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety.
If your rheumatologist recommends using anti-TNF medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. This is because anti-TNF medication can interfere with the immune system (the body’s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections.
NICE guidelines
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance about the use of anti-TNF medication for AS. NICE states that adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if:
your
diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis
has been confirmed
your level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved
your
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
is tested twice, 12 weeks apart, and confirms your condition has not improved – BASDAI is a set of measures devised by experts to evaluate your condition, by asking a number of questions about your symptoms
treatment with two or more NSAIDs for four weeks at the highest possible dose has not controlled your symptoms
After 12 weeks of treatment with anti-TNF medication, your pain score and BASDAI will be tested again to see whether they have improved enough to make continuing treatment worthwhile. If they have, treatment will continue and you will be tested every 12 weeks.
If there is not enough improvement after 12 weeks, you will be tested again at a later date or the treatment will be stopped.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids
have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with AS.
If a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. After the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours.
It is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. This is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as:
infection in response to the injection
the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation)
the surrounding tissue may waste away
a tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst)
Corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis.
DMARDs may be prescribed for AS, although they are only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine.
Two DMARDs sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate.
Surgery
Most people with AS will not need surgery.
However, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged, joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. For example, if the hip joints are affected, a
hip replacement
may be carried out.
In rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed if the spine becomes badly bent.
Follow-up
As the symptoms of AS develop slowly and tend to come and go, you will need to see your rheumatologist or GP for regular check-ups.
They will make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. This may involve further sets of the same blood tests or X-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis.
Any
complications of ankylosing spondylitis
that arise will be treated as they develop.
Complications of ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions.
Some complications associated with AS are outlined below.
Reduced flexibility
Although most people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, around 4 in every 10 people with the condition will eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine.
This usually only affects the lower back and is the result of the bones in the spine fusing (joining up).
Fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your posture becomes fixed in one position, although it doesn’t lead to severe disability in most cases.
In rare cases, surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine.
Joint damage
AS can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed. This can damage the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move.
If a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one.
Iritis
Iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with AS where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. It usually only affects one eye, rather than both.
If you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). Your vision may also become blurred or cloudy.
You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly.
If your GP thinks you have iritis, they will refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems) for treatment.
Iritis can usually be treated with
corticosteroid
eye drops.
Osteoporosis and spinal fractures
Osteoporosis
is where the bones become weak and brittle. In AS, osteoporosis can develop in the spine and can increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone. The longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases.
If you do develop osteoporosis, you will usually need to take medication to help strengthen your bones. There are a number of medications that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection.
Read more about
treating osteoporosis
.
Cardiovascular disease
If you have AS, you may also have an increased risk of developing
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
. CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as
heart disease
and
stroke
.
Due to this increased risk, it is important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing CVD.
Your rheumatologist (a specialist in treating muscle and joint conditions) can advise about lifestyle changes you should make to minimise your risk of developing a CVD. These changes may include:
stopping smoking
– if you smoke
losing weight
– if you are overweight or obese
taking regular exercise
– 150 minutes of exercise per week can greatly increase your health
making changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control – such as
diabetes
or
high blood pressure
You may also be prescribed medication to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level.
Cauda equina syndrome
Cauda equina syndrome is a very rare complication of AS that occurs when nerves at the bottom of your spine become compressed (compacted).
Cauda equina syndrome causes:
pain or numbness in your lower back and buttocks
weakness in your legs – which can affect your ability to walk
urinary incontinence
or bowel incontinence (when you cannot control your bladder or bowels)
See your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and you develop any of these symptoms.
Amyloidosis
In very rare cases, it is possible to develop a condition called amyloidosis as a complication of AS.
Amyloid is a protein produced by cells in your bone marrow (the spongy material found in the centres of some hollow bones). Amyloidosis is a condition where amyloid builds up in organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver.
Amyloidosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, fluid retention (oedema),
shortness of breath
and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.
Problems with employment
Over time, AS can increasingly affect your ability to work. Some people with the condition may be unable to work at all and others may need changes to their working life, such as working part-time, working from home or avoiding physically demanding work.
When at work, it is important to maintain a good posture when sitting or standing for long periods of time. You should get up, stretch and move around regularly. This could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks."

Introduction
Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow
Tests for ALL
Treating ALL
Introduction
This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia.
If you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, please see our general
ALL
section.
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:
help fight infection (white cells)
carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells)
stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)
Symptoms
Many of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:
looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)
bruises – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal
infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection
aches and pains in your bones
swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin
feeling unwell and run down
fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection
headaches and visual disturbance
There can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should speak to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.
Causes
It’s not known exactly what causes ALL. Research is going on to try to find out.
Young people with some genetic conditions, such as
Down’s syndrome
or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with.
If you’re worried about ALL
If you think you have some of the symptoms of ALL you should speak to your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any
tests
they think you might need.
Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow
To understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.
All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.
There are 3 main types of blood cells:
white blood cells – which help fight infection
red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body
platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding
The bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).
The main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.
Once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.
How leukaemia develops
In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.
They build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.
Types of leukaemia
Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from two types of blood cells:
lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes
myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils
Leukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:
acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts
There are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.
The information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contact
Macmillan

Tests for ALL
It’s important to remember that the symptoms of ALL can be caused by lots of different things. But you should go to your GP if you’re worried. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any tests they think you might need.
Visiting your GP
Your GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need a blood test to help diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). If you have ALL, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.
This specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood problems.
At the hospital
The haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:
blood tests
– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you
bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing
lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells
chest
X-ray
– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest
If you have ALL, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, or an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart).
This may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.
Waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a Macmillan
cancer support specialist
on their free helpline.

Treating ALL
The main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is
chemotherapy
. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You’ll also have drugs called
steroids
, which help the chemotherapy to work.
The treatment for ALL is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you’ll be in close contact with the hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell and the staff will be able to help if things get tough. Don’t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you are feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines that can help you feel better.
ALL is treated in 3 phases:
getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction
keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy
keeping the leukaemia away long-term – continuing or maintenance therapy
You usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have ALL.
You’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with. If you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenagers and young adults (TYA). If you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.
You’ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). You’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can’t hide there. This is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy. It’s also known as intrathecal therapy.
You’ll have a ‘line’ put in to one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous treatment. Your nurses and doctors can also use the line to take blood samples for blood tests. There are different kinds of lines.
Having chemotherapy can be hard. But the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you’ll be given medicines to stop you feeling sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.
There will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.
Being in hospital or coming up to hospital for clinics and treatment can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work, or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. It can also help to talk to any new friends you’ve made who are going through similar experiences to you.
We have more information about
chemotherapy
that has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults.
Getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)
The first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.
This type of treatment involves:
chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including CNS therapy)
steroids to help the chemotherapy work
drugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once
another tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcers
You need to stay in hospital during this phase of your treatment so the doctors can check how things are going.
Treatment to get you into remission takes about 5 weeks, sometimes a bit longer. Being in hospital that long can be really difficult at times. If you’re struggling to cope, try and talk to your friends, family, doctors and nurses. It’s important not to bottle up your feelings otherwise your might end up finding it hard to cope. Drugs you may be given include:
vincristine
asparaginase
daunorubicin
mercaptopurine
methotrexate
Side effects
Different chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s
chemotherapy section
.
Central nervous system therapy
Chemotherapy given as tablets or into the blood can reach most places in your body. But it isn’t good at getting into the brain or spinal cord (called the central nervous system or CNS). So you’ll be given treatment into the fluid that goes around the CNS to target any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This is called CNS therapy.
CNS therapy is given during remission induction treatment (to get rid of the leukaemia) and continues right until the end of maintenance therapy.
Chemotherapy is given into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around your spinal cord. Drug treatment given into the CSF is called intrathecal therapy.
It’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.
The chemotherapy drug used for CNS therapy is called methotrexate.
Side effects
Most people don’t have side effects after having intrathecal methotrexate. But occasionally it can cause headaches, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours. Rarely other side effects like seizures (fits), weakness of your arms or legs and changes in how awake you are can happen. But these almost always go away completely and you can still have the intrathecal injections in the future.
Keeping leukaemia away
This treatment is called consolidation and delayed intensification therapy. When you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples when they check them under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so you need further treatment to get rid of these cells.
You’ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. This is so the leukaemia cells don’t have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance).
This phase of treatment takes about 5 to 6 months. Most of the treatment can be given as an outpatient but you might need to stay in hospital for some parts of it.
Drugs you may be given include:
cyclophosphamide
cytarabine (ara-C)
mercaptopurine
methotrexate
vincristine
asparaginase
doxorubicin
Side effects
Chemotherapy does cause side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s
chemotherapy section
.
Keeping the leukaemia away long term (maintenance therapy)
This treatment is given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as relapse). The chemotherapy is given in low doses. You have it as an outpatient so you can keep doing all your normal, everyday activities when you’re having maintenance therapy.
Maintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles.
You’ll have:
mercaptopurine tablets each day
methotrexate tablets once a week
steroid tablets for 5 days every 4 weeks
vincristine chemotherapy every 4 weeks
methotrexate chemotherapy into your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) every 12 weeks
At the moment, boys have just over 3 years of maintenance therapy and girls have just over 2 years. This is because it takes a bit longer in boys to get rid of any remaining leukaemia cells.
During this time, you’ll have regular check-ups – usually every week or two – to check if your drug doses need to be adjusted and to make sure you’re OK. Very often, things like blood tests can be done at your GP practice or at home by a district nurse. Ask your doctor or nurse about arranging this."

About anaphylaxis
Causes of anaphylaxis

Preventing anaphylaxis
About anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly.
It is also known as anaphylactic shock.
Signs of anaphylaxis include:
itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash
swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet
feeling lightheaded or faint
swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties
wheezing
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
collapse and unconsciousness
What to do
Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline should be given as soon as possible.
Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline.
This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device.
You should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not.
If after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh.
A second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again.
The person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.
If the person is unconscious, you should move them to the recovery position – on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person’s breathing or heart stops,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
should be performed.
Further treatment will be carried out in hospital.

Causes and triggers
Anaphylaxis is the result of your body’s immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens.
Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4 hours later.
The most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are:
insect stings
– particularly wasp and bee stings
peanuts and tree nuts
other types of foods – such as milk and seafood
certain medicines – such as
antibiotics
Read more about the
causes of anaphylaxis
.
Preventing further episodes
If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it’s important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers.
You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future.
You may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis.
Read more about
preventing anaphylaxis
.
Who is affected?
Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as
asthma
or the allergic skin condition
atopic eczema
, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis.
Although the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.
Causes of anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection.
In the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat.
Triggers
Some of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below.
Insect stings
Most cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis.
It’s estimated around 1 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis.
Foods
More than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts.
Other foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include:
nuts – such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts
milk
fish and shellfish
eggs
some types of fruit – such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries
Medicines
Medicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include:
antibiotics
– particularly penicillin-like antibiotics
general anaesthetic
– muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
– a type of painkiller that includes
ibuprofen
and aspirin
People sensitive to these types of medicines will usually develop anaphylaxis as soon as they begin a course of treatment, although they may have safely received them in the past.
The risk of anaphylaxis using these types of medicines is very small, so in most cases the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk.
For example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around:
1 in 1,480 after taking a NSAID-type painkiller
1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin
1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaesthetic
Contrast agents
Contrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such as
X-rays
.
For example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the X-ray. This is known as
angiography
.
The risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than 1 in 10,000.
Rubber latex
Less than 1 in 100 people in the population has a natural rubber latex allergy. Healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy.
Those with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected.
Idiopathic anaphylaxis
Sometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.
Treating anaphylaxis
If you think somebody is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should use an adrenaline injector if one is available. Dial 999 immediately afterwards.
Call 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available.
If you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it.
Adrenaline injections
Adrenaline causes the blood vessels to become narrower, which raises your blood pressure and reduces swelling. It also causes the airways to open, relieving breathing difficulties.
An adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected.
The signs of suspected anaphylaxis are:
problems breathing
feeling faint or dizzy
loss of consciousness
The injection can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes – if it’s a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example – another person may need to do it.
Before attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. You should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector.
After injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Injections can be given through clothing.
After injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better.
Most people should experience a rapid improvement in symptoms once the adrenaline has been used.
If there’s no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. This should be injected into the opposite thigh.
Read
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2014 guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (PDF, 188kb)
.
Positioning and resuscitation
In most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart.
Pregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart.
If the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.
If the person is unconscious, check that their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. Then put them in the
recovery position
to make sure they don’t choke on their vomit.
Place the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.
If the person’s breathing or heart stops,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
should be performed.
Admission to hospital
Even if adrenaline is given, the person will need to go to hospital for observation – usually for 6 to 12 hours – as symptoms can occasionally return during this period.
While in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure.
As well as adrenaline, additional medications such as antihistamines and
corticosteroids
can be used to help relieve symptoms.
Blood tests
may also be carried out while you’re in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis.
You should be able to leave hospital when the symptoms are under control and it’s thought they will not return quickly. This may be after a few hours, but you may have to stay in hospital for a few days if the symptoms were severe.
You may be asked to take antihistamines and corticosteroid tablets 2 to 3 days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning.
You will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.
An adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment.

Preventing anaphylaxis
If you have anaphylaxis, you should be offered advice and medication to help prevent further episodes.
Allergy clinic
You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic for tests to find out what caused the anaphylaxis. Knowing what allergen triggered the allergic reaction can help you avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.
Some of the tests commonly used to determine allergies include:
a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts by becoming red, raised and itchy
a blood test – a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergen
Read more about
diagnosing allergies
.
Adrenaline auto-injectors
You may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if you’ve had a previous episode of anaphylaxis and there’s a risk of you having another episode in the future.
There are 3 types of auto-injector:
EpiPen
Jext
Emerade
Each type is slightly different, and you should make sure you know how to use your auto-injector correctly.
You can also ask for a “trainer” kit so you can practise giving yourself or your child injections.
The following points are important:
Carry your auto-injector(s) at all times – there should be no exceptions. It may also be recommended that you get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor’s contact details to alert others.
Extremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective, so don’t leave your auto-injector in the fridge or your car’s glove compartment.
Check the expiry date regularly. An out-of-date injector will offer limited protection.
The manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information.
If your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately 4.5 stone).
Don’t delay injecting yourself if you think you may be experiencing the beginning of anaphylaxis, even if your initial symptoms are mild. It’s better to use adrenaline early and then find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you’re sure you are experiencing severe anaphylaxis.
Avoid triggers
If a trigger has been identified as causing your episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to take steps to avoid it in the future.
Food
You can reduce the chances of being exposed to a food allergen by:
checking food labels
letting staff at a restaurant know what you’re allergic to, so it’s not included in your meal
remembering that some types of food may contain small traces of potential allergens – for example, some sauces contain wheat and peanuts
See our page on
living with a food allergy
for more information.
Insect stings
You can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as:
moving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking – don’t wave your arms around or swat at them
using an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summer
Some specialist allergy centres also offer special treatment to help desensitise you to insect stings if you are at a particularly high risk of a further sting – for example, if you are a beekeeper or gardener.
Read more about
preventing insect stings
.
Medicines
If you’re allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. For example, if you’re allergic to:
penicillin – you can normally safely take a different group of
antibiotics
known as macrolides
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as
ibuprofen
and aspirin – you can normally safely take
paracetamol
, but read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don’t contain NSAIDs
one type of
general anaesthetic
– others are available, or it may be possible to perform surgery using a
local anaesthetic
or an epidural injection
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – alternative blood pressure medications, such as calcium channel blockers, can be used
Always tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them.
Contrast agents
There may be times when it’s necessary to use contrast agents – for example, if you had bleeding inside your brain – even if this places you at risk of anaphylaxis.
In such circumstances, you can be given injections of antihistamines and
corticosteroids
before the contrast agents, which may help prevent symptoms occurring or at least make them less severe."

About angioedema
Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid.
The symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but swelling usually affects the:
eyes
lips
genitals
hands
feet
Many people with angioedema also experience
urticaria (hives)
. This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin.
Angioedema can cause swelling in any part of the body, including the lips.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Angioedema can cause swelling around the eye.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Why does angioedema happen?
The cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4 main types of angioedema:
allergic angioedema – the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with
anaphylaxis
idiopathic angioedema – there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms)
drug-induced angioedema – the swelling is a side effect of certain medications, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
hereditary angioedema – the swelling is caused by “faulty” genes that are inherited from a person’s parents
Read more about the
causes of angioedema
.
Who is affected
Angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although some types are more common than others.
Hereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.
Diagnosis
Your doctor can diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and discussing symptoms.
However, further tests, such as
blood tests
or allergy tests, may be required to determine the type of angioedema.
Idiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found.
Read more about
diagnosing angioedema
.
How is angioedema treated?
Although most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used.
For cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and
oral steroids (steroid tablets)
can be used to relieve the swelling.
Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have.
Although the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema.
Read more about
treating angioedema
.
Symptoms of angioedema
The main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin’s surface.
Swollen skin
The swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.
It most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).
The swelling usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1 to 3 days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.
The swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop
urticaria (hives)
, which is red and itchy.
Swelling caused by angioedema often affects the hands and feet.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Other symptoms
As well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including:
a hot or painful sensation in the swollen areas
swelling of the inside of the throat, the windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult
swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects vision
People with hereditary angioedema may also experience:
abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea
swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.
When to seek emergency medical advice
Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing
anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)
. Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.
Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis include:
a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to breathing problems
swelling of the tongue and throat
If you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.
Causes of angioedema
Angioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified.
Allergic angioedema
Normally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body.
In allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. Your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin.
Substances known to trigger allergic angioedema include:
certain types of food – particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs
some types of medication – such as penicillin, aspirin and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as ibuprofen
insect bites and stings
– particularly wasp and bee stings
latex – a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and
condoms
Idiopathic angioedema
Cases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. It may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to “misfire”.
In cases of idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as:
anxiety or stress
minor infections
hot or cold temperatures
exercise
Avoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms.
Drug-induced angioedema
Some medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat
high blood pressure (hypertension)
, are usually responsible.
It’s estimated that around 1-5% of people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop this side effect than white people.
Around 1 in 4 cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins.
While they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the “chemical balance” and trigger an episode of severe swelling.
Less common causes of drug-induced angioedema include:
bupropion – a medication that helps people to
give up smoking
vaccines
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
– a type of antidepressant
COX-II inhibitors – a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as
arthritis
NSAIDs – a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or
ibuprofen
angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists – another medication used to treat high blood pressure
statins
– used to treat people with
high cholesterol levels
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – used to treat
stomach ulcers
Hereditary angioedema
Hereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour.
As a result of the mutated C1-inh gene, the body does not make enough C1-inh protein. This protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Without enough C1-inh protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema.
Certain things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as:
trauma – including surgery or infection
the oral contraceptive pill
pregnancy
The mutated C1-inh gene is passed down through families. If you have hereditary angioedema, you have a 50% chance of passing it on to your children.
Diagnosing angioedema
Angioedema is usually diagnosed by your doctor examining the affected skin and discussing your symptoms.
It can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. There is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or blood tests if a specific cause is suspected.
Allergic angioedema
You’re likely to be asked if you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex. You may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such as
urticaria (hives)
or
asthma
. People with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions.
Tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins.
Your GP may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants – or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected.
If allergic angioedema is suspected, you are likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests may include:
a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction
a
blood test
– a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen

.
Drug-induced angioedema
If you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your GP will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. You should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional.
If you don’t have any further episodes of angioedema, a diagnosis of drug-induced angioedema can be made.
Hereditary angioedema
Hereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the C1-inh gene. A very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema.
The diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is highly specialised and should be carried out in a specialist immunology clinic.
Idiopathic angioedema
Idiopathic angioedema is usually confirmed by a “diagnosis of exclusion”. This means a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema can only be made after all the above tests have been carried out and a cause has not been found.
As angioedema can be associated with other medical problems – such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland – your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions.
Treating angioedema
Medication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment.
Allergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and
corticosteroids
to help relieve the swelling.
Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms.
If you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.
Read more about
treating anaphylaxis
.
Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken. A number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell.
A 2-week course of a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended – these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.
Antihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery.
If you also have
urticaria (hives)
and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine to take before going to bed. These types cause drowsiness and should help you sleep.
A minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid:
driving
drinking alcohol
operating complex or heavy machinery
Other side effects of the newer antihistamines include:
headache
dry mouth
dry nose
These side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids (steroids)
work by blocking many of your immune system’s actions. In most cases, a 3 to 5 day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice.
Side effects of prednisolone include:
nausea
abdominal (stomach) pain
tiredness
oral thrush
– a fungal infection inside your mouth
dizziness
If you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. These side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment.
Steroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. These are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system).
Medication for hereditary angioedema
The medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1 of 2 categories:
medication used to prevent angioedema
medication used to relieve symptoms
Danazol
Danazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the C1-inh protein.
However, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause:
weight gain
depression
disruption to the menstrual cycle – such as irregular periods or absent periods
high blood pressure
in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men – such as excessive body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone
liver problems
Due to these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated.
Tranexamic acid
Tranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women.
Icatibant
Icatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema.
Icatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a second injection is often required.
Common side effects of icatibant include:
adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection – such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness
itchiness in other areas of the skin
dizziness
C1-inhibitors
Purified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It’s needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It’s used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein.
Many patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use.
Icatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema."

About angina
Treating angina
About angina
Angina is chest pain which occurs when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted because of narrowing or blockages in the blood vessels around the heart.
Symptoms of angina
The main symptom of angina is chest pain. This can:
feel like a dull pain, ache, ‘heavy’ or ‘tight’ feeling in your chest
spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back
be triggered by physical exertion
Angina itself is not life threatening, but prolonged chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack.
Phone 999 immediately if:
You or someone else has symptoms like:
central chest pain or discomfort in the chest that doesn’t go away – it may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing
pain that radiates down the left arm, or both arms, or to the neck, jaw, back or stomach
unconsciousness
seizures or fitting
difficulty breathing (snoring or rasping)
chest pain alongside breathlessness, nausea and sweating
Speak to your GP if you: test
do not have a diagnosis of angina and experience chest pain on exercise that eases after a few minutes of resting
have an angina diagnosis and your symptoms are becoming more frequent or occur at rest
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Diagnosing angina
To diagnose angina, you will be assessed and you may need to have several tests.
You will also be asked some questions about:
the symptoms you experienced
if there were any triggers for the pain
your family’s medical history
lifestyle risk factors (like smoking, for example)
Tests for angina
You might also be given some tests to determine if you already have heart disease or you’re at risk of it.
measuring your weight
measuring blood pressure
taking blood to check cholesterol levels, diabetes or anaemia
If it’s thought that you have angina, you might be referred to the hospital for some more tests. These might include:
electrocardiogram (ECG)
– measures the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart
exercise tolerance test (ETT) – measures the activity of the heart during exercise
myocardial perfusion scan (MPS or MYoview) – measures how well blood is reaching the heart
coronary angiography
– shows whether your coronary arteries are narrow and how severe any blockages are
blood tests
–
help to identify increased enzyme levels (troponin) which are released when the heart is damaged
Types of angina
The 2 main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina.
Stable angina is more common. Attacks are more likely to have a trigger (like physical activity or stress).
Symptoms of stable angina usually only last for a few minutes after exercise or stress. They can improve with rest and by taking a medication called Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).
Attacks of unstable angina can be unpredictable and develop without any clear triggers. They might also last longer and continue even when resting.
Sometimes, when chest pain occurs suddenly, it’s unclear if it’s due to unstable angina or a heart attack. Until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).
Treating angina
There are various ways to treat and manage angina.
Stable angina
If you have stable angina you may be given medicine to:
prevent and treat angina attacks
reduce your risk of a heart attack
Preventing and treating angina attacks
Nitrates
You may be given nitrates if you have stable angina. These work by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels so that blood can pass through more easily.
You might be given nitrates as:
slow release tablets
a fast acting spray or tablet
Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is usually given in a fast acting spray or tablets. You should keep this with you at all times. If you experience an episode of angina you can use the spray or tablet under your tongue. The pain should then ease within a few minutes.
You can repeat the dose after 5 minutes if the pain has not gone away. If the pain has still not gone 5 minutes after you take the second dose you should call an ambulance.
Beta blockers
Beta blockers work mainly by slowing down the heart.
Calcium channel blockers
Calcium channel blockers relax the arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart muscle.
If you cannot have beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, you may be given another medicine. Your doctor will discuss this with you.
Reducing your risk of a heart attack or stroke
To reduce your risk of more serious cardiovascular problems, your doctor might give you:
a low dose of
aspirin
to prevent blood clots
statins
to reduce your cholesterol (blood fats) level
ACE inhibitors to reduce your blood pressure
Unstable angina
Worsening angina symptoms over a short period of time can be a sign of a more acute coronary syndrome and you should seek urgent medical advice by phoning 999.
If you have unstable angina (where symptoms develop unpredictably), you’ll need certain medicines. These will prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of having a heart attack.
You may be given:
low-dose aspirin
clopidogrel
Ticagrelor
Surgery may be recommended if you continue to have angina attacks despite medical treatment. It may also be recommended if tests show that you’re at a high risk of having a heart attack.
Surgery for angina
There are 2 types of procedures that are used to treat angina. These are a:
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
The best option for you depends on your circumstances. You should discuss the different options with your doctor. It’s likely that you will need to continue taking some medicines after surgery.
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
A CABG is where a section of a blood vessel is taken from another part of the body. This is then used to re-route the flow of blood past a blocked or narrow section of artery.
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
PCI is where a narrowed section of artery is widened using a balloon and a tiny tube called a stent. It’s also known as a coronary angioplasty."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/anorexia-nervosa/,"Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder. It’s a serious, potentially life-threatening, mental health condition.
People who have anorexia are very anxious about their weight and body shape. They try to keep their weight as low as possible by strictly controlling what they eat. Many people with anorexia will also exercise excessively.
They may also use other methods to try to control their weight, like using
laxatives
, vomiting after eating, and taking stimulant drugs.
Symptoms of anorexia
Signs and symptoms of anorexia include:
fear of ‘being fat’ or gaining weight
problems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight
restricting food intake
keeping your body weight low, to the point it’s unhealthy
Restricting your food intake means your body isn’t getting enough energy or nutrition. This can lead to other physical symptoms.
Other signs of anorexia
Eating too little for a long time can cause physical symptoms, like:
fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body
more hair on the face
pubic hair becoming sparse and thin
slow or irregular heartbeat
People with anorexia may also:
have pain in their abdomen (tummy)
feel bloated or
constipated
have swelling in their feet, hands or face
feel very tired
have low blood pressure (
hypotension
)
feel cold or have a low body temperature
feel light-headed or dizzy
In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty. They might be shorter than other people of the same age.
If you get periods and you have anorexia, your periods may stop. Anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women.
Getting help for anorexia
Speak to your GP if you think you have:
an eating problem
anorexia
Beat has more information about treatment for anorexia
Helping someone else with anorexia
If someone close to you is showing signs of anorexia, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
If you’d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:
how to help the person recognise that they have a problem
the treatments available
how you can support them during their treatment
You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders.
Beat has more information about how to support someone with anorexia
Diagnosing anorexia
When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits.
For example, they might:
ask if you’ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly
ask how you feel about your weight, and if you’re concerned about it
ask if you make yourself vomit regularly
check if you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long
check your weight
check your pulse and blood pressure
do a blood test
It’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you. They just need to accurately assess your symptoms.
Referral to a specialist
If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they’ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment. Your GP sometimes carries out this assessment.
Treatment for anorexia
Treatment for anorexia usually involves a combination of:
talking therapy
, and
supervised weight gain
It’s important to start treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of serious complications.
Treatment for anorexia is slightly different for adults and those under 18 years old.
Complications of anorexia
If someone has anorexia for a long time, it can lead to severe complications and health problems. These can sometimes be permanent.
People with anorexia have an increased risk of:
poor circulation and cardiovascular problems
heart conditions, like coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
health problems caused by
malnutrition
– a lack of vitamins and minerals
Anorexia can cause an imbalance of minerals in the blood, like potassium, calcium and sodium. These minerals help keep you healthy. When there’s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like:
tiredness
weakness
dehydration
fits
irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
muscle spasms
confusion
Health conditions
Other conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include:
low blood pressure (
hypotension
)
anaemia
dental problems, like
tooth decay
caused by regular vomiting
low blood sugar levels (
hypoglycaemia
)
acute kidney (renal) failure
liver damage
heart failure
osteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls
loss of sex drive
(libido) and
impotency
in men
Misuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.
Anorexia and pregnancy
Anorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles (periods), or cause your periods to stop altogether. This doesn’t mean anorexia makes you infertile.
If you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.
If you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your GP and care team.
Anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, like:
miscarriage
giving birth early (premature birth)
having a baby with a low birth weight
You’re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and recovered from it."

About arterial thrombosis
Arterial thrombosis is a blood clot that develops in an artery. It’s dangerous as it can obstruct or stop the flow of blood to major organs, such as the heart or brain.
If a blood clot narrows one or more of the arteries leading to the heart, muscle pain known as
angina
can occur.
If a blood clot blocks the arteries leading to part of the heart muscle, it will cause a heart attack. If it blocks an artery in the brain, it will cause a
stroke
.
Symptoms therefore depend on where the blood clot has formed.
Find out more about the symptoms of arterial thrombosis
Who’s at risk of arterial thrombosis?
Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when a process called atherosclerosis damages an artery.
Fatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow.
Find out more about the causes and risk factors for developing arterial thrombosis
Treating arterial thrombosis
There are two main types of treatment for arterial thrombosis.
Medication
Medication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart.
Surgery
Surgery involves a surgeon accessing the affected artery. They will either:
unblock it
re-route the blood flow via another blood vessel
“graft” the blood vessel to travel around, or past, the section that’s blocked
Find out more about the treatment of arterial thrombosis
Preventing arterial thrombosis
If you’ve had a blood clot in an artery, you may need to take medication to prevent it from happening again.
It’s also vital that you live a healthy lifestyle. This includes:
stopping smoking
(if you smoke)
doing some physical activity
reducing the amount of salt and saturated fat that you eat
Find out more about preventing arterial thrombosis
Symptoms of arterial thrombosis
Depending on where the clot is in your body, a bloodclot in an artery (arterial thrombosis) can cause:
angina
heart attack
stroke
peripheral vascular disease
Find out about each of these below.
Heart attack
A heart attack can happen when a blood clot completely blocks an artery that pumps blood to your heart muscle.
You may experience:
a crushing central chest pain or mild chest discomfort
shortness of breath
a clammy, sweaty and grey complexion
dizziness
nausea and vomiting
If you suspect you or someone you know is having a heart attack, dial
999
immediately. It’s important that you don’t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.
Find out more about the symptoms of a heart attack
Stroke
Arterial thrombosis can cause a stroke if a blood clot is blocking an artery that supplies blood to your brain.
The symptoms of a stroke can come on suddenly and may include:
numbness or weakness down one side, ranging in severity from weakness in your hand to complete paralysis of the whole side of your body
weakness in your face, which can make you drool saliva
dizziness
difficulty talking and understanding what others are saying
problems with balance and co-ordination
difficulty swallowing
If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, dial
999
immediately. It’s important that you don’t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.
Further information on a stroke
Peripheral vascular disease
If you have a narrowing of an artery in one or both of your legs (peripheral vascular disease) you may:
be more susceptible to developing a clot
have pain when exercising, usually in the lower half of your legs
have pain that may affect both legs, but develops in one leg before the other
have pale, cold skin and numbness in one of your legs
Peripheral vascular disease can also cause other problems such as impotence (
erectile dysfunction
).
If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to talk to your GP.
If one of your legs is a very different colour from the other, and you have other symptoms, you should treat this as an emergency and call
999
.
Causes of arterial thrombosis
Arterial thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms within an artery, slowing or stopping the flow of blood.
How it happens
Your blood contains cells called platelets and proteins (clotting factors). Together they make up the blood-clotting mechanism.
When a blood vessel is cut, the platelets and clotting factors in your blood mesh together to form a solid clot at the site of the wound. This clot acts as a plug to stop the wound from bleeding.
Normally, the blood-clotting mechanism is triggered when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeds, such as when you cut yourself. However, the blood may sometimes begin to clot even when a blood vessel has not been damaged.
If this happens, a blood clot can form within a vein or artery (thrombosis).
What causes it to happen
Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by atherosclerosis.
Fatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow. The risk factors for a blood clot in an artery include:
eating a high-fat diet
smoking
alcohol misuse
obesity
lack of exercise
diabetes (both
type 1 diabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
)
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
Diagnosing arterial thrombosis
The tests used to diagnose blood clots in the arteries (arterial thrombosis) will depend on what medical condition the blood clot has triggered.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Suspected cases of unstable angina and heart attacks are diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals that will show on paper. This allows your doctor to see how well your heart is functioning or if there are any areas not receiving blood as in a heart attack.
Find out more about
having an ECG
Blood test
Blood may also be taken to measure levels of a protein called troponin. This is released when the heart muscle is damaged by a heart attack.
Find out more about
blood tests
Scans
Suspected cases of stroke are diagnosed by producing a scan of the brain using a
computed tomography (CT) scan
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
Treating arterial thrombosis
There are two main types of treatment for a blood clot that develops in an artery (arterial thrombosis):
medication
surgery
Medication
Medication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart.
Surgery
You may need a heart procedure if the blood clot is in an artery that supplies blood to your heart.
Coronary angioplasty
A coronary angioplasty is the most common type of procedure for a heart attack.
A hollow metal tube called a stent is inserted to widen the artery and stop it from blocking again.
Find out more about
having a coronary angioplasty
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
Occasionally, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may be carried out after a heart attack.
A blood vessel that is taken from another part of the body is used to bypass where the blockage is.
Find out more about
having a CABG
Carotid endarterectomy
Another type of surgery for arterial thrombosis is called carotid endarterectomy, which you may have if you have had a blood clot in an artery in your neck (causing a stroke).
The surgeon makes a cut in your neck to open up the artery and remove the fatty deposits.
Preventing arterial thrombosis
It’s not possible to prevent blood clots altogether, but there are a number of ways to reduce the risks of developing a blood clot in an artery.
Medication
If you’ve had blood clot in an artery before, you might need to take medication to prevent it from happening again.
Medication can include:
statins
– used to lower your blood cholesterol levels
anticoagulant medicines- such as
warfarin
antiplatelet medicines – such as low-dose
aspirin
or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure)
Lifestyle
In addition to medication, it’s vital that you look after your health and take steps to improve your lifestyle.
Most cases of arterial thrombosis are associated with atherosclerosis (the ‘furring up’ of your arteries with fatty deposits). This can lead to a blood clot in an artery and cause a heart attack or stroke.
Making healthy changes to your lifestyle can greatly reduce the effects of this condition, and others such a heart disease.
Things you could do include:
stopping smoking
(if you smoke)
reduce your alcohol intake to recommended limits
reduce salt intake
eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables and 2 portions of fish per week (1 oily)
do a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate exercise such as walking or cycling at least 5 times a week"

About asthma
Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.
The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.
Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an ‘asthma attack’, although doctors sometimes use the term ‘exacerbation’.
Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.
Read more about the
symptoms of asthma
and
diagnosing asthma
What causes asthma?
Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.
When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs – known as a trigger – your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).
Common asthma triggers include:
house dust mites
animal fur
pollen
cigarette smoke
exercise
viral infections
Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.
The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition.
Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people.
Read more about the
causes of asthma
Who is affected?
In the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma.
That’s the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men.
How asthma is treated
While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.
Treatment is based on two important goals, which are:
relieving symptoms
preventing future symptoms and attacks
For most people, this will involve the occasional – or, more commonly, daily – use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.
You should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.
Read more about
treating asthma
and
living with asthma
Outlook
For many people, asthma is a long-term condition – particularly if it first develops in adulthood.
Asthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with long-lasting asthma may develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems.
For children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.
Symptoms of asthma
The symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. Most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time.
The main symptoms of asthma are:
wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)
shortness of breath
a tight chest – which may feel like a band is tightening around it
coughing
These symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. They may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen.
Read our page on the
causes of asthma
for more information about potential triggers.
Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control the symptoms.
Asthma attacks
When asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or ‘acute asthma exacerbation’.
Asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action.
During an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse and – if you’re already on treatment – your inhaler medication may not work as well as it normally does.
You might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. Read about
diagnosing asthma
for more information.
Signs of a particularly severe asthma attack can include:
your reliever inhaler (which is usually blue) is not helping symptoms as much as usual, or at all
wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant
being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep
breathing faster
a rapid heartbeat
feeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy
your lips or fingers turning blue (cyanosis)
Phone 999 to seek immediate help if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe asthma attack.
Causes of asthma
It’s not clear exactly what causes asthma, although it is likely to be a combination of factors.
Some of these may be genetic. However, a number of environmental factors are thought to play a role in the development of asthma. These include air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards (known as the ‘hygiene hypothesis’).
There is currently not enough evidence to be certain whether any of these can cause asthma, although a variety of environmental irritants, such as dust, cold air and smoke, may make it worse.
Who is at risk?
Although the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. These include:
a family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema,
food allergy
or
hay fever
having another atopic condition
having
bronchiolitis
(a common childhood lung infection) as a child
childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy
being born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth
having a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb
Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.
Asthma triggers
In people with asthma, the small tubes (bronchi) that carry air in and out of the lungs become inflamed and more sensitive than normal.
This means that when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs (a trigger), your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).
Asthma symptoms can have a range of triggers, such as:
respiratory tract infections – particularly infections affecting the upper airways, such as
colds
and the
flu
allergens – including pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers
airborne irritants – including cigarette smoke, chemical fumes and atmospheric pollution
medicines – particularly the class of painkillers called
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, which includes
aspirin
and
ibuprofen
, and
beta-blockers
sometimes given for
high blood pressure
or some types of
heart disease
emotions – including stress or laughing
foods containing sulphites – naturally occurring substances found in some food and drinks, such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals
weather conditions – including a sudden change in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms, poor air quality and hot, humid days
indoor conditions – including mould or damp, house dust mites and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials

food allergies
– including allergies to nuts or other food items
Once you know your asthma triggers, you may be able to help control your condition by trying to avoid them.

Occupational asthma
In some cases, asthma is associated with substances you may be exposed to at work. This is known as “occupational asthma”.
Some of the most commonly reported causes of occupational asthma include exposure to:
isocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint)
flour and grain dust
colophony (a substance often found in solder fumes)
latex
animals
wood dust
You may be at an increased risk of developing occupational asthma if you are regularly exposed to substances such as these through your work.
Occupations that are commonly associated with the condition include paint sprayers, bakers and pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, food processing workers and timber workers.

Diagnosing asthma
If you have typical asthma symptoms, your GP will often be able to make a diagnosis.
They will want to know when the symptoms happen and how often, and if you have noticed anything that might trigger them.
Your GP may also ask whether you have any allergic (atopic) conditions such as
eczema
and
hay fever
, which often occur alongside asthma.
A number of tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. These are described below.
In children, asthma can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions can cause similar symptoms in infants. The tests outlined below are also not always suitable for children.
Your GP therefore may sometimes suggest that your child uses an asthma inhaler as a trial treatment. If this helps improve your child’s symptoms, it is likely they have asthma.
Spirometry
A breathing test called spirometry will often be carried out to assess how well your lungs work. This involves taking a deep breath and exhaling as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer.
The spirometer takes two measurements – the volume of air you can breathe out in the first second of exhalation (the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (the forced vital capacity or FVC).
You may be asked to breathe into the spirometer a few times to get an accurate reading.
The readings are then compared with average measurements for people your age, sex and height, which can show if your airways are obstructed.
Sometimes an initial set of measurements is taken, and you are then given a medicine to open up your airways (a reliever inhaler) to see if this improves your breathing when another reading is taken.
This is known as reversibility testing, and it can be useful in distinguishing asthma from other lung conditions, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
.
Peak expiratory flow test
A small hand-held device known as a peak flow meter can be used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. This is your peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the test is usually called a peak flow test.
This test requires a bit of practise to get it right, so your GP or nurse will show you how to do it and may suggest you take the best of two or three readings.
You may be given a peak flow meter to take home and a diary to record measurements of your peak flow over a period of weeks. This is because asthma is variable and your lung function may change throughout the day.
Your diary may also have a space to record your symptoms. This helps to diagnose asthma and, once diagnosed, will help you recognise when your asthma is getting worse and aid decisions about what action to take.
To help diagnose asthma that may be related to your work (occupational asthma), your GP may ask you to take measurements of your peak expiratory flow both at work and when you are away from work. Your GP may then refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis.
Other tests
Some people may also need a number of more specialised tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis of asthma or help diagnose a different condition. This will help you and your doctor to plan your treatment.
Airways responsiveness
This test is sometimes used to diagnose asthma when the diagnosis is not clear from the more simple tests discussed above. It measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger.
You will be asked to breathe in a medication that deliberately irritates or constricts your airways slightly if you have asthma, causing a small decrease in your FEV1 measured using spirometry and possibly triggering mild asthma symptoms. If you do not have asthma, your airways will not respond to this stimulus.
The test often involves inhaling progressively increasing amounts of the medication at intervals, with spirometry measurement of FEV1 in between to see if it falls below a certain threshold. In some cases, however, exercise may be used as a trigger.
Testing airway inflammation
It may also be useful in some cases to carry out tests to check for inflammation in your airways. This can be done in two main ways:
a mucus sample – the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm) so it can be tested for signs of inflammation in the airways
nitric oxide concentration – as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine; a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of airway inflammation
Allergy tests
Skin testing or a
blood test
can be used to confirm whether your asthma is associated with specific allergies, such as dust mites, pollen or foods.
Tests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to certain substances known to cause occupational asthma.

Treating asthma
Reliever inhalers
Reliever inhalers – usually blue – are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly.
The inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again.
Reliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term – they are intended only for the relief of symptoms.
Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused.
However, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed.
Everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a ‘reliever’.
Read further information:
Asthma UK: relievers
Preventer inhalers
Preventer inhalers – usually brown, red or orange – work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring.
They must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control.
You will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed if you continue to need them often.
The preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone.
Preventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week.
Some inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk.
Smoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers.

Asthma UK: preventer inhalers
Other treatments and ‘add-on’ therapy
Long-acting reliever inhalers
If your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team.
If this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or LABA) to take as well.
These work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover.
Regular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours.
However, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. If they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack.
You should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself.
In view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a ‘combination’ inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device.
Examples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon.
Other preventer medicines
If regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. Two possible alternatives include:
leukotriene receptor antagonists – tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways
theophyllines – tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents
Oral steroids
If your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. This treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist).
Oral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways:
to regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset – for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped
when long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications – in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the future
Long-term use of oral steroids has serious possible side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.
Omalizumab (Xolair)
Omalizumab, also known as Xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. This lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack.
It is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma.
The National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people with allergy-related asthma who need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.
Omalizumab is given as an injection every two to four weeks. It should only be prescribed in a specialist centre. If omalizumab does not control asthma symptoms within 16 weeks, the treatment should be stopped.

NICE: omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthma
Bronchial thermoplasty
Bronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure that can be used in some cases of severe asthma. It works by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can reduce their ability to narrow the airways.
The procedure is carried out either with sedation or under
general anaesthetic
. A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose so it touches the airways.
The probe then uses controlled heat to damage the muscles around the airways. Three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least three weeks between each session.
There is some evidence to show this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma.
However, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission.
You should discuss this procedure fully with your clinician if the treatment is offered.

NICE: bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma
Side effects of treatments
Side effects of relievers and preventers
Relievers are a safe and effective medicine, and have few side effects as long as they are not used too much. The main side effects include a mild shaking of the hands (tremors),
headaches
and muscle cramps. These usually only happen with high doses of reliever inhaler and usually only last for a few minutes.
Preventers are very safe at usual doses, although they can cause a range of side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use.
The main side effect of preventer inhalers is a fungal infection of the mouth or throat
(oral candidiasis)
. You may also develop a hoarse voice and
sore throat
.
Using a spacer can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after using your preventer inhaler.
Your doctor or nurse will discuss with you the need to balance control of your asthma with the risk of side effects, and how to keep side effects to a minimum.
Side effects of add-on therapy
Long-acting relievers may cause similar side effects to short-acting relievers. You should be monitored at the beginning of your treatment and reviewed regularly. If you find there is no benefit to using the long-acting reliever, it should be stopped.
Theophylline tablets have been known to cause side effects in some people, including nausea, vomiting, tremors and noticeable heartbeats (palpitations). These can usually be avoided by adjusting the dose according to periodic measurement of the theophylline concentration in the blood.
Side effects of leukotriene receptor agonists can include
tummy (abdominal) pain
and headaches.
Side effects of steroid tablets
Oral steroids carry a risk if they are taken for more than three months or if they are taken frequently (more than three or four courses of steroids a year). Side effects can include:
osteoporosis (fragile bones)
high blood pressure (hypertension)
diabetes
increased appetite, leading to weight gain
cataracts and glaucoma (eye disorders)
thinning of the skin
easy bruising
muscle weakness
With the exception of increased appetite, which is very commonly experienced by people taking oral steroids, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon.
However, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for them regularly, especially side effects that are not immediately obvious, such as high blood pressure, thinning of the bones, diabetes and glaucoma.
You will need regular appointments to check for these.

Asthma UK: side effects of asthma medicines
Asthma attacks
A personal asthma action plan will help you recognise the initial symptoms of an asthma attack, know how to respond, and when to seek medical attention.
In most cases, the following actions will be recommended:
Take one to two puffs of your reliever inhaler (usually blue) immediately.
Sit down and try to take slow, steady breaths.
If you do not start to feel better, take two puffs of your reliever inhaler (one puff at a time) every two minutes (you can take up to 10 puffs) – this is easier using a spacer, if you have one.
If you do not feel better after taking your inhaler as above or if you are worried at any time, phone 999.
If an ambulance does not arrive within 10 minutes and you are still feeling unwell, repeat step three.
If your symptoms improve and you do not need to phone 999, you still need to see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours.
If you are admitted to hospital, you will be given a combination of oxygen, reliever and preventer medicines to bring your asthma under control.
Your personal asthma action plan will need to be reviewed after an asthma attack, so reasons for the attack can be identified and avoided in future.
Read further information:
Asthma UK: what to do in an asthma attack
Personal asthma action plan
As part of your initial assessment, you should be encouraged to draw up a personal asthma action plan with your GP or asthma nurse.
If you’ve been admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack, you should be offered an action plan (or the opportunity to review an existing action plan) before you go home.
The action plan should include information about your asthma medicines, and will help you recognise when your symptoms are getting worse and what steps to take. You should also be given information about what to do if you have an asthma attack.
Your personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your GP or asthma nurse at least once a year, or more frequently if your symptoms are severe.
As part of your asthma plan, you may be given a
peak flow meter
. This will give you another way of monitoring your asthma, rather than relying only on symptoms, so you can recognise deterioration earlier and take appropriate steps.
Read further information:
Asthma UK: personal asthma action plan
What is good asthma care?
Your doctor or nurse will tailor your asthma treatment to your symptoms. Sometimes you may need to be on higher levels of medication than at others.
You should be offered:
care at your GP surgery provided by doctors and nurses trained in asthma management
full information about your condition and how to control it
involvement in making decisions about your treatment
regular checks to ensure your asthma is under control and your treatment is right for you (this should be at least once a year)
a written personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse
It is also important that your GP or pharmacist teaches you how to properly use your inhaler, as this is an important part of good asthma care.
Occupational asthma
If it is possible you have asthma associated with your job (occupational asthma), you will be referred to a respiratory specialist to confirm the diagnosis.
If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer.
Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. It may sometimes be possible to substitute or remove the substance triggering your occupational asthma from your workplace, to redeploy you to another role within the company, or to wear protective breathing equipment.
However, you may need to consider changing your job or relocating away from your work environment, ideally within 12 months of your symptoms developing.
Some people with occupational asthma may be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.

Asthma UK: occupational asthma
GOV.UK: Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit

Complementary therapies
A number of complementary therapies have been suggested for the treatment of asthma, including:
breathing exercises
traditional Chinese herbal medicine
acupuncture
ionisers – devices that use an electric current to charge (ionise) molecules of air
manual therapies – such as chiropractic
hypnosis
homoeopathy
dietary supplements
However, there is little evidence that any of these treatments, other than breathing exercises, are effective.
There is some evidence that breathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. These include breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist, yoga and the Buteyko method (a technique involving slowed, controlled breathing).

Asthma UK: complementary therapies
Living with asthma
With the right treatment and management, asthma shouldn’t restrict your daily life (including your sleep) in any way. You should work with your healthcare professionals and strive to achieve this goal.
You should also be confident about how to recognise when your asthma is getting out of control, and what to do if it does.
Sleeping
Asthma symptoms are often worse at night. This means you might wake up some nights coughing or with a tight chest.
If your child has asthma, poor sleep can affect their behaviour and concentration, as well as their ability to learn.
Effectively controlling asthma with the treatment your doctor or nurse recommends will reduce the symptoms, so you or your child should sleep better.
Read about
living with insomnia
for more tips on getting better sleep.
Exercise
Very occasionally, people with asthma develop symptoms only during exercise. However, usually this is a sign that your asthma could be better controlled generally.
If you or your child have asthma symptoms during or after exercise, speak to your doctor or asthma nurse. It is likely they will review your general symptoms and personal asthma plan to make sure the condition is under control.
Your doctor or asthma nurse may also advise that:
you make sure the people you are exercising with know you have asthma
you increase your fitness levels gradually
you always have your reliever inhaler (usually blue) with you when you exercise
you use your reliever inhaler immediately before you warm up
you ensure that you always warm up and down thoroughly
if you have symptoms while you are exercising, stop what you’re doing, take your reliever inhaler and wait until you feel better before starting again
Read about
health and fitness
for more information on simple ways to exercise.
Diet
Most people with asthma can eat a normal, healthy diet. Occasionally, people with asthma may have food-based allergic triggers and will need to avoid foods such as cows’ milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, yeast products, nuts, and some food colourings and preservatives. However, this is uncommon.

eating well

Asthma UK: exercise
Asthma UK: diet and food
Know your triggers
It’s important to identify possible asthma triggers by making a note of any worsening symptoms or by using your peak flow meter during exposure to certain situations.
Read our page on the
causes of asthma
for more information about potential triggers.
Some triggers, such as air pollution, illnesses and certain weather conditions, can be hard to avoid. However, it may be possible to avoid other triggers, such as dust mites, fungal spores, pet fur and certain medications that trigger your symptoms.
Make sure your healthcare team knows about and investigates triggers for your symptoms that you may have noticed yourself.

Allergy prevention
Asthma UK: asthma triggers A-Z
Complications of asthma
Quality of life
Badly controlled asthma can have an adverse effect on your quality of life. The condition can result in:
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
underperformance or absence from work or school
psychological problems – including stress, anxiety and
depression
disruption of your work and leisure because of unexpected visits to your GP or hospital
in children, delays in growth or puberty
Children may also feel excluded from their school friends if they cannot take part in games, sports and social activities.
Respiratory complications
In rare cases, asthma can lead to a number of serious respiratory complications, including:
pneumonia
the collapse of part or all of the lung
respiratory failure – where levels of oxygen in the blood become dangerously low, or levels of carbon dioxide become dangerously high
status asthmaticus (severe asthma attacks that do not respond to normal treatment)
All these complications are life threatening and will need medical treatment.
Death
Although most people are able to effectively control their symptoms, asthma can be a life-threatening condition.
Often, people who die from asthma do so at home because they do not recognise when their condition is getting worse or leave it too long to take action.
Do not let this happen to you. Be confident in recognising deterioration of your asthma and what action to take. Take action promptly – never ignore severe asthma.
Asthma and pregnancy
As a result of changes that take place in the body during pregnancy, many women find their asthma symptoms change when they are pregnant. Some women find their asthma improves during pregnancy, while others see it worsen. For others, it stays the same.
The most severe asthma symptoms experienced by pregnant women tend to occur between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy. Symptoms then decrease significantly during the last month of pregnancy.
Only 10% of women experience asthma symptoms during labour and delivery, and these symptoms can normally be controlled through the use of reliever medicine.
It’s important to ensure your condition is well controlled during pregnancy, because poorly controlled asthma can lead to complications such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth and restricted growth of the baby in the womb. Good asthma control also minimises the chance of problems during labour and delivery.
You should manage your asthma in the same way you did before you were pregnant. The medicines used for asthma – particularly those that are inhaled – are generally considered to be safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding your child.
The one exception is leukotriene receptor antagonists. These are not known to be harmful, but there is insufficient experience of their use in pregnancy to be absolutely certain.
If, however, you do need to take leukotriene receptor antagonists to control your asthma, you may decide (in discussion with your GP or asthma clinic and obstetrician) that you should carry on taking them and that the potential risks to you and your child from uncontrolled asthma are likely to be far higher than any potential risk from this medicine.
Read further information:
Asthma UK: pregnancy
Asthma at school
Most children with well-controlled asthma can learn and participate in school activities completely unaffected by their condition.
However, it is important to ensure the school has up-to-date written information about your child’s asthma medicines, how much they take, and when they need to take them.
You may also need to supply the school with a spare reliever inhaler for your child to use if they experience symptoms during the school day.
Staff at the school should be able to recognise worsening asthma symptoms and know what to do in the event of an attack, particularly staff supervising sport or physical education.
Your child’s school should have an asthma policy in place, which you can ask to see.
Read further information:
Asthma UK: your child at school
Financial support
Depending on how severely asthma affects you on a daily basis, you may be entitled to some benefits, such as:
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) – a benefit paid to people who are not able to work because of ill health or disability
Attendance Allowance – a benefit for help with the extra costs you may have if you’re 65 or over and have a physical or mental disability, and need someone to help look after you
Read further information:
GOV.UK: benefits
Asthma UK: financial help
Occupational asthma
If you develop asthma because of your work, and this is fully documented by your doctor and your employer, you can make a claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit from the Benefits Agency.
This is a weekly amount paid to people with asthma caused by exposure to a specific substance through their work and is known to be associated with asthma (a complete list is available from the
Health and Safety Executive
).
If you want to take legal action against your employer because of occupational asthma, your lawyer must act within three years of diagnosis.

Get in touch with others
Many people with a long-term health condition experience feelings of stress, anxiety and
depression
.
You may find it helpful to talk about your experience of asthma with others in a similar position. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who have been diagnosed with asthma and have undergone treatment.
If you experience feelings of depression, talk to your GP. They will be able to give advice and support. Alternatively, find depression support services in your area.

About atopic eczema
Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.
Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children.
Atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, but the most common areas to be affected are:
backs or fronts of the knees
outside or inside of the elbows
around the neck
hands
cheeks
scalp
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).

What causes atopic eczema?
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it’s clear it’s not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get
allergies
– “atopic” means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as
asthma
and
hay fever
.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes
food allergies
can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
Read more about the
causes of atopic eczema
.
Treating atopic eczema
There is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
However, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids
– used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
When to get professional advice

Who is affected?
About 1 in 5 children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. Many children develop it before their first birthday.
Atopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve by the age of 16.
However, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.
There will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2 or 3 times a month.
Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults.
The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.
Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.
Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It’s not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old inflammation and will eventually return to its normal colour.
Atopic eczema often occurs on the insides of the elbows.

Atopic eczema can occur on the face.

Signs of an infection
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:
your eczema getting a lot worse
fluid oozing from the skin
a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema
the skin becoming swollen and sore
a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell
See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected.
Read more about infections and other
complications of atopic eczema
.
Causes of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things.
People with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain much moisture.
This dryness may make the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy.
You may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents.
Research has shown children who have 1 or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves.
Atopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact.
Eczema triggers
There are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. These can vary from person to person.
Common triggers include:
irritants – such as soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid and bubble bath
environmental factors or
allergens
– such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds
food allergies
– such as allergies to cows’ milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat
certain materials worn next to the skin – such as wool and synthetic fabrics
hormonal changes – women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy
skin infections
Some people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed, sweaty, or too hot or too cold.
If you are diagnosed with atopic eczema, your pharmacist or GP will work with you to try to identify any triggers for your symptoms. Read more about
diagnosing atopic eczema
.
Diagnosing atopic eczema
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions about your symptoms.
These questions may include asking:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as
allergies
or
asthma
You should tell your pharmacist or GP if your condition is affecting your quality of life – for example, if you have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or your eczema limits your everyday activities.
Checklist for diagnosing atopic eczema
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or
hay fever
– children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Establishing triggers
Your pharmacist should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse.
You may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. For example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse.
You may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
A food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. Your pharmacist can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat.
Allergy tests
are not usually needed to identify triggers, although they are sometimes helpful in identifying food allergies that may be triggering symptoms in young children or in those where a food allergy is suspected.

Treating atopic eczema
There is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. Many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older.
The main treatments for atopic eczema are:
emollients (moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry
topical corticosteroids
– creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups
Other treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment, antihistamines for severe itching, bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath, or more powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist).
The various treatments for atopic eczema are outlined below.
Self care
As well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things you can do yourself to help ease your symptoms and prevent further problems.
Try to reduce the damage from scratching
Eczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur.
The skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. Deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred.
Try to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin.
Keep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching.
Avoid triggers
Your pharmacist will work with you to establish what might trigger the eczema flare-ups, although it may get better or worse for no obvious reason.
Once you know your triggers, you can try to avoid them. For example:
if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton
if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom
avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin – use soap substitutes instead
Although some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn’t recommended as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps.

preventing allergies
.
Dietary changes
Some foods, such as eggs and cows’ milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. However, you should not make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your pharmacist or GP.
It may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods.
If your GP suspects you have a
food allergy
, you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you’re allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need.
Alternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician.
If you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet.
Emollients
Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema.
In addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have.
Choosing an emollient
Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:
an ointment for very dry skin
a cream or lotion for less dry skin
an emollient to use instead of soap
an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower
one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body
The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin.
Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.
If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin.
If this is the case, your pharmacist will be able to recommend another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day.
How to use emollients
Use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area.
To apply the emollient:
use a large amount
don’t rub it in – smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead
after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in
You should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin.
During a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid as emollients used on their own are not enough to control it.
Don’t put your fingers into an emollient pot – use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people.
Topical corticosteroids
If your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days.
Topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected.
They can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone).
If you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your GP regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount.
How to use topical corticosteroids
Don’t be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply.
Most people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often.
When using a topical corticosteroid:
apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night)
apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area
continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated
Occasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed to help prevent flare-ups.
This is sometimes called “weekend treatment”, where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again.
Side effects
Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them.
In rare cases, they may also cause:
thinning of the skin – especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks)
changes in skin colour – usually, skin lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening after eczema is a “footprint” of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments
acne
(spots) – especially when used on the face in teenagers
increased hair growth
Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.
Generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for many months, using them in sensitive areas such as the face, armpits or groin, or using a large amount will increase your risk of side effects. For this reason, you should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema.
They can either be sedating, which cause drowsiness, or non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying a non-sedating antihistamine.
If itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating antihistamine. Sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child’s school know they may not be as alert as normal.
Bandages and wet wraps
In some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema.
These can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out.
Corticosteroid tablets
Corticosteroid tablets
are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5 to 7 days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control.
Longer courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects.
If your GP thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist.
Seeing a specialist
In some cases, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist).
You may be referred if your GP is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not your eczema, your eczema is affecting your daily life, or it’s not clear what is causing it.
A dermatologist may be able to offer the following:
a thorough review of your existing treatment – to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times
topical calcineurin inhibitors – creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus
very strong topical corticosteroids
bandages or wet wraps
phototherapy – ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation
immunosuppressant tablets – to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate
alitretinoin – medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults
A dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from nurse specialists, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you need it.
Complications of atopic eczema
People with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems.
Bacterial skin infections
As atopic eczema can cause your skin to become cracked and broken, there is a risk of the skin becoming infected with bacteria. The risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or do not use your treatments correctly.
Signs of a bacterial infection can include:
fluid oozing from the skin
a yellow crust on the skin surface
small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema
the skin becoming swollen and sore
a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell
Your normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments.
You should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected.
They will usually prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules or cream to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled.
Speak to your pharmacist or GP if these don’t help or your symptoms get worse.
Once your infection has cleared, your GP should prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you’re using to avoid contamination. Old treatments should be disposed of.
Viral skin infections
It’s also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causes
cold sores
. This can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum.
Symptoms of eczema herpeticum include:
areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse
groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin
a high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some cases
Contact your doctor immediately if you think you or your child may have eczema herpeticum. If you cannot contact your GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital.
If you are diagnosed with eczema herpeticum, you will be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir.
Psychological effects
As well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically.
Preschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who do not have the condition. They are also more likely to be more dependent on their parents.
Bullying
Schoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with.
Your child may become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child’s teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling.
The National Eczema Society provides information about
regional support groups
, where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema.
Problems sleeping
Sleep-related problems are common among people with eczema.
A lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work.
If your child has problems sleeping because of their eczema, they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It might help to let their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration.
During a severe eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies.
Self-confidence
Atopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may lead to them having a poor self-image.
If your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child’s self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance.
Speak to your GP if you are concerned your child’s eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/anxiety-disorders-in-children/,"Anxiety disorders in children
It’s normal for children to feel worried or anxious from time to time, like when they’re starting school or nursery, or moving to a new area.
Anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear. It’s an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event.
But for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis. This can interfere with their school, home and social life. If your child is anxious for a period of time and it’s impacting on day to day life you may need to speak to a healthcare professional to help support your child. For example, if they feel they cannot go to school or see their friends anymore.
So how do you know when your child’s anxiety has reached this stage?
What are the signs of anxiety in children?
Anxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed.
Some of the signs to look out for in your child are:
finding it hard to concentrate
not sleeping, or waking in the night
not eating properly
quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts
constantly worrying or having negative thoughts
feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often
always crying
being clingy all the time (when other children are ok)
complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell
being withdrawn and not wanting to do things they used to enjoy
Your child may not be old enough to recognise why they’re feeling this way.
The reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety is common in younger children. Older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health.
What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience?
The common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are :
A fear or phobia about something specific
Young children are commonly afraid of things like the dark or imaginary things like monsters. This is a normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child’s day-to-day life.
Read about phobias
Feeling anxious for most of the time for no apparent reason
It’s normal for children to frequently have fears and worries. Some anxious children may develop a condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they get older.
Generalised anxiety disorder
causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. It’s a feeling of constant fear or dread all the time that makes doing daily tasks hard because of feelings of anxiety.
People affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.
Separation anxiety
Separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer.
It’s common in young children, and normally develops at about 6 months of age. It can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult.
Separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they’re feeling insecure about something. They could be reacting to changes at home or at school, for example.
Social anxiety
Social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities.
Social ‘shyness’ is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers. However it becomes a problem – ‘social anxiety disorder’ – when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating.
Social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who’ve gone through puberty.
School-based anxiety
Some children become anxious about going to school. This could also be about schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they’re changing school or moving up a level.
They may not always share these worries with you, and instead they may say they have a tummy ache or are feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.
This may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life.
Less common anxiety disorders
Post-traumatic stress disorder
and
obsessive compulsive disorder
are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults.
When is anxiety a disorder that needs treating?
You should seek help for your child’s anxiety if:
you feel it’s not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked
you think it’s slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships
it happens very frequently or they feel anxious all the time
it’s making them feel physically unwell a lot of the time like feeling sick or having constant headaches
your child becomes very withdrawn and is anxious about doing things they used to enjoy
How serious can it be?
Long-term anxiety can severely interfere with a child’s personal development, family life and schooling.
Anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood.
Teenagers with an anxiety disorder can also:
experience
clinical depression
feel hopeless
misuse drugs
What can I do to help my child?
If a child is experiencing anxiety, there’s plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it’s important to listen to your child about their anxiety or worries.
Where should I go for help?
You can talk to your GP or someone at your child’s school like the school nurse. You might want to do this on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The healthcare professional should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next.
Your child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). CAMHS staff are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include:
psychologists
psychiatrists
nurses
occupational therapists
physiotherapists
and other specially trained professionals
They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child.
More about CAMHS
Youth counselling services
If your child doesn’t want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service.
Youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what’s worrying them, and get advice.
For more information,
search Scotland’s Service Directory
for mental health and wellbeing services in your area. Counselling may also be available in your local school.
Telephone or online help
Telephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people. They might feel it’s easier to talk to someone who doesn’t know them.
How do you treat anxiety disorders?
The type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child’s anxiety.
It can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what’s worrying them to a trained person, especially as it’s someone they don’t know.
If your child is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they’re at a youth counselling service, it might be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist.
These sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation.
Psychological therapies
Psychological therapies can really help with anxiety. They’re evidence based talking treatments, like cognitive behavioural therapy, that are proven to help.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.
It’s been proven to help with anxiety and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious.
Your child will work with the psychological therapist to find ways to change the way they think. They’ll help your child to find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. The
psychological therapies matrix
describes the most helpful talking therapies for anxiety.
What is psychological therapy?
Medication
If your child’s anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication.
A type of
antidepressant
, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things.
Antidepressants usually take around 2 to 4 weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately.
It’s natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen.
Why are some children affected and others not?
Some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children.
Sometimes traumatic life events like an illness, or an accident, can cause anxiety. This can happen even if your child was previously confident by nature before.
A child’s anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they’ve inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger.
Life events
Some children can also develop anxiety after a series of difficult life events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together, or a traumatic single event, may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are:
frequently moving house and school – it can be hard to settle when you’re always expecting change
divorce or separation of parents
death of a close relative or friend
becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident
having someone in the family who is ill or disabled
school-related issues like homework or exams, or bullying or friendship problems
becoming involved in crime
being abused or neglected
Medical conditions
Children with certain conditions such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
and
autistic spectrum disorders
may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition. This is because of differences in the way their brain functions."

About asbestosis
Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction.
Asbestos can be very dangerous. It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.
When the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure.
Read more about the
causes of asbestosis
.
Symptoms of asbestosis
Breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including:
shortness of breath – this may only occur after physical activity at first, but it can eventually become a more constant problem
a persistent
cough
wheezing
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
chest pain
in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips
Nowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace.
See your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past.
Read more about
diagnosing asbestosis
.
Treating asbestosis
There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.
One of the most important things someone with the condition can do is to
stop smoking
, if they smoke. This is because the symptoms are more likely to get worse in people who smoke, and smoking also increases the risk of
lung cancer
in people with asbestosis.
If necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis.
Read more about
treating asbestosis
.
Outlook
The outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present.
Asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person’s health and shorten their life expectancy, but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all.
However, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:
pleural disease – where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort
mesothelioma
– a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut
lung cancer
Overall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself.
Compensation
If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through:
industrial injuries disablement benefit – this is a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed)
a civil claim for compensation through the courts – you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this
a claim for a lump compensation sum under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979 – if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven’t been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading
Read more about
industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website
.
Preventing asbestosis
There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these – called crocidolite and amosite – were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999.
However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings.
It’s therefore important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos.
If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself.
If your job means you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely.

preventing asbestosis

Who is affected
Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years.
However, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.
Causes of asbestosis
Asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past.
What is asbestos?
Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. Materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant.
There were three main types of asbestos in commercial use:
crocidolite (‘blue asbestos’)
amosite (‘brown asbestos’)
chrysotile (‘white asbestos’)
All these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air.
No crocidolite was imported into the UK after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). Chrysotile was not banned until 1999.
This means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.
How asbestos fibres affect the lungs
When you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream.
However, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. In an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. This scarring is what is known as asbestosis.
Alveoli are crucial in transferring oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. If they become damaged and scarred, these processes will be affected, resulting in symptoms such as breathlessness.
For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure – usually over many years – to relatively high numbers of asbestosis fibres is necessary.
Occupations associated with asbestos exposure
The use of asbestos increased significantly after World War II. It peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period.
Occupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period include:
insulation workers
boilermakers
plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters
shipyard workers
sheet metal workers
plasterers
chemical technicians
heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics
Now that asbestos is no longer used, those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers, electricians and demolition workers.
The
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website
has further information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure.
Diagnosing asbestosis
When diagnosing asbestosis, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).
If your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in.
Your GP will also ask about your work history, particularly about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working.
Referral to a specialist
If asbestosis is suspected, you will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include:
a chest
X-ray
– to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
of the lungs – which produces more detailed images of the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities
lung function tests – to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstream
Before confirming a diagnosis of asbestosis, the chest specialist will also consider and rule out other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
.
Treating asbestosis
There is no cure for asbestosis, as the damage to the lungs is irreversible. However, you can take steps to reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
Not smoking
If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it’s very important to stop as soon as possible.
Smoking can make your symptoms of breathlessness worse and significantly increase your risk of developing
lung cancer
at a later stage.
Speak to your GP for help with giving up smoking. They can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. Your GP can also put you in touch with local support groups in your area.
You can also phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking.

stopping smoking
.
Vaccinations
If you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection.
It’s recommended that you have the influenza (flu) vaccination to protect against
flu
, and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such as
pneumonia
. Your GP can arrange for you to have these vaccinations.
You will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. Most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor.
Long-term oxygen therapy
If you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all the oxygen it needs to function properly.
Oxygen therapy
may be recommended if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood.
Oxygen therapy is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air.
This oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula).
You may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you’re out of the house. This is known as ambulatory oxygen.
It’s very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. This is because high concentrations of oxygen are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion.
Medication
Most people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
.
More severe cases may benefit from medicines, such as small doses of morphine to reduce breathlessness and a
cough
.
Serious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. The most common problem is
constipation
, and a
laxative
will usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools.
Preventing asbestosis
Although asbestos is no longer widely used in the UK, it’s still important to take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure, because it’s still found in many old buildings.
Strict regulations were introduced in 1970 to regulate the use of asbestos in the workplace.
However, the import, supply and use of brown (amosite) and blue (crocidolite) asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1985. White asbestos (chrysotile) was banned in 1999, except for a small number of specialist uses of the material.
This means that buildings that were built or refurbished before the year 2000 could still contain asbestos.
Asbestos in your home
If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council.
In these circumstances, it may be best to leave any asbestos-containing materials where they are – especially if they are in good condition and unlikely to get damaged. You should check the condition of the materials from time to time to make sure they haven’t been damaged or started to deteriorate.
Slightly damaged asbestos-containing materials can sometimes be repaired by sealing or enclosing them. However, this should only be done by someone with the necessary training. Any badly-damaged asbestos material that cannot be protected should be removed by someone who is appropriately trained. Your local environmental health officer can advise you about this.
If you are planning any home improvements, repairs or maintenance, and you intend to bring in any additional workers or contractors, you should inform them of any asbestos materials in your home before they start work. This will help reduce the risks of any asbestos-containing material being disturbed.
You can search for
who to contact about asbestos in your home
on the GOV.UK website.
Asbestos in your workplace
If your job doesn’t directly put you at risk of asbestos exposure, but you are concerned about asbestos in your workplace, speak to the building duty holder about what they are doing to monitor and manage the situation.
A duty holder is someone who is responsible for maintaining and repairing non-domestic premises.
If any asbestos-containing materials in your workplace are assessed as being in good condition, and not in a position where they are likely to be damaged, they will usually be left in place and monitored.
However, asbestos-containing materials that are in a poor condition or are likely to be damaged during the normal use of the building should be sealed, enclosed or removed as appropriate.
Working with asbestos
If your job means that you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure the appropriate precautions are taken before and during any work you do.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has drawn up the following checklist for employers, managers and traders to go through before carrying out work on a building that may contain asbestos:
Identify whether asbestos is present and determine its type and condition – this may mean checking with the building manager or having the area surveyed.
Carry out a risk assessment to determine whether it’s possible to carry out the work, while avoiding the risk of asbestos exposure completely.
Decide if the work needs to be carried out by a licensed contractor – the removal of certain types of asbestos-containing material will need to be done by a contractor holding a licence from the HSE.
If the work is not licensable, decide if the work needs to be notified – some jobs require the relevant enforcing authority to be notified of what you are doing
Ensure that those carrying out the work are suitably trained – any worker who may disturb asbestos during their daily work needs to receive appropriate training, so that they can protect themselves and others.
Steps that may help reduce your exposure to asbestos during your work include wearing protective equipment (such as a suitable face mask), cleaning up as you go (using a vacuum cleaner or wet rags, rather than sweeping) and not using power tools whenever possible.

About appendicitis
Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5 to 10cm (2 to 4 inches) long. It’s connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed.
Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn’t harmful.
Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.
Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe.
Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience
diarrhoea
.

symptoms of appendicitis
.
When to get medical help
If you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren’t available, phone NHS 24’s
111
service for advice.
You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen.
These are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.

complications of appendicitis
How appendicitis is treated
In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.
Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent.
The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.
Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.
Most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6 weeks after open surgery.
Read more about
treating appendicitis
.
What causes appendicitis?
It’s not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something blocks the entrance of the appendix.
For example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.
This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.
As the causes aren’t fully understood, there’s no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.
Who’s affected?
Appendicitis is a common condition. It’s estimated around 1 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life.
Appendicitis can develop at any age, but it’s most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.
Symptoms of appendicitis
Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.
Within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.
Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.
If you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including:
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face
When to get medical help
If you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or
local out-of-hours service
immediately. If these options aren’t available, phone
NHS 24 111 Service
for advice.
Appendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as:
gastroenteritis
severe
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
constipation
bladder or
urine infections
Crohn’s disease
pelvic infection
In young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as an
ectopic pregnancy
or menstrual pain.
However, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention.
You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.
If the appendix bursts, it can cause peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.
Read more about the
complications of appendicitis
.
Diagnosing appendicitis
Appendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases.
Also, some people’s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as:
the pelvis
behind the large intestine
around the small bowel
near the right lower part of the liver
Some people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it’s caused by something else, such as:
gastroenteritis
severe
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
constipation
a bladder or
urine infection
Your GP will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side).
If your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your GP to make a confident diagnosis. In this case, you’ll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.
Further tests
If your symptoms aren’t typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.
Further tests may involve:
a
blood test
to look for signs of infection
a pregnancy test for women
a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection
an
ultrasound scan
to see if the appendix is swollen
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
It can sometimes take time to get test results. Your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain.
You’ll usually be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it’s eventually found to be normal.
In some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse.
If your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you’ll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment.

Treating appendicitis
If you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.
Surgery is usually also recommended if there’s a chance you have appendicitis but it’s not been possible to make a clear diagnosis.
This is because it’s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting.
In humans, the appendix doesn’t perform any important function and having it removed doesn’t cause any long-term problems.
The procedure
Appendectomies are carried out under
general anaesthetic
using either a keyhole or open technique.
Keyhole surgery
Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery.
This operation involves making 3 or 4 small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including:
a tube that gas is pumped through to inflate your abdomen – this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work
a laparoscope – a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor
small surgical tools used to remove the appendix
Once the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable stitches. Regular stitches may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later.
Open surgery
In some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn’t recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include:
when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass
when the surgeon isn’t very experienced in laparoscopic removal
people who have previously had open abdominal surgery
In these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix.
When there’s widespread peritonitis – infection of the inner lining of the abdomen – it’s sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy.
As with keyhole surgery, the incision is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches that need to be removed at a later date.
After both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it’s rare for a serious problem to be found.
Recovery
One of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation.
If the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery – for example, if you have peritonitis – it may take up to a week before you’re well enough to go home.
For the first few days after the operation you’re likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary.
If you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation.
You may also experience some short-term
constipation
. You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome.
Before leaving hospital, you’ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid.
In most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery.
When to seek medical advice
While you recover, it’s important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems.
Contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice:
increasing pain and swelling
you start vomiting repeatedly
a high temperature (fever)
any discharge coming from the wound
the wound is hot to touch
These symptoms could be a sign of infection.
Risks
Appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare.
However, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include:
antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections
bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) – this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you’re concerned
scarring – both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made
a collection of pus (abscess) – in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery
hernia – at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach
The use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to
pneumonia
. However, serious complications like this are very rare.
Alternatives to emergency surgery
In some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass.
This lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself.
If an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it’s not necessary to operate immediately.
Instead, you’ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled.
Another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis.
However, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn’t enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.
Complications of appendicitis
If appendicitis isn’t treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections.
Phone 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.
Peritonitis
If your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. This can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen.
Symptoms of peritonitis can include:
severe continuous abdominal pain
feeling sick or being sick
a high temperature (fever)
a rapid heartbeat
shortness of breath
with rapid breathing
swelling of the abdomen
If peritonitis isn’t treated immediately, it can cause long-term problems and may even be fatal. Treatment for peritonitis usually involves
antibiotics
and the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy).
Abscesses
Sometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix. This is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body’s attempt to fight the infection.
It can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases.
Abscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess.
This can be carried out under
ultrasound
or
computerised tomography (CT)
guidance using
local anaesthetic
and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the placement of a drain.
If an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed out and a course of antibiotics is given."

About arthritis
Living with arthritis
About arthritis
Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.
In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children (see below).
Types of arthritis
The two most common types of arthritis are:
osteoarthritis
rheumatoid arthritis
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people.
It most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. It’s also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.
Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes.
Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.
The most commonly affected joints are those in the:
hands
spine
knees
hips
Rheumatoid arthritis
In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.
Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body’s immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.
The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint’s shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.
People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.
Other types of arthritis and related conditions
Ankylosing spondylitis
– a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints.
Cervical spondylosis – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness.
Fibromyalgia
– causes pain in the body’s muscles, ligaments and tendons.
Lupus
– an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body’s tissues.
Gout
– a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling.
Psoriatic arthritis – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with
psoriasis
.
Enteropathic arthritis – a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being
ulcerative colitis
and
Crohn’s disease
. About one in five people with Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine.
Reactive arthritis
– this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through). It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection.
Secondary arthritis – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards.
Polymyalgia rheumatica
– a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation.
Symptoms of arthritis
The symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.
This is why it’s important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:
joint pain, tenderness and stiffness
inflammation in and around the joints
restricted movement of the joints
warm, red skin over the affected joint
weakness and muscle wasting
Arthritis and children
Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis.
Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks.
Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.
The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of
juvenile idiopathic arthritis
.
Oligo-articular JIA
Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body – most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.
Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there’s a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended.
Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)
Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood.
The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the
symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis
. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.
Systemic onset JIA
Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed.
Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.
Enthesitis-related arthritis
Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone.
Treating arthritis
There’s no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.
For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including:
painkillers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
corticosteroids
In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended:
arthroplasty (joint replacement)
arthodesis (joint fusion)
osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned)
Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition’s progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:
analgesics (painkillers)
disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) – a combination of treatments is often recommended
physiotherapy
regular exercise

how rheumatoid arthritis is treated
.
Living with arthritis
Living with arthritis isn’t easy and carrying out simple, everyday tasks can often be painful and difficult.
However, there are many things you can do to make sure you live a healthy lifestyle. A range of services and benefits are also available.
Work
Many people with arthritis want to continue working for many reasons, including better financial security and higher self-esteem.
Better treatment options have helped to ensure that many people return to work after being diagnosed with arthritis. This is particularly the case if arthritis is diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
You may find work challenging, but your employer should help you with the training and support you need.
Help is also available if your arthritis is so severe that you’re unable to work. Find out more about the
Personal Independence Payment
(formerly known as the Disability Living Allowance).
Healthy eating
It’s very important to eat a healthy, balanced diet if you have arthritis. Eating healthily will give you all the nutrients you need and help you maintain a healthy weight.
Your diet should consist of a variety of foods from all 5 food groups. These are:
fruit and vegetables
starchy foods
– like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta
meat, fish, eggs and beans
milk and dairy foods
foods containing
fat and sugar
Further information about how to have a
healthy, balanced diet
.
Weight
If you’re overweight, losing weight can really help you cope with arthritis. Too much weight places excess pressure on the joints in your hips, knees, ankles and feet, leading to increased pain and mobility problems.
Further information about how you can
lose weight.
Exercise
If your arthritis is painful, you may not feel like exercising. However, being active can help reduce and prevent pain. Regular exercise can also:
improve your range of movement and joint mobility
increase muscle strength
reduce stiffness
boost your energy
As long as you do the right type and level of exercise for your condition, your arthritis won’t get any worse. Combined with a healthy, balanced diet (see above), regular exercise will help you lose weight and place less strain on your joints.
Your GP can advise about the type and level of exercise that’s right for you.
Versus Arthritis also has further information about
exercising with arthritis
.
Joint care
If you have arthritis, it’s important to look after your joints so there’s no further damage. For example, try to reduce the stress on your joints while carrying out everyday tasks like moving and lifting.
Some tips for protecting your joints, particularly if you have arthritis, include:
use larger, stronger joints as levers – for example, take the pressure of opening a heavy door on your shoulder rather than on your hand
use several joints to spread the weight of an object – for example, use both hands to carry your shopping or distribute the weight evenly in a shoulder bag or rucksack
don’t grip too tightly – grip as loosely as possible or use a padded handle to widen your grip
It’s also important to avoid sitting in the same position for long periods of time and to take regular breaks so you can move around.
At home
If you have arthritis, carrying out tasks around the home can be a challenge. However, making some practical changes to your home and changing the way you work should make things easier.
Practical tips that could help include:
keeping things in easy reach
using a hand rail to help you get up and down the stairs
using long-handled tools to pick things up or to clean
fitting levers to taps to make them easier to turn
using electric kitchen equipment, like tin openers, when preparing food
Versus Arthritis has further information and tips for
living with arthritis
.
Occupational therapy
An occupational therapist can help if you have severe arthritis that’s affecting your ability to move around your home and carry out everyday tasks, like cooking and cleaning.
They can advise about equipment you may need to help you live independently.
Depending on the exact nature of your condition, your GP may be able to refer you to an NHS occupational therapist. However, you may need to access this type of therapy through your local council.

About atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition that causes an irregular heart rate.
Most commonly, the heart rate will be unusually fast with this condition; but it is possible for the heart rate to be within accepted limits or slower and still be in atrial fibrillation.
You can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your wrist or neck. A normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. In atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute.
How is atrial fibrillation defined?
Atrial fibrillation is defined in various ways, depending on how it affects you:
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation – this comes and goes, usually stopping within 48 hours without any treatment.
persistent atrial fibrillation – this lasts for longer than seven days, or less when it is treated.
longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation – this means you have had continuous atrial fibrillation for a year or longer.
permanent atrial fibrillation – this is when atrial fibrillation is present all the time and no more attempts to restore normal heart rhythm will be made
What happens in atrial fibrillation?
When the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, so the heart can fill with blood again. This process is repeated every time the heart beats.
Atrial fibrillation occurs when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria (upper chambers of the heart).
These impulses override the heart’s natural pacemaker, which can no longer control the rhythm of the heart. The atria contract randomly and sometimes so fast that the heart muscle cannot relax properly between contractions. This reduces the heart’s efficiency and performance and causes a highly irregular pulse rate.
What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?
Atrial fibrillation can lead to a number of problems, including:
dizziness
feeling faint
shortness of breath
fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
feeling very tired
Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and are completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular.

Why does atrial fibrillation happen and how common is it?
Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance and affects up to 800,000 people in the UK.
The cause of atrial fibrillation is not fully understood, but it tends to occur in certain groups of people and may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking.
The condition can affect adults of any age or gender but:
is more common the older you get
affects about 10% of people over 75
more common in men than women
Atrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, like:
high blood pressure
diabetes
coronary heart disease

What is the outlook with atrial fibrillation?
Atrial fibrillation is generally not life threatening, many people live normal healthy lives with this condition, but it can be uncomfortable and often needs treatment.
This condition increases your risk by about four to five times of having a
transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
or
stroke
.
This is because when the atria in the heart do not contract properly there is a risk of blood clot formation. Clots from the atria may break off and go to other parts of the body. A blood clot passing up to the arteries supplying the brain may cause a stroke.
For this reason, treatment may involve medication to control the heart rate or rhythm, and medication to prevent clots from forming in the blood.

and
possible complications of having AF
Symptoms of atrial fibrillation
The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation (AF) is palpitations caused by a fast and irregular heartbeat.
A normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. In atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute.
If you notice an irregular heartbeat and/or have chest pain, see your doctor immediately.
How to check your heart rate
You can check your heart rate by pressing gently on the pulse in your wrist or neck.
Other symptoms
As well as a fast and irregular heartbeat, you may also experience:
tiredness (inability to carry out  normal exercise for you)
breathlessness
dizziness
feeling faint
palpitations
chest discomfort or pain
Some people have no symptoms
Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and it is only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition.
Causes of atrial fibrillation
The exact cause of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown, but it becomes more common with age and affects certain groups of people more than others.
People with other heart conditions
Atrial fibrillation is common in people with other heart conditions, such as:
high blood pressure
coronary heart disease
heart valve disease
congenital heart disease (heart defects at birth)
heart failure
(from any cause)
People with other medical conditions
Atrial fibrillation is also associated with other medical conditions such as:
hyperthyroidism
(overactive thyroid gland)
heavy alcohol consumption
pneumonia
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
pulmonary embolism (a blockage in a blood vessel in your lungs)
Cause is unknown
Not everyone with atrial fibrillation falls into one of the above groups. Sometimes the cause can be idiopathic (no known cause) and can affect extremely athletic people.
Triggers
Sometimes there is a trigger to an episode of atrial fibrillation, including:
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, particularly binge drinking
being overweight
taking illegal drugs, particularly amphetamines or cocaine
smoking
heightened emotional stress
Diagnosing atrial fibrillation
Feeling your pulse to check if you have an irregular heartbeat can give a strong indication of whether you have atrial fibrillation (AF). However, a complete diagnosis requires a full medical investigation.
If you notice your heartbeat is irregular and/or you have chest pain, see your GP straight away.
If your GP thinks you have atrial fibrillation after assessing your symptoms, you will be asked to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and referred to a heart specialist, known as a cardiologist.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An ECG is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.
Small stickers called electrodes are attached to your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine.
Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. An ECG machine traces these signals on paper.
An ECG is usually carried out in a hospital or GP surgery. It takes about five minutes and is painless.
If you have the test during an episode of atrial fibrillation, the ECG will record your abnormal heart rate. This will confirm the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and rule out other conditions.
However, it may be difficult to capture an episode, as the irregular rhythm may ‘come and go’, therefore, to capture this your GP or cardiologist, may ask you to wear a small, portable ECG recorder for a longer period of time away from the hospital or GP surgery.
Find out more about
having an ECG
Echocardiogram (Echo)
An echocardiogram, sometimes called an echo, is an ultrasound scan of the heart.
It can help identify any other heart problems and assess the structure and function of your heart and valves.
Find out more about
having an echocardiogram
Chest X-ray
A chest
X-ray
may be performed and will identify any lung problems that may have caused the atrial fibrillation.
Blood tests
Blood tests
can also be useful in the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. They may show anaemia, which could be complicating the situation, problems with kidney function or
hyperthyroidism
(overactive thyroid gland).
Treating atrial fibrillation
The treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) varies from person to person and depends on:
the type of atrial fibrillation
symptoms
treatment of any underlying cause
age
overall health
Some people may be treated by their GP, whereas others may be referred to a cardiologist.
Finding an underlying cause
The first step is to try to find out the cause of the atrial fibrillation. If a cause is found, treatment for this may be enough.
For example, medication to correct hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) may cure atrial fibrillation.
If there is no underlying cause found
If no underlying cause of the atrial fibrillation can be found, the treatment options are:
medicines to control atrial fibrillation
restoring a normal heart rhythm
medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke
cardioversion (a controlled electrical shock to reset the heart rhythm)
catheter ablation
having a pacemaker fitted
You can find out more about each of these below.
Medicines to control atrial fibrillation
Medicines called anti-arrhythmics can control atrial fibrillation by:
restoring a normal heart rhythm
controlling the rate at which the heart beats
The choice of anti-arrhythmic medicine depends on:
the type of atrial fibrillation
any other medical conditions you have
side effects of the medicine chosen
how well the atrial fibrillation responds.
Some people with atrial fibrillation may need more than one anti-arrhythmic medicine to control it.
Restoring a normal heart rhythm
There are a number of drugs that can be used to try to restore a normal heart. The best option for you will be decided by your cardiologist and /or GP.
Commonly, these drugs include:
flecainide
beta-blockers
amiodarone
Dronedarone may also be used for certain people.
It is important you know what side effects to look out for if taking such medication and seek medical advice if you experience any of them.
To find out about side effects, read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more details.
Medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke
The way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation means that there is a risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. If these get into the bloodstream, they can cause a stroke (our
complications of atrial fibrillation
section has more information on this).
Your doctor will assess your risk to minimise your chance of a stroke. They will consider your age and whether you have a history of any of the following:
stroke
or blood clots
heart valve problems
heart failure
high blood pressure
diabetes
heart disease
You will be classed as having a high, moderate or low risk of a stroke and will be given medication according to your risk.
Depending on your level of risk, you may be prescribed
warfarin
.
Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants help to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Newer anticoagulants like apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivoroxaban are now more commonly used than warfarin. They do not require dose changes and continuous blood test monitoring.
Warfarin may still be used in patients who can’t be treated with a newer anticoagulant, or in those patients with other conditions where treatment with warfarin is preferred.
Cardioversion
Cardioversion may be tried in some people with atrial fibrillation. The heart is given a controlled electric shock to try to restore a normal rhythm.
The procedure normally takes place in hospital with heavy sedation or anaesthetic and careful monitoring.
In people who have had atrial fibrillation for more than two days, cardioversion is associated with an increased risk of clot formation. If this is the case, warfarin is given for three to four weeks before cardioversion and for at least four weeks afterwards to minimise the chance of having a stroke.
If the cardioversion is successful, warfarin may be stopped. However, some people may need to continue with warfarin if there is a high chance of their atrial fibrillation returning and they have a moderate to high risk of a stroke.
Catheter ablation
Catheter ablation is a procedure that very carefully interrupts abnormal electrical circuits. It is an option if medication has not been effective or tolerated.
Catheters (thin, soft wires) are guided through one of your veins into your heart where they record electrical activity.
When the source of the abnormality is found, an energy source (such as high-frequency radiowaves that generate heat) is transmitted through one of the catheters to destroy the tissue.
This procedure commonly takes two to three hours, so it may be done under
general anaesthetic
, where you are put to sleep.
Find out more about
catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation
on the Arrhythmia Alliance website
Having a pacemaker fitted
A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that is implanted in your chest, just below your collarbone.
It will not cure, reverse or actively treat your atrial fibrillation.
A pacemaker provides beats where your heart is not supplying its own. If your heart beat is very slow the pacemaker will override this and pace at a set rate. If there are significant pauses between your heart beats beats, the pacemaker will supply a beat, acting as a ‘safety net’.
Having a pacemaker fitted
is usually a minor surgical procedure performed under a
local anaesthetic
(where the area is numbed).
Complications of atrial fibrillation
When the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, do not pump efficiently then there is a risk of blood clots forming.
These blood clots may move into the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, and get pumped into the blood supply to the lungs or the general blood circulation.
Stroke
Clots in the general circulation can block arteries in the brain, causing a
stroke
.
The risk of a stroke in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) is four to five times greater than the general population. However, the risk depends on a number of factors, including age, whether you have high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes and a previous history of blood clots.
Heart failure
If your atrial fibrillation is persistent, it may start to weaken your heart muscle.
In extreme cases, it can lead to
heart failure
, where your heart cannot pump blood around your body as efficiently as before."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include:
difficulty concentrating and paying attention
hyperactivity
impulsiveness
Symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers
Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age. They may become more noticeable when a child’s circumstances change, like when they start school.
The main symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are:
Inattentiveness
The main signs of inattentiveness are:
having a short attention span
being easily distracted
making careless mistakes
appearing forgetful
losing things
being unable to stick at tedious or time-consuming tasks
appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions
constantly changing activity or task
having difficulty organising tasks
Hyperactivity and impulsiveness
The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are:
being unable to sit still, especially in quiet surroundings
constantly fidgeting
being unable to concentrate on tasks
excessive physical movement
excessive talking
being unable to wait their turn
acting without thinking
interrupting conversations
little or no sense of danger
Symptoms of ADHD in adults
If you’re an adult with ADHD, you may find that:
you get easily distracted and find it hard to notice details, particularly with things you find boring
it’s hard to listen to other people – you may find yourself finishing their sentences for them or interrupting them
it’s hard to follow instructions
you find it hard to organise yourself – you start a lot of things without ever finishing them
you find it hard to wait
you fidget and can’t sit still when there’s nothing much going on
you’re forgetful and tend to lose or misplace things
you easily get irritable, impatient or frustrated and lose your temper quickly
you feel restless or edgy, have difficulty turning your thoughts off
you find stress hard to handle
you tend to do things on the spur of the moment, without thinking, which gets you into trouble
Some people with ADHD have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious.
Related conditions
Some people might have other conditions alongside ADHD.
Related conditions in children and teenagers with ADHD
Some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, like:
anxiety disorder
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – this involves negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards figures of authority
conduct disorder – this often involves antisocial behaviour, like stealing and harming people or animals
depression
sleep problems
autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)
epilepsy
Tourette’s syndrome
learning difficulties, like dyslexia
The symptoms of ADHD can improve with age. Although many adults diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.
Related conditions in adults with ADHD
ADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions.
One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include:
personality disorders
bipolar disorder
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
ADHD can also cause problems like difficulties with relationships and social interaction.
Causes of ADHD
The exact cause of ADHD isn’t fully understood.
A combination of the following factors might be responsible:
Genetics
ADHD tends to run in families. The genes you you inherit from your parents are a factor in developing the condition. The way ADHD is inherited is complex and isn’t thought to be related to a single gene.
Brain function and structure
Research has identified some possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD.
Some studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be a different size in people with ADHD.
Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have a chemical imbalance in the brain. Or that some chemicals may not work properly.
Groups at risk
Certain people are also believed to be more at risk of ADHD, including people:
who were born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or with a low birthweight
with epilepsy
with brain damage – which happened either in the womb or after a severe head injury later in life
Diagnosing ADHD
Speak to your GP if you think that you or your child may have ADHD.
If you’re worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP. This means you can find out if they have any concerns about your child’s behaviour.
Your GP can’t formally diagnose ADHD. They can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary.
Treating ADHD
Treatment for ADHD can help relieve the symptoms.
ADHD can be treated using medication or therapy. A combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, like a paediatrician or psychiatrist.
Treatment of ADHD might include:
Medication
Medication might help you or your child concentrate better, be less impulsive and feel calmer.
Therapy
You might be offered therapy. This might be:
psychoeducation
behaviour therapy
parent training
education programmes
cognitive behavioural therapy
social skills training
There are other treatments that involve altering your diet or taking supplements."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/binge-eating-disorder/,"Binge eating disorder
Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels they have to overeat through regular binges.
Symptoms of binge eating disorder
The main sign of binge eating disorder is someone bingeing on a regular basis.
Signs that an episode of overeating is actually a binge, include:
eating much faster than normal
eating until you feel uncomfortably full
eating a large amount of food when you’re not hungry
eating alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you’re consuming
having feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards
If you feel like you have to purge what you’ve eaten after a binge to avoid gaining weight, you may have symptoms of
bulimia
.
If binges don’t happen regularly, and your weight is very low, you may have symptoms of
anorexia
.
Treating binge eating disorder
There are some treatments available for binge eating disorder.
Guided self-help
The main type of psychological treatment for binge eating disorder is guided self-help. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll also have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist).
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Another treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another.
If problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing. It helps to identify the underlying issues so you’re less likely to binge in the future.
Learn more about talking therapies
Antidepressants
Antidepressants
may be used alongside other treatments for binge eating disorder.
Long term physical effects of binge eating
Binge eating often leads to weight gain. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk of a number of physical health problems, some of which can be life threatening.
These include:
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
diabetes
osteoarthritis
some types of cancer, like breast cancer and
bowel cancer
If you think you might have a binge eating problem, help is available. You can get support to tackle both the physical and mental effects of binge eating.
Getting help for binge eating disorder
If you have eating problems or think you may have an eating disorder, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.
You could:
talk to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family
see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support
Helping someone else
If someone close to you is showing signs of an eating disorder, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
Your GP or a healthcare professional can give you advice on how to help someone. This includes information on:
the treatments available
how you can support them during their treatment

Facts and myths about autism
About autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually called autism, is something you’re born with. Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you.
Read more about characteristics of autism here
Autism is highly variable – the word ‘spectrum’ refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. Autism is considered a spectrum because it’s different for every autistic person – some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. The way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments.
Read more about support here
Talking about autism
Many people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term ‘autistic’ to describe themselves – this is known as identity-first language (for example, “I’m autistic”). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated.
For a long time people used the term ‘person on the autism spectrum’, known as person-first language (for example, “I’m on the autism spectrum”), and some people still prefer this.
In this guide, we’ll mostly use the term ‘autistic’.
If in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they’d prefer.
In the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including:
Asperger’s Syndrome
autistic disorder
Kanner’s Syndrome
childhood autism
atypical autism
Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)
Because these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism for short. People also use the term ‘autism spectrum condition’ (ASC).

How common is autism?
At least 1 in 100 people in Scotland
are autistic. Currently,
between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4
people diagnosed with autism are assigned female at birth (AFAB).
Read more about autism and gender
Autism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children.
Even if you aren’t diagnosed until adulthood, getting a diagnosis can be very helpful for identifying your strengths and the things you struggle with, and finding support.
Read more about characteristics of autism
Characteristics of autism
Every autistic person is different and has different experiences. However, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people.
The way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you’re in.
For example:
the way you use language and talk might be different to most people
you may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people
making and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you
you may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not
you might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently
autistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers
you may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes
you might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time – these interests can change throughout your life
you might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly
there might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can’t be around due to their texture or smell
when working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole – you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else’s part
while autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects
autistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up
you might find you’re always determined to make sure things are ‘perfect’, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you’re working on something
it can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn’t clear communication about what they’re expected to do
There are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic.
Read more about diagnosing autism here
Autism and gender
At the moment, men and those assigned male at birth are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth.
As more healthcare professionals now know what characteristics to look for, it’s becoming more common for women and those assigned female at birth to receive an autism diagnosis. However, recognising autism can take longer for women and those assigned female at birth. This is because the characteristics healthcare professionals look for are the same for everyone, but women and those assigned female at birth can often show these in slightly different ways. For example, they’re more likely to ‘mask’ autism – hiding autism characteristics and copying what other people without autism do – in order to fit into groups. This can make it harder to recognise that they might be autistic, and to receive a diagnosis.
Autism and environment
Some environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. Every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are:
social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’ on things like who speaks when – for example, parties and nights out
busy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at once
Many environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. When autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they’re likely to:
feel more relaxed
perform better at tasks
find it easier to learn
use less time and energy trying to fit in with their environment
Because every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. It may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid.
If there’s an autistic person in your life, it’s important to ask them what they’d prefer and if there’s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them.
If you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they’re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. Autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don’t enjoy.
Read more about finding the right environment
Diagnosing autism
The signs of autism can be different depending on the person and how old they are.
Because autism is present from birth, it can usually be diagnosed in childhood. However, it may only be recognised later in life. Understanding of autism has grown over time, so more people are now being diagnosed when they’re older if the signs weren’t recognised when they were children.
These are signs of autism that health professionals look for when making a diagnosis, but an autistic person may not have all of these signs. For example, delayed speech (learning to speak later than most children), or a child not speaking at all, can be a sign of autism. However, many autistic children talk at the same age a child without autism would.
It’s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren’t caused by autism.
If you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your GP or health visitor.
Signs of autism in children
The signs of autism can change as children grow – babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older.
Babies and toddlers
Signs of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour.
Talking and showing emotions
Autistic babies and toddlers might:
start talking later than most children
seem less aware of others around them – for example, they might not respond to their name being called
make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedly
Autistic babies and toddlers might not:
smile back when you smile at them
point to show when they want something
point to show you something they find interesting
share when they’re feeling happy – for example, they might be having fun playing, but they might not turn around and smile at you
Playing
Autistic babies and toddlers might:
spend a long time setting up toys in a certain way, and set them up the same way every time
enjoy lining toys up in order, or watching parts of them move
Autistic babies and toddlers might not:
seem interested in playing with other children their age
seem to use their toys to make up stories or pretend – they might also start pretend play at a later age than most children
Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes)
Autistic babies and toddlers might:
react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, if they like the way a stuffed toy feels, they want to spend a lot of time stroking the toy
become upset if given something to eat or drink that’s new to them
eat a limited range of foods
Children aged 4 and up
As children grow and experience different environments, such as nursery and school, the characteristics of autism can appear differently.
Communicating
Autistic children might:
speak differently to most children – for example, they might use an unusual accent, talk slowly or quickly compared to others, speak in a ‘flat’ tone that doesn’t change, or use a ‘sing-song’ voice
use longer or more complicated words than most children, even in relaxed situations
struggle to ask other people questions about themselves
find it hard to keep a conversation going
Relationships
Autistic children might:
show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest them, but experience significant difficulty when talking about other people’s interests
find it difficult to make and keep friends
want to play with other children, but find it hard to ask if they can join in
have 1 or 2 good friends that they spend a lot of time with
spend free time, such as school break times, by themselves
find it hard to tell the difference between someone being friendly or joking and someone trying to bully them or hurt their feelings
get on better with adults than other children their age
get on better with children who are younger or older than them
spend time with a group of children, but find it hard to join in with other children’s play, and so spend a lot of time on the edge of the group
have friends at school, but show little to no interest in seeing them outside of school
Different situations and routine
Autistic children might:
accidentally make social mistakes, for example correcting a teacher about classroom rules
find some social situations, like parties or busy places, overwhelming and difficult to cope with
be passive around other children or adults, agreeing to everything and doing everything people ask
often tell others what to do, including while playing
struggle with social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’, such as free play or school break times
find it difficult to cope with changes to their routine, especially if the change is unexpected – for example, having a different teacher for a day or having plans change due to bad weather
Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes)
Autistic children might:
react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, being unable to cope with seams in their socks or the noises in supermarkets
find certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes particularly calming or enjoyable – for example, coloured lights or being tucked tightly into bed
make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedly
Signs of autism in teenagers and adults
The characteristics of autism can affect you differently as you get older – you may also recognise some of the signs of autism in children in yourself as an adult. Many people are diagnosed with autism as teenagers or adults based on noticing that they think and behave differently from most other people.
Signs of autism in teenagers
As you age and experience different environments, you might notice different signs of autism.
Communicating
As an autistic teenager, you might:
find it hard to be understood in conversations,
find it hard to work out when to talk in conversations – you might never get to say what you want to say, or find yourself talking over other people
find it easier to communicate with other autistic people
be able to talk for a long time about the subjects that particularly interest you
show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest you, but experience significant difficulty when trying to talk about other people’s interests
be able to answer other people’s questions, but struggle to know what questions to ask or how to answer when someone tells you something about themselves
find other people say you use a lot of long words, or use longer or more complicated words than most people
often use the same phrases when you’re talking
struggle with hidden meanings when other people are talking to you – it might be difficult for you to understand a ‘hint’, or notice when someone is flirting with you
find people can take the wrong meaning from your words or behaviour – for example, if you make a lot of eye contact, they might think you’re flirting with them
Behaviour and different situations
As an autistic teenager, you might:
find eye contact uncomfortable, or struggle to know how much eye contact to use
do well when you’re in your routine, but find it difficult when routines change – changes might make you feel anxious, make it hard to concentrate, or mean you have to work harder on things it’d normally be easy to do
struggle to imagine things that you haven’t experienced before – for example, if you’re going to a party for the first time, it might be hard for you to imagine what will happen and what you’ll be expected to do
find yourself making social mistakes without realising why – for example, during conversations you might not realise there are things other people would rather not talk about, or don’t think are important to talk about
Learning and hobbies
As an autistic teenager, you might:
have a lot of knowledge on particular topics, and spend a lot of time learning about them and telling others about them
have a hobby you feel very passionate about and spend a lot of time on
find it hard to start a new activity but get very focused on it once you get started – you might be able to focus on it better than most people
find it difficult to stop doing an activity you’re very focused on, even if you need to move on to something else – you might forget to eat or sleep
Emotions and relationships
As an autistic teenager, you might:
spend a lot of time being careful to avoid making social mistakes, or trying to make sure you don’t accidentally hurt anyone’s feelings
find that other people struggle to understand your feelings from your face or tone of voice
find that your friends are often older or younger than you
find that your friends tend to be autistic people
have to ask people to explain idioms (phrases that say one thing, when they’re actually talking about something else), for example: “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it”, which means “we’ll talk about that problem later”
have a clear idea of right and wrong, and strong views on issues that are important to you – you might struggle to understand exceptions to rules, or ‘grey areas’
find a lot of people don’t understand your sense of humour, and you might not understand why their jokes are funny
be trusting, and find people can often take advantage of you
find it hard to work out when someone is being unkind
Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes)
As an autistic teenager, you might:
have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like gyms
have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying flashing, multi-coloured lights in nightclubs or how loud the music is at a concert
seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets
find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyable
Signs of autism in adults
As you age and experience different environments, life events, and circumstances, you might notice different signs of autism. You might also have developed coping strategies for environments you find difficult, changing the way you manage them.
Work and education
As an autistic adult, you might:
find it more difficult than most people to communicate in interviews – for example, talking about your skills – which can make it hard to get a job
find it more difficult than most people to keep a job – you may be good at your work, but it might be hard to have good relationships with colleagues and managers
have a lot of knowledge or feel very passionate about a subject that’s useful for your work or studies
find it difficult or frustrating when rules or ways of doing things don’t make sense to you
find it more difficult than most people would to work on a project or task that has unclear instructions for how to complete it
Relationships and being social
As an autistic adult, you might:
find socialising hard work – when others seem to have a lot of energy after meeting a group of friends, for example, you might feel exhausted
have had relationships with friends or partners end because you couldn’t understand how each other thought, behaved, and communicated
find dating challenging
prefer to be alone during breaks at work
find it difficult to make ‘small talk’ – meaning conversation about day-to-day things such as the weather – or understand the reasons for making small talk
enjoy spending time with other people, but find activities that don’t have clear ‘rules’ or a schedule – for example, going to parties or nightclubs – difficult because you aren’t sure what to do
prefer meeting up with people to do structured activities, like cooking or taking part in a shared hobby or interest
Hobbies and skills
As an autistic adult, you might:
have a lot of detailed knowledge about a particular topic or hobby and feel very passionate about it
find that the hobbies or topics you’re particularly passionate about have changed several times in your life
Communication and emotions
As an autistic adult, you might:
find other people often misunderstand you, or seem upset by things you say even if you don’t mean to upset them
find it hard to understand why people around you see a situation one way, and not the way you understand it
find change more difficult than most people do – things that disrupt your daily routine, like changes to your job or going on holiday, can make you feel stressed and anxious
Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes)
As an autistic adult, you might:
have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like busy buses or trains
have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying lying under a weighted blanket, or the loudness of the music at a concert
seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets
find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyable
Autistic traits and diagnosis
Autistic traits – meaning things that autistic people often do, think, and feel – are often shared by people who don’t have autism too. This doesn’t mean that everyone is ‘a little bit autistic’, or that autistic people don’t need support.
To be diagnosed with autism, a person has to have a lot of autistic traits from birth, and those traits need to have a big effect on their life. In order to be diagnosed with autism, those traits must cause what a healthcare professional would call ‘clinically significant difficulties’ in their day-to-day life. This means that they have difficulties with day-to-day life due to their autistic traits and need to use their own ways of overcoming those difficulties, or the people in their life need to help them to overcome them, or both.
Being in a supportive environment makes a big difference to an autistic person’s wellbeing and quality of life.

Other health conditions
People who have these conditions can be more likely to also have autism:
developmental disorders such as
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
or learning disability
muscular dystrophy
Down’s syndrome
cerebral palsy
epilepsy
neurofibromatosis – a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2)
rare genetic conditions, including fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome
Causes of autism
The exact cause of autism is unknown, but researchers think it’s at least partly genetic – that autism can run in the family. However, autism can also develop when there’s no family history. There’s no way to predict whether a child will be autistic, even if one or both of their parents are autistic.
More research is being done to find out which genes cause autism – it’s thought to be caused by more than one.
Living with autism
Like everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment – however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person.
Autism doesn’t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. However, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don’t have them.
Therapies for autistic people
There’s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn’t want to be ‘cured’ even if it was possible. Many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated.
Related conditions
Because of the difficulties they can experience, autistic people may need treatment or support for other conditions, including:
low mood
anxiety
sleep problems
Psychological therapies
like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are often used to treat depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, both in people who have autism and people who don’t.
Psychological therapies can help to manage conditions linked with autism, like anxiety, but psychological therapies aren’t a treatment for autism itself. Therapy techniques might need to be adapted to work for an autistic person.
Challenges in daily living
Depending on what’s offered by your NHS board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience.
Possible therapies include:
help with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives
groups for autistic people to share experiences and advice
sensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world
training courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible support
Finding the right therapies
Interventions that aim to ‘train out’ behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. However, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience – this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour.
For example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills.
These therapies don’t aim to change a person’s autism, but to give them skills they can use. If you’re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. If you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs.
Learn about avoiding harmful and unhelpful therapies for autism
Autism and your environment
Sometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed.
Meltdowns and shutdowns
When an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn’t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have ‘meltdowns’ or ‘shutdowns’.
It’s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn’t a tantrum. A tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. A meltdown or shutdown isn’t something an autistic person can control, and it’s caused by being overwhelmed.
During a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. This can include doing things like:
trying to get away from people – for example by running away or hiding
trying to get people away from them – for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressively
During a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out – for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them.
Read more about meltdowns
Challenging behaviour
Like everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they’re in the wrong environment. While it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating.
Behaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don’t have any other way to do so. It’s not ‘bad’ behaviour, or intended to cause harm. This kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs – for example, people with a learning disability.
If you’re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges.
If someone in your life is autistic, or you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there’s effective support for everyone involved.
Behaviour that challenges can also be caused by:
trying to meet sensory needs – for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls
wanting something – for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy
needing assistance or attention – for example, because they’re bored or want help with a project at school
trying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the road
Behaviour that people can find challenging includes:
being destructive – breaking things, for example
being disruptive – making noise in class or throwing things, for example
self-harm
aggression
Help is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. Finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. Contact
your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you for
advice.
Getting the right environment
Environment is important to quality of life for autistic people. There are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child.
The social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. These barriers can be physical – for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. Barriers can also be caused by people’s attitudes – for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don’t make eye contact while talking.
The social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them.
Learn more about the social model of disability
Autism is covered by the Equality Act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make “reasonable adjustments” to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work.
Learn more about the Equality Act (2010)
Common changes to an environment that can help autistic people include:
sensory changes – for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working
communication changes – for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words
routine – keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possible
Every autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes – the best way to find the right ones is to ask an autistic person, or in the case of a child, their parents or caregivers.

Facts and myths about autism
There are many incorrect beliefs about autism, particularly the causes of autism or the best ways to overcome the challenges often faced by autistic people.
Causes
These things do not cause autism:
bad parenting
vaccines, or any ingredients in vaccines
trauma or distress at a young age
diet
infections
Fake treatments
There’s no cure for autism, but many people incorrectly believe there are ways to cure it, or to change the way autistic people experience and interact with the world.
Some fake treatments are dangerous – even the ones that aren’t dangerous are unethical, and none of them are helpful.
Harmful and dangerous fake treatments include:
any treatment that aims to ‘train out’ autistic behaviours, like forcing someone to stop making repetitive movements
any treatment that aims to train autistic people to do things that cause them distress, in an attempt to change their behaviour and remove autistic characteristics
hyperbaric oxygen therapy – treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber
chelation therapy, which uses medication or other methods to remove metal from the body
chlorine dioxide (CD), also called Mineral Miracle Solution (MMS) – this is a bleach solution given via enema which can cause severe distress and physical harm
neurofeedback – where an autistic person’s brain activity is monitored, usually by placing electrodes on their head, so they can see their brain activity on a screen and be told how to change it
facilitated communication – where a therapist or another person supports and guides an autistic person’s hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse
auditory integration training – this involves an autistic person listening to music that has changes in tone, pitch, and volume
There are some treatments that don’t have any evidence to suggest they’re helpful, but also don’t have evidence to suggest they’re harmful as long as they’re done safely. These include special diets, such as gluten-free or casein-free diets. Any special diet should only be done under the supervision of a dietician or nutritionist.
If you hear about a treatment that you want to try, always talk to your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you or your child first.
Spotting fake treatments
There are a number of ways to identify a fake treatment. People, organisations, or websites that promote fake treatments usually:
claim to ‘cure’ autism or help people ‘recover’ from autism
claim the treatment works quickly or instantly
claim the treatment can be done at home by anyone, and you don’t need training or qualifications
claim you can’t trust doctors to be honest with you, or say “doctors don’t want you to know about this”
ask autistic people, or parents of children with autism, to rely on their knowledge of their body or their child’s body instead of considering scientific evidence that can tell you whether a treatment is harmful or helpful
have no scientific evidence to prove they work, such as peer-reviewed studies or information from the NHS
mainly use personal stories as evidence that they work, which makes it hard to tell if the stories are true
advertise themselves with words like ‘miracle’, ‘faith’, and ‘trust’, or use religious phrases
charge a lot of money, and often require money to be paid on a regular basis
promote treatments for autism that aren’t available on the NHS, or claim to be ‘experimental’
Healthcare professionals have put together information on what treatments are safe and unsafe, and on ways to support autistic people effectively. If you’re unsure about any treatment, ask your GP or the healthcare professional who supports you or your child.

report them to Trading Standards
.
If you see an advert for a fake treatment in the media, on a website or on social media, you can contact the
Advertising Standards Authority

About bladder cancer
Bladder cancer is where a growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles.
The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless.
If you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.
Read about the
symptoms of bladder cancer
Types of bladder cancer
Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has spread.
If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases. Most people don’t die as a result of this type of bladder cancer.
When the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it’s referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is less common, but has a higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal.
If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it’s known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.

diagnosing bladder cancer
Why does bladder cancer happen?
Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder’s cells over many years.
Tobacco smoke is a common cause and it’s estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking.
Contact with certain chemicals previously used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since been banned.
Read more about the
causes of bladder cancer
and
preventing bladder cancer
Treating bladder cancer
In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it’s usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact.
This is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
In cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy.
When the bladder is removed, you’ll need another way of collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy.
If it’s possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery is not suitable, a course of
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy.
After treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you’ll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence.

treating bladder cancer
Who is affected?
Bladder cancer is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed in people aged 75 and over.
Bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the manufacturing industry.
Symptoms of bladder cancer
Blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.
The medical name for this is haematuria and it’s usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn’t always noticeable and it may come and go.
Less common symptoms of bladder cancer include:
a need to urinate on a more frequent basis
sudden urges to urinate
a burning sensation when passing urine
If bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include:
pelvic pain
bone pain
unintentional weight loss
swelling of the legs
When to seek medical advice
If you ever have blood in your urine – even if it comes and goes – you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.
Having blood in your urine doesn’t mean you definitely have bladder cancer. There are other, more common, causes including:
a
urinary tract infection
, such as
cystitis
a
kidney infection
kidney stones
urethritis
an
enlarged prostate gland
, in men
Causes of bladder cancer
Bladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. It’s often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn’t always known.
What is cancer?
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
Increased risk
Several factors have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer.
Smoking
Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. This is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals.
If you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys into your urine. The bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. This can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may lead to bladder cancer.
It’s estimated that just over a third of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. People who smoke may be up to four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers.
Exposure to chemicals
Exposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. Previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases.
Chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include:
aniline dyes
2-Naphthylamine
4-Aminobiphenyl
xenylamine
benzidine
o-toluidine
Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:
dyes
textiles
rubbers
paints
plastics
leather tanning
Some non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes.
The link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above have been banned.
However, these chemicals are still linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to 30 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop.
Other risk factors
Other factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include:
radiotherapy
to treat previous cancers near the bladder, such as
bowel cancer
previous treatment with certain
chemotherapy
medications, such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin
previous surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, during treatment for
benign prostate enlargement
having diabetes – bladder cancer is thought to be linked to certain treatments for
type 2 diabetes
having a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis
long-term or repeated
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
long-term
bladder stones
having an early
menopause
(before the age of 42)
an untreated infection called
schistosomiasis
, which is caused by a parasite that lives in fresh water – this is very rare in the UK
How does bladder cancer spread?
Bladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. In some cases, it may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. If the cancer penetrates this muscle, it can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system.
If bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it’s known as metastatic bladder cancer.
Diagnosing bladder cancer
If you have symptoms of bladder cancer, such as blood in your urine, you should speak to your GP.
Your GP may ask about your symptoms, family history and whether you’ve been exposed to any possible causes of bladder cancer, such as smoking.
In some cases, your GP may request a urine sample, so it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells.
Your GP may also carry out a physical examination of your rectum and vagina, as bladder cancer sometimes causes a noticeable lump that presses against them.
If your doctor suspects bladder cancer, you’ll be referred to a hospital for further tests.
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. Find out
who should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer
.
At the hospital
Some hospitals have specialist clinics for people with blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems.
Cystoscopy
If you’re referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered a
cystoscopy
.
This procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate). A cystoscope is a thin tube with a camera and light at the end.
Before having a cystoscopy, a
local anaesthetic
gel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so you don’t feel any pain. The gel also helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily.
The procedure usually takes about 5 minutes.
Imaging scans
You may be offered a
CT scan
or an
MRI scan
if the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder.
An intravenous (IV) urogram may also be used to look at your whole urinary system before or after treatment for bladder cancer.
During this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system.
Transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT)
If abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as TURBT. This is so any abnormal areas of tissue can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy).
TURBT is carried out under
general anaesthetic
.
Sometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within 6 weeks of the first
biopsy
.
You should also be offered a dose of
chemotherapy
after the operation. This may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning if the removed cells are found to be cancerous.
See
treating bladder cancer
for more information about the TURBT procedure
Staging and grading
Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is.
Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. Lower-stage cancers are smaller and have a better chance of successful treatment.
Grading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread. The grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from G1 to G3. High-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers.
The most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the TNM system, where:
T stands for how far into the bladder the tumour has grown
N stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes
M stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs
T stages
The T staging system is as follows:
TIS or CIS (carcinoma in situ) – a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining
Ta – the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining
T1 – the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder lining
Bladder cancer up to the T1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
If the tumour grows larger than this, it’s usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as:
T2 – the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle
T3 – the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fat
If the tumour grows larger than the T3 stage, it’s considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as:
T4 – the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organs
N stages
The N staging system is as follows:
N0 – there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes
N1 – there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis
N2 – there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis
N3 – there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your groin
M stages
There are only two options in the M system:
M0 – where the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body
M1 – where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liver
The TNM system can be difficult to understand, so don’t be afraid to ask your care team questions about your test results and what they mean for your treatment and outlook.
Treating bladder cancer
The treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is.
Treatments usually differ between early stage, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and more advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)
All hospitals use MDTs to treat bladder cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Members of your MDT may include:
a urologist – a surgeon specialising in treating conditions affecting the urinary tract
a clinical oncologist – a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy
a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue
a radiologist – a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniques
You should be given the contact details for a clinical nurse specialist, who will be in contact with all members of your MDT. They’ll be able to answer questions and support you throughout your treatment.
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your MDT will make recommendations, but remember that the final decision is yours.
Before discussing your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your MDT.
Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
If you’ve been diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages CIS, Ta and T1), your recommended treatment plan depends on the risk of the cancer returning or spreading beyond the lining of your bladder.
This risk is calculated using a series of factors, including:
the number of tumours present in your bladder
whether the tumours are larger than 3cm (1 inch) in diameter
whether you’ve had bladder cancer before
the grade of the cancer cells
These treatments are discussed in more detail below.
Low-risk
Low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy when tissue samples are taken for testing (see
diagnosing bladder cancer
).
TURBT is carried out under
general anaesthetic
. The surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. The wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given a
catheter
to drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days.
After surgery, you may be given a single dose of
chemotherapy
, directly into your bladder, using a catheter. The solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away.
Most people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having TURBT and are able to resume normal physical activity within 2 weeks.
You should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months and nine months to check your bladder, using a
cystoscopy
. If your cancer returns after 6 months and is small, you may be offered a treatment called fulguration. This involves using an electric current to destroy the cancer cells.
Intermediate-risk
People with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least 6 doses of chemotherapy. The liquid is placed directly into your bladder, using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away.
You should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months, 9 months, 18 months, then once every year. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. If your cancer returns within 5 years, you’ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.
Some residue of the chemotherapy medication may be left in your urine after treatment, which could severely irritate your skin. It helps if you urinate while sitting down and that you’re careful not to splash yourself or the toilet seat. After passing urine, wash the skin around your genitals with soap and water.
If you’re sexually active, it’s important to use a barrier method of
contraception
, such as a condom. This is because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation.
You also shouldn’t try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects.
High-risk
People with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second TURBT operation, within 6 weeks of the initial investigation (see
diagnosing bladder cancer
). A
CT scan
or an
MRI scan
may also be required.
Your urologist and clinical nurse specialist will discuss your treatment options with you, which will either be:
a course of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment – using a variant of the
BCG vaccine
an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy)
The BCG vaccine is passed into your bladder through a catheter and left for 2 hours before being drained away. Most people require weekly treatments over a 6-week period. Common side effects of BCG include:
a frequent need to urinate
pain when urinating
blood in your urine (haematuria)
flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, fever and aching
urinary tract infections
If BCG treatment doesn’t work, or the side effects are too strong, you’ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.
You should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then once a year. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.
If you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will need to create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). Your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created.
Read about the
complications of bladder cancer surgery
for more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery.
After having a cystectomy, you should be offered follow-up appointments including a CT scan at six and 12 months, and blood tests once a year. Men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for 5 years.
Muscle-invasive bladder cancer
The recommended treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. With T2 and T3 bladder cancer, treatment aims to cure the condition if possible, or at least control it for a long time.
Your urologist, oncologist and clinical nurse specialist will discuss your treatment options with you, which will either be:
an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) – see above
radiotherapy
with a radiosensitiser
Your oncologist should also discuss the possibility of having chemotherapy before either of these treatments (neoadjuvant therapy), if it’s suitable for you.
Radiotherapy with a radiosensitiser
Radiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). Sessions are usually given on a daily basis for 5 days a week over the course of 4 to 7 weeks. Each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.
A radiosensitiser should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. It has a much smaller effect on normal tissue.
As well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. These include:
diarrhoea
inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)
tightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful
erectile dysfunction (in men)
loss of pubic hair
infertility
tiredness
difficulty passing urine
Most of these side effects should pass a few weeks after your treatment finishes, although there’s a chance they’ll be permanent.
Having radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you’ll be infertile for the rest of your life. However, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn’t usually a problem.
After having radiotherapy for bladder cancer, you should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and every year after that. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.
You may also be offered CT scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. A CT scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for 5 years.
Surgery or radiotherapy?
Your MDT may recommend a specific treatment because of your individual circumstances.
For example, someone with a small bladder or many existing urinary symptoms is better suited to surgery. Someone who has a single bladder tumour with normal bladder function is better suited for treatments that preserve the bladder.
However, your input is also important, so you should discuss which treatment is best for you with your MDT.
There are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy.
The pros of having a radical cystectomy include:
treatment is carried out in one go
you won’t need regular cystoscopies after treatment, although other less invasive tests may be needed
The cons of having a radical cystectomy include:
it can take up to 3 months to fully recover
a risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding
a risk of complications from the use of general anaesthetic
an alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag
a high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%) as a result of nerve damage
after surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller
a small chance of a fatal complication, such as a
heart attack
,
stroke
or
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
The pros of having radiotherapy include:
there’s no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health
your bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn’t removed
there’s less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%)
The cons of having radiotherapy include:
you’ll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for 4 to 7 weeks
short-term side effects are common, such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)
a small chance of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating
women may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortable
Chemotherapy
In some cases, chemotherapy may be used during treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Instead of medication being put directly into your bladder, it’s put into a vein in your arm. This is called intravenous chemotherapy and can be used:
before radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours
in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)
to slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy)
There isn’t enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is an effective treatment when it’s given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning. It’s usually only used this way as part of a
clinical trial
. See
clinical trials for bladder cancer
for more information.
Chemotherapy is usually given over a few consecutive days at first. You’ll then have a few weeks off to allow your body to recover before the treatment begins again. This cycle will be repeated for a few months.
As the chemotherapy medication is being injected into your blood, you’ll experience a wider range of side effects than if you were having chemotherapy directly into the bladder. These side effects should stop after the treatment has finished.
Chemotherapy weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It’s important to report any symptoms of a potential infection, such as a high temperature, persistent cough or reddening of the skin, to your MDT. Avoid close contact with people who are known to have an infection.
Other side effects of chemotherapy can include:
nausea
vomiting
hair loss
lack of appetite
tiredness
Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer
The recommended treatment plan for locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. Your oncologist should discuss your treatment options with you, which may include:
a course of chemotherapy
treatments to relieve cancer symptoms
Chemotherapy
If you receive a course of chemotherapy, you’ll be given a combination of drugs to help relieve the side effects of treatment. Treatment may be stopped if chemotherapy isn’t helping, or a second course may be offered.
Relieving cancer symptoms
You may be offered treatment to relieve any cancer symptoms. This may include:
radiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area
treatment to drain your kidneys, if they become blocked and cause lower back pain
Palliative care
If your cancer is at an advanced stage and can’t be cured, your MDT should discuss how the cancer will progress and which treatments are available to ease the symptoms.
You can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief.

end of life care
Complications of bladder cancer
A diagnosis of bladder cancer, and some treatments for the condition, can have a significant impact on your life.
Emotional impact
The emotional impact of living with bladder cancer can be huge. Many people report experiencing a kind of ‘rollercoaster’ effect. For example, you may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, up when the cancer is removed, and down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.
This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger feelings of
depression
. Signs that you may be depressed include:
having continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness
no longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoy
Contact your GP for advice if you think you may be depressed. There’s a range of relatively successful treatments for depression, including
antidepressant medication
and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

coping with cancer
Urinary diversion
If your bladder is removed, an alternative way of passing urine out of your body will be created during the operation. This is called urinary diversion.
There are various types of urinary diversion, which are described below. In some cases, you may be able to make a choice based on your personal preferences. However, certain treatment options will not be suitable for everyone.
Your multidisciplinary team (MDT) can provide information on the most suitable options for you.
Urostomy
A urostomy is carried out during a radical cystectomy. A small section of the small bowel is removed and connected to your ureters (the 2 tubes that normally carry urine out of the kidneys).
The surgeon then creates a small hole in the surface of your abdomen and the open end of the removed bowel is placed in this hole, creating an opening known as a stoma.
A special waterproof bag is placed over the stoma to collect urine. A stoma nurse will teach you how to care for your stoma, and how and when to change the bag.
Continent urinary diversion
Continent urinary diversion is similar to a urostomy, but without an external bag. Instead, a section of your bowel is used to create a pouch inside your body that stores urine.
The ureters are connected to the pouch and the pouch is connected to an opening in the abdominal wall. A valve in the opening (stoma) prevents urine leaking out.
The pouch is emptied using a thin, flexible tube (catheter). Most people need to empty their pouch about 4 or 5 times a day.
Bladder reconstruction
In some cases it may be possible to create a new bladder, known as a neobladder. This involves removing a section of your bowel and reconstructing it into a balloon-like sac, before connecting it to your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) at one end and your ureters at the other end. However, bladder reconstruction isn’t suitable for everyone.
You’ll be taught how to empty your neobladder by relaxing the muscles in your pelvis, while tightening the muscles in your abdomen at the same time.
Your neobladder won’t contain the same types of nerve endings as a real bladder, so you won’t get the distinctive sensation that tells you to pass urine. Some people experience a feeling of fullness inside their abdomen, while others have reported they feel like they need to pass wind.
Because of the loss of normal nerve function, most people with a neobladder experience some episodes of
urinary incontinence
, which usually occurs during the night, while they’re asleep.
You may find it useful to empty your neobladder at set times during the day, including before you go to bed, to help prevent incontinence.
Sexual problems
Erectile dysfunction
Contact your MDT if you lose the ability to obtain or maintain an erection after a radical cystectomy. It may be possible for you to be treated with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.
PDE5s are sometimes combined with a device called a vacuum pump, which consists of a cylinder connected to a pump. The penis is placed inside the cylinder and the air is pumped out. This creates a vacuum that causes blood to flow into the penis. A rubber ring is then placed around the base of the penis, which allows an erection to be maintained for around 30 minutes.

treating erectile dysfunction
Narrowing of the vagina
Both radiotherapy and cystectomy can cause a woman’s vagina to become shortened and narrowed, which can make penetrative sex painful or difficult.
There are 2 main treatment options available if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to the area, which should help to increase moisture inside your vagina.
The second is to use vaginal dilators. These are plastic cone-shaped devices of various sizes that are designed to gently stretch your vagina and make it more supple.
It’s usually recommended that you use dilators for a 5 to 10-minute period every day, starting with the dilator that fits in easiest first and gradually increasing the size, as your vagina stretches over the following weeks.
Many women find this an embarrassing issue to discuss, but the use of dilators is a well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide more information and advice.
You may find that the more often you have penetrative sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.
The Macmillan Cancer Support website has information and a video about
cancer and sexuality
Preventing bladder cancer
It’s not always possible to prevent bladder cancer, but some risk factors have been identified, which may increase your risk of developing the condition.
Stopping smoking
If you smoke, giving up is the best way to reduce your risk of developing bladder cancer and preventing it from recurring.
If you decide to stop smoking, you could contact the Quit Your Way Scotland service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). The specially trained helpline staff will offer you free expert advice and encouragement.
If you’re committed to giving up smoking, but don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.
For more information and advice about giving up smoking, have a browse through
stop smoking treatments
and the
stop smoking home page
.
Workplace safety
Your risk of bladder cancer could be increased if your job involves exposure to certain chemicals. Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:
rubber
dyes
textiles
plastic
leather tanning
diesel fumes
Nowadays, there are rigorous safety protocols in place designed to minimise your risk of exposure, and chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer have been banned. If you’re uncertain about what these protocols involve, talk to your line manager or health and safety representative.
If you’re concerned that your employer may be disregarding recommendations about workplace safety, you should contact the
Health and Safety Executive
for advice.
Diet
There’s some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in fat can help to prevent bladder cancer.
Even though this evidence is limited, it’s a good idea to follow this type of healthy diet, as it can help to prevent other types of cancer, such as
bowel cancer
, as well as serious health conditions, including
high blood pressure (hypertension)
,
stroke
and
heart disease
.
A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. Limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day (1 teaspoon) because too much can increase your blood pressure.
You should try to avoid foods that contain saturated fat, as it can increase your cholesterol levels.
Foods high in saturated fat include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter
ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)
lard
cream
hard cheese
cakes and biscuits
foods that contain coconut or palm oil
However, a balanced diet should include a small amount of unsaturated fat, because this will actually help to control your cholesterol levels.
Foods high in unsaturated fat include:
oily fish
avocados
nuts and seeds
sunflower, rapeseed, olive and vegetable oils

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/bacterial-vaginosis/,"Bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted infection. It’s an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in the vagina.
Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis
Often there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Some women may notice a change in the normal discharge from the vagina.
This discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.
Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation.
What to do if you think you may have bacterial vaginosis
Check if you could be triggering it with
toiletries
.
Consider over the counter treatments from your
pharmacy
.
Contact your GP practice for an appointment or
book an appointment at your local sexual health service
.
What does a bacterial vaginosis test involve?
Sometimes treatment is given based on symptoms without the need for an examination or test.
Sometimes a diagnosis can be made straightaway because of how the discharge looks. Sometimes the sample will be sent to a lab for testing.
You are more likely to need a test if you have frequent episodes of discharge.
Your nurse or doctor may perform an internal examination to check your vagina for signs of bacterial vaginosis. They may use a swab to collect a sample of the discharge from your vagina.
A swab looks a bit like a cotton bud and collecting a sample only takes a few minutes. It’s not painful, but it may be a little uncomfortable for a moment.
If your nurse or doctor suspects you are at risk of an STI they may do more tests.
Treatment for bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics must be prescribed by a doctor or nurse. You may be given an antibiotic cream or gel to use in your vagina, instead of antibiotic tablets by mouth.
While you’re there, make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you:
are pregnant
think you might be pregnant
are breastfeeding
These may affect the type of treatment you’re given.
You can still have sex while being treated for bacterial vaginosis as it’s not sexually transmitted. However antibiotics and creams can affect condoms and other forms of contraception. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist who can give you further information.
Partners do not usually need treatment.
Non-antibiotic treatment is also available to buy in
pharmacies
.
What causes bacterial vaginosis?
Bacteria called lactobacilli naturally live in your vagina and stop other bacteria from growing there.
Sometimes the balance of these bacteria changes. If this happens you can develop bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis can’t be passed on. But it’s more common in sexually active people.
Other things that may increase the risk of getting it include:
having a new sexual partner
having multiple sexual partners
smoking
using scented soaps or perfumed bubble bath
putting antiseptic liquids in the bath
douching (washing or cleaning out the vagina with water or other fluids)
using vaginal washes or deodorant
using strong detergents to wash your underwear
receiving oral sex
How to prevent bacterial vaginosis
The causes of bacterial vaginosis are not fully understood, so it may not be possible to completely prevent it. However, you may be able to lower your risk of developing it by
following our genital washing advice

About bile duct cancer
Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer.
The bile duct system, or ‘biliary’ system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods.
Symptoms of bile duct cancer
In most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can include:
jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine
unintentional weight loss
abdominal pain
Speak to your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked.
Read more about the
symptoms of bile duct cancer
Why does bile duct cancer happen?
The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common include being over 65 years old or having a rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
Read more about the
causes of bile duct cancer
Types of bile duct cancer
There are 2 main types of bile duct cancer, depending on where the cancer begins:
cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer
cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer
Diagnosis
Cancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including:
blood tests
ultrasound scans
computerised tomography (CT) scans
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
For some of these tests, you may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts.
You may also need a
biopsy
. This involves removing a small sample of tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone.
Read more about
diagnosing bile duct cancer
How is bile duct cancer treated?
Cancer of the bile duct can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven’t spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct may be removed.
Only a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. This is because symptoms usually develop at a late stage.
Despite this, treatment such as
chemotherapy
can relieve the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition.
Read more about
treating bile duct cancer
Who is affected?
Most cases of bile duct cancer occur in people over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally.
Can bile duct cancer be prevented?
There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it.
The most effective ways of achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as
cirrhosis
is a risk factor, and trying to ensure that you don’t become infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
Read more about
preventing bile duct cancer
Symptoms of bile duct cancer
Bile duct cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked.
In most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time.
The blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as:
jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine
unintentional weight loss
abdominal pain – most people feel a dull ache in the upper right-hand side of their abdomen (stomach)
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above and shivering
loss of appetite
When to seek medical advice
Always visit your GP if you have jaundice. While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis.
Causes of bile duct cancer
The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition.
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.
Increased risk
A number of factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified.
Age
Your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. Most people with the condition are over 65 years old.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare type of liver disease that causes long-lasting (chronic) inflammation of the liver.
It usually occurs in people aged 30 to 50. Up to 10% of people with
ulcerative colitis
(inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have PSC.
Around 10 to 20% of people with PSC will develop bile duct cancer. Your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have PSC and you smoke.
Bile duct abnormalities
Some people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct. These cysts are usually congenital, which means they are present from birth.
The most common types are choledochal cysts and Caroli’s disease, but both conditions are very rare.
Up to 20% of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct.
Biliary stones
Biliary stones are similar to
gallstones
, except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder.
Biliary stones are rare in western Europe, but are relatively common in parts of Asia, such as Japan and Taiwan. It’s estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer.
Parasitic infection
Liver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. You can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs.
Liver fluke infections are usually only a problem in Asia (especially Thailand) and Africa, where liver flukes are more widespread.
Exposure to toxins
Exposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer.
For example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. Thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood.
Other toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include:
asbestos – a fire-resistant material that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) – a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been banned
Other factors
The following factors are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed:
hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
cirrhosis
(a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
HIV
diabetes
obesity
smoking
Diagnosing bile duct cancer
Bile duct cancer can be a challenging condition to diagnose. You usually need several different tests before an accurate diagnosis can be made.
Blood tests
In bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain chemicals that can be detected using
blood tests
. These are known as tumour markers.
However, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions. A positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean you don’t.
Scans
A number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. These scans include:
ultrasound scan
– high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body
computer tomography (CT) scan
– a series of X-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liver
Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)
Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on an
X-ray
scanner.
A special dye is injected and the X-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. The endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct that could be the result of bile duct cancer.
A short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.
Spyglass
An advanced form of ERCP is a special test called a spyglass. This involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. It also enables a biopsy to be taken.
While this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. Therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed X-ray image of your bile duct.
The side of your abdomen (tummy) is numbed using
local anaesthetic
, and a special dye that shows up on X-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct.
As with ECRP, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. PTC and ECRP are both useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer.
Biopsy
If scans indicate that you may have bile duct cancer, a
biopsy
may be carried out to confirm a diagnosis.
During a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.
A biopsy is usually performed while ERCP or PTC is being carried out. As well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. This is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system.
Staging
A widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. The stages are:
stage 1A – the cancer is contained inside the bile duct
stage 1B – the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes
stage 2 – the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes
stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes and major blood vessels that supply the liver
stage 4 – the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungs

Most cases of bile duct cancer cannot be cured. Instead, treatment is most commonly used to relieve symptoms.
Cancer treatment team
Due to the rarity of bile duct cancer, you are likely to be referred to a specialist hepatobiliary unit with experience in treating the condition.
A multidisciplinary team (MDT) made up of different specialists will help you decide on your treatment, but the final decision will be yours. Your MDT may include:
a liver surgeon – a specialist in treating cancers of the liver
a medical or clinical oncologist – a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer using techniques such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy
a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue
a radiologist – a specialist in radiological diagnosis and intervention
a cancer nurse – who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team
a gastroenterologist – a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary disease
Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Your treatment plan
Your recommended treatment plan will be determined by your general health and the
stage the cancer has reached
.
In cases of stage 1 and stage 2 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder.
In cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. A cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes.
In cases of stage 4 bile duct cancer, achieving a successful cure is highly unlikely. However, stenting, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can often be used to help relieve the symptoms.
Your treatment plan may also be different if you have intrahepatic bile duct cancer, as this is usually treated in a similar way to liver cancer. Read more about
treating liver cancer
.
A number of experimental treatments may be available as part of a clinical trial.
Surgery
If your MDT thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. Depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove:
the part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells
your gallbladder
nearby lymph nodes
a large part of your liver
After surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still flow into the intestine.
Similarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. The liver can also regenerate itself after surgery.
You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home.
Success rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery.
Unblocking the bile duct
If your bile duct becomes blocked as a result of cancer, treatment to unblock it may be recommended. This will help resolve symptoms such as:
jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes
itchy skin
abdominal (tummy) pain
Unblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver.
The bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent. The stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again.
A stent can be inserted using either:
a variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct
a variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal wall
Occasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. If this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is not a standard treatment for bile duct cancer, but may help to relieve the symptoms, slow the spread of the cancer and prolong life. The types of radiotherapy are used to treat bile duct cancer:
external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct
internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumour
Radiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. However, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. Side effects of radiotherapy include:
nausea (feeling sick)
vomiting
fatigue (severe tiredness)
Read more about
radiotherapy
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is used in a similar way to radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms of cancer, slow down the rate it spreads and prolong life. It is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy.
Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. Side effects of chemotherapy can include:
nausea
vomiting
fatigue
hair loss
However, these side effects should stop once the course of treatment has finished. Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.
Read more about
chemotherapy
Clinical trials and experimental treatments
The treatments for bile duct cancer are not as effective as treatments for other types of cancer. Therefore, a number of clinical trials are being conducted to find better ways of treating the condition.
For example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer.
Targeted therapies
Another promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies are medications that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce.
In studies for some cancers, a medication called sorafenib has proved reasonably effective. Sorafenib works by blocking a protein that cancerous cells need to create a blood supply. However, sorafenib is not currently used as a routine treatment for bile duct cancer.
As bile duct cancer is a rare condition, there is a possibility you may be invited to take part in a clinical trial looking at the use of these types of experimental treatments.
All clinical trials are carried out under strict ethical guidelines based on the principles of patient care. However, there is no guarantee that the treatment you receive during a clinical trial will be more effective, or even as effective, as existing treatments.

Preventing bile duct cancer
There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, although it is possible to reduce your chances of developing the condition.
The 3 most effective steps to reduce your chances of developing bile duct cancer are:
giving up smoking (if you smoke)
drinking alcohol in moderation
minimising your exposure to the
hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
viruses
Stopping smoking
Not smoking is the most effective way of preventing bile duct cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as
stroke
,
heart attack
and
lung cancer
.
It is particularly important to stop smoking if you have the liver condition known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). If you have PSC, smoking will significantly increase your chances of developing bile duct cancer.
Your GP can advise on how to give up smoking. They can also recommend and prescribe suitable medication. You can get more information and advice from the
Quit Your Way Scotland
advice and support service.
Read more about
stopping smoking
Alcohol
If you are a heavy drinker, reducing your alcohol intake will help prevent liver damage
(cirrhosis)
. This may, in turn, reduce your risk of developing bile duct cancer.
Reducing your alcohol consumption is particularly important if you have a pre-existing liver condition, such as PSC or hepatitis B or C.
Read low-risk drinking guidelines
Visit your GP if you are finding it difficult to moderate your alcohol consumption. Counselling and medication are available to help reduce the amount you drink.
Read more about
alcohol
Hepatitis C
If you regularly inject drugs, the best way to avoid getting hepatitis C is to never share any of your drug-injecting equipment with others.
You should also avoid sharing any object that could be contaminated with blood, such as razors and toothbrushes.
There is less risk of getting hepatitis C by having sex with someone who is infected. However, as a precaution it is best to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, with a new partner.
Read more about
preventing hepatitis C
Hepatitis B
A vaccine is available that provides immunisation against
hepatitis B
.
Vaccination would usually only be recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as:
people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs
people who change their sexual partner frequently
people travelling to or from a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread
healthcare workers who may have come into contact with the virus
Pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B. If they are infected, their baby can be vaccinated shortly after birth to prevent them also becoming infected.

hepatitis B vaccination
The liver fluke
The liver fluke is a major cause of bile duct cancer in Asia. It is a parasite which, after infection, damages the tissue of the bile duct and in some cases triggers the onset of bile duct cancer.
The liver fluke is widespread in Thailand. Other countries where the liver fluke can be found include:
Cambodia
Laos
Vietnam
Infection occurs after eating raw or undercooked fish contaminated by fluke eggs.
Always ensure any fish you eat is cooked thoroughly when travelling in these countries."

About benign prostate enlargement
Benign prostate enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a condition that affects older men and anyone with a prostate.
It’s particularly common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age and isn’t usually a serious threat to health.
Prostate gland
The prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It’s involved in the production of semen.
The prostate produces a thick, white fluid that’s made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen.
If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine and may cause:
difficulty starting urination
a frequent need to urinate
difficulty fully emptying the bladder
In some men and anyone with a prostate, the symptoms are mild and don’t require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person’s quality of life.
Read more about the
symptoms of benign prostate enlargement
Many people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing
prostate cancer
. This isn’t the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an enlarged prostate.
What causes benign prostate enlargement?
The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it’s linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older.
Read more about the
causes of benign prostate enlargement
How is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed?
If your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you’ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms.
Each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms.
Your GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.
You may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a blood test that measures PSA.
Read more about
diagnosing benign prostate enlargement
Treating benign prostate enlargement
Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.
If you have mild to moderate symptoms, you won’t receive any immediate medical treatment, but you’ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.
You’ll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and
alcohol
intake, and
exercising regularly
, to see if they improve your symptoms.
As well as lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms.
Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement.
Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.

Complications of benign prostate enlargement
Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare.
Read more about the
complications of benign prostate enlargement
How common is benign prostate enlargement?
Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.
Symptoms of benign prostate enlargement
The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).
This can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can:
make it difficult for you to start urinating
weaken the flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’
cause you to strain to pass urine
cause you to need to urinate frequently
cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate
cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in
urinary incontinence
if you can’t find a toilet quickly enough
cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully
cause blood in the urine (haematuria)
In the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as bladder stones, bladder infections and kidney damage.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to, your usual pattern of urination. Even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated.
Any blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions.
Causes of benign prostate enlargement
The exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition’s development.
Hormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body.
One theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.
Another theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It’s been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.
Risk factors
Research has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate with
high blood pressure
and
diabetes
. However, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.
Diagnosing benign prostate enlargement
To find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you’ll need to have a few tests.
Some tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems).
First, your GP will ask about your symptoms. If it seems that you have
symptoms of benign prostate enlargement
, the next stage is to calculate your International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
You’ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. Each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score is used to assess the severity of your symptoms.
The checklist includes the following questions.
Over the past month, how often:
have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating?
have you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after finishing urinating?
have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating?
have you found it difficult to postpone urination?
have you had a weak stream of urine?
have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night?
have you had to get up during the night to urinate?
After your GP has assessed the severity your symptoms, they’ll aim to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms using certain tests.
Ruling out other conditions
The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions, including
prostate cancer
. Therefore, your GP will need to be completely sure that your symptoms aren’t caused by cancer.
Urine tests
A urine test can be used to check whether your symptoms are caused by an infection in your urinary system, such as a
kidney infection
or bladder infection.
Rectal examination
You may need a rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy.
Your GP will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. As the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they’ll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. The procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn’t usually painful.
Prostate cancer doesn’t always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. You will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
A blood test can be used to measure the amount of the PSA protein that’s produced by the prostate.
A raised PSA level indicates enlargement of the prostate, and a significantly raised level may indicate prostate cancer. However, as with a rectal examination, a PSA test can’t provide a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
A TRUS is a type of
ultrasound scan
specifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area.
An ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate.
This type of scan measures the size of your prostate and can be used to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Computer tomographic (CT) urogram
A CT urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra).
A CT urogram can be used to check for blockages in your urinary system that could be causing your symptoms, such as a
kidney stone
or bladder stone. It can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract.
During a CT urogram, you’ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible on
X-rays
. After 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of X-rays will be taken. In some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final X-ray is taken.
Voiding charts
A voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. You’ll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate – for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it’s difficult to start urinating.
A voiding chart is a good way of finding out more information about your symptoms and can be used to determine the type of treatment that would be most effective in controlling your symptoms.
Uroflowmetry
Uroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate.
You’ll be given a
local anaesthetic
and a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder.
Water will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. A computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working.
As with voiding charts, uroflowmetry is a good way of determining what type of treatment will help to control your symptoms.
Treating benign prostate enlargement
The treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are.
The 3 main treatments are:
lifestyle changes
medication
surgery
If your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you’ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland. This is often referred to as ‘watchful waiting’.
You may also be advised to make lifestyle changes to see whether they improve your symptoms.
Lifestyle changes
If your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to:
avoid drinking any liquids for 1 to 2 hours before going to bed – this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia)
experiment with the time you take prescribed medication – for example, taking it at 7pm may help prevent nocturia
stop drinking
alcohol
and caffeine, or limit your consumption of them – these drinks can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse
exercise regularly
– research shows moderate exercise, such as
walking
for 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it’s unclear exactly why this is the case
join a patient support group – your doctor should be able to recommend one, which may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medication
Bladder training
Bladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold.
You’ll be given a target, such as waiting at least 2 hours between each time you urinate.
It’s a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed – you’ll need a plastic jug to measure this. Your doctor should give you a chart to take home.
You’ll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate.
Over time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you’re able to go for longer without urinating.
Bladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision.
Medication
Medication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.
Finasteride or dutasteride
Finasteride and dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement.
They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve your associated symptoms.
Find out about the
causes of prostate enlargement
If you’re prescribed one of these medications, you may experience an immediate improvement in symptoms.
However, you’ll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year.
Use
condoms
if you’re sexually active – both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. If you get a woman pregnant, there’s a risk the baby could develop birth defects.
Other possible side effects can also include
impotence
and little or no sperm when you ejaculate.
In many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. See your GP if the side effects are troubling you.
Alpha blockers
Alpha blockers help relax the muscles of your bladder, making it easier to pass urine. You may be prescribed alpha blockers as your primary treatment or in combination with finasteride.
Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are 2 alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild.
They include:
dizziness
headaches
weakness
little or no sperm when you ejaculate
You should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you’re not planning to drive, as there’s a risk they could cause
low blood pressure (hypotension)
and fainting.
Generally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it’s passed.
Surgery
Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.
Various procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder.
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis.
A wire loop heated by an electric current is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate.
TURP is carried out using either a
general anaesthetic
, where you’re asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you’re awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed.
The procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. Most people are well enough to leave hospital 2 to 3 days after the operation.
After surgery, you’ll be unable to urinate normally at first because of your swollen urethra.
A thin tube called a catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. This will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.
A common complication of TURP is you’ll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.
It causes sperm to go into your bladder rather than out of your penis during ejaculation. However, you’ll still experience the physical pleasure associated with ejaculation (the climax).
Bladder neck incision (TUIP)
Bladder neck incision involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. It is also known as transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP).
Like TURP, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. The resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder.
This type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. As with TURP, TUIP is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic.
After surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. Like TURP, you’ll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you’re able to urinate normally.
There’s less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with TUIP compared with TURP, although it can sometimes still occur.
Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP)
Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is similar to a TURP. Excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. However, it uses a laser, rather than a wire loop.
There are some advantages to using this technique rather than a TURP, but also some disadvantages.
If you have been offered a HoLEP, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared with TURP.
Insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants
The insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants is a new surgical procedure that can help relieve urinary symptoms.
The procedure can be carried out under local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.
It involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra. The implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn’t blocked.
One of the big advantages of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with TURP and TUIP is a reduced risk to your sexual function – there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems.
There’s also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won’t need to stay in hospital as long.
However, prostatic urethral lift implants are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases. And as it’s a new procedure, the long-term outcomes are unknown and availability may be limited.
Read more about the use of
prostatic urethral lift implants
to relieve symptoms of prostate enlargement.
Transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP)
Transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP) is similar to a TURP, but parts of the prostate are destroyed (vaporised) rather than cut away.
Studies have shown that TUVP is as effective as TURP at improving symptoms. But some men and anyone with a prostate may need more treatment in the future.
Greenlight laser surgery (PVP)
A laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. This particular form of TUVP is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP), or Greenlight laser surgery.
A thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. A laser fibre is then passed through the cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow.
The procedure is recommended for those who don’t have a high risk of developing complications from treatment, such as men and anyone with a prostate who:
doesn’t have urinary retention
doesn’t have an increased risk of bleeding
has a prostate smaller than 100ml
In these ‘low-risk’ groups, Greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as TURP, but also has several benefits.
These include:
a shorter hospital stay – the procedure is often carried out as a day case
the catheter can be removed sooner
recovery is quicker
there’s a lower risk of complications
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website has more information about
GreenLight XPS for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia
.
Open prostatectomy
An open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than TURP if you have severe benign prostate enlargement.
However, it’s now rarely used, even for larger prostates, because other techniques have been developed, such as HoLEP.
During an open prostatectomy, an incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed.
The procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such as
erectile dysfunction
and
urinary incontinence
. There’s also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after TURP.
Complications of benign prostate enlargement
Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as a urinary tract infection or acute urinary retention.
Urinary tract infections
If you’re unable to empty your bladder properly, there’s a risk that bacteria in your urinary system won’t get flushed out and will spread through the urine to cause a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
.
Symptoms of a UTI include:
cloudy, bloody or bad
–
smelling urine
pain in your lower abdomen (tummy)
nausea
vomiting
shaking and chills
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
UTIs can be treated with
antibiotics
. A single UTI isn’t usually serious, but repeated UTIs can damage your kidneys and bladder. If you have a history of repeated UTIs, you may need to have surgery.
Acute urinary retention
Acute urinary retention (AUR) is the sudden inability to pass any urine. AUR should be treated as a medical emergency, because without prompt treatment urine may be passed back up into the kidneys, which can damage them.
Symptoms of AUR include:
the sudden inability to pass urine
severe lower abdominal pain
swelling of the bladder that you can feel with your hands
Phone 999 and ask for an ambulance if you or someone you know experiences the symptoms of AUR.
AUR can be treated using a thin tube (catheter) to drain the urine out of your bladder. In very serious cases, surgery may be required to empty the bladder."

Living with bipolar disorder
Introduction
Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another.
People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of:
depression – feeling very low and lethargic
mania – feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania)
Symptoms of bipolar disorder
depend on which mood you’re experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a “normal” mood very often.
Depression
You may initially be diagnosed with
clinical depression
before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be
diagnosed with bipolar disorder
.
During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of
suicide
.
If you’re feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible.
If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge, on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the
Samaritans
website.
Mania
During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can’t afford and wouldn’t normally want.
Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase.
You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of
psychosis
, where you see or hear things that aren’t there or become convinced of things that aren’t true.
Living with bipolar disorder
The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life.
However, there are several options for
treating bipolar disorder
that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible.
The following treatment options are available:
medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis

Bipolar disorder and pregnancy
Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it.
What causes bipolar disorder?
The exact
cause of bipolar disorder
is unknown, although it’s believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors.
Who’s affected?
Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life.
Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder.
The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes.
Symptoms
Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).
Episodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months.
Depression
During a period of depression, your symptoms may include:
feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time
lacking energy
difficulty concentrating and remembering things
loss of interest in everyday activities
feelings of emptiness or worthlessness
feelings of guilt and despair
feeling pessimistic about everything
self-doubt
being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking
lack of appetite
difficulty sleeping
waking up early
suicidal thoughts
Mania
The manic phase of bipolar disorder may include:
feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed
talking very quickly
feeling full of energy
feeling self-important
feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans
being easily distracted
being easily irritated or agitated
being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking
not feeling like sleeping
not eating
doing things that often have disastrous consequences – such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items
making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful
Patterns of depression and mania
If you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa.
Between episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a “normal” mood.
The patterns aren’t always the same and some people may experience:
rapid cycling – where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a “normal” period in between
mixed state – where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood
If your mood swings last a long time but aren’t severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder).
Living with bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes. A person with the condition may be unaware they’re in the manic phase.
After the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people are being negative or unhelpful.
Some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others. The extreme nature of the condition means staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There’s also an increased risk of
suicide
.
During episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren’t there (hallucinations).
They may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as
psychosis
or a psychotic episode.

Causes
The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition.
These are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors.
Chemical imbalance in the brain
Bipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain.
The chemicals responsible for controlling the brain’s functions are called neurotransmitters and include noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine.
There’s some evidence that if there’s an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some
symptoms of bipolar disorder
.
For example, there’s evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low.
Genetics
It’s also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. The family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves.
However, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers.
Triggers
A stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of stressful triggers include:
the breakdown of a relationship
physical, sexual or emotional abuse
the death of a close family member or loved one
These types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person’s life.
Bipolar disorder may also be triggered by:
physical illness
sleep disturbances
overwhelming problems in everyday life – such as problems with money, work or relationships
Diagnosis
If your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they’ll usually refer you to a psychiatrist (a medically qualified mental health specialist).
If your illness puts you at risk of harming yourself, your GP will arrange an appointment immediately.
Specialist assessment
You’ll be assessed by the psychiatrist at your appointment. They’ll ask you a few questions to determine if you have bipolar disorder. If you do, they’ll decide what treatments are most suitable.
During the assessment, you’ll be asked about your symptoms and when you first experienced them. The psychiatrist will also ask about how you feel leading up to and during an episode of mania or depression, and if you have thoughts about harming yourself.
The psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder.
If someone else in your family has the condition, the psychiatrist may want to talk to them. However, they’ll ask for your agreement before doing so.
Other tests
Depending on your symptoms, you may also need tests to see whether you have a physical problem, such as an
underactive thyroid
or an
overactive thyroid
.
If you have bipolar disorder, you’ll need to visit your GP regularly for a physical health check.
Treatment
Treatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the severity and number of episodes of depression and mania to allow as normal a life as possible.
Treatment options for bipolar disorder
If a person isn’t treated, episodes of bipolar-related mania can last for between three and six months. Episodes of
depression
tend to last longer, for between six and 12 months.
However, with effective treatment, episodes usually improve within about three months.
Most people with bipolar disorder can be treated using a combination of different treatments. These can include one or more of the following:
medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis
medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur
learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania
psychological treatment – such as talking therapies, which help you deal with depression and provide advice on how to improve relationships
lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on
improving your diet
and
getting more sleep

Most people with bipolar disorder can receive most of their treatment without having to stay in hospital.
However, hospital treatment may be needed if your symptoms are severe, or if you’re being treated under the Mental Health Act, as there’s a danger you may self-harm or hurt others.
In some circumstances, you could have treatment in a day hospital and return home at night.
Medication
Several medications are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly referred to as mood stabilisers and include:
lithium carbonate
anticonvulsant medicines
antipsychotic medicines
If you’re already taking medication for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, your GP will check you’re taking the correct dose. If you aren’t, they’ll change it.
Episodes of depression are treated slightly differently in bipolar disorder, as the use of antidepressants alone may lead to a hypomanic relapse.
Most guidelines suggest depression in bipolar disorder can be treated with just a mood stabiliser. However, antidepressants are commonly used alongside a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic.

antidepressants
If your GP or psychiatrist recommends you stop taking medication for bipolar disorder, the dose should be gradually reduced over at least four weeks, and up to three months if you are taking an antipsychotic or lithium.
If you have to stop taking lithium for any reason, see your GP about taking an antipsychotic or valproate instead.
Lithium carbonate
In the UK, lithium carbonate (often referred to as just lithium) is the medication most commonly used to treat bipolar disorder.
Lithium is a long-term method of treatment for episodes of mania, hypomania and depression. It’s usually prescribed for at least six months.
If you’re prescribed lithium, stick to the prescribed dose and don’t stop taking it suddenly (unless told to by your doctor).
For lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. If it’s incorrect, you may get side effects such as diarrhoea and vomiting. However, tell your doctor immediately if you have side effects while taking lithium.
You’ll need regular blood tests at least every three months while taking lithium. This is to make sure your lithium levels aren’t too high or too low.
Your kidney and thyroid function will also need to be checked every two to three months if the dose of lithium is being adjusted, and every 12 months in all other cases.
While you’re taking lithium, avoid using
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as
ibuprofen
, unless they’re prescribed by your GP.
In the UK, lithium and the antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole are currently the only medications licensed for use in adolescents with bipolar disorder who are aged 13 or over.
However, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health states that unlicensed medicines may be prescribed for children if there are no suitable alternatives and their use can be justified by expert agreement.
Anticonvulsant medicines
Anticonvulsant medicines include:
valproate
carbamazepine
lamotrigine
These medicines are sometimes used to treat episodes of mania. They’re also long-term mood stabilisers.
Anticonvulsant medicines are often used to treat
epilepsy
, but they’re also effective in treating bipolar disorder.
A single anticonvulsant medicine may be used, or they may be used in combination with lithium when the condition doesn’t respond to lithium on its own.
Valproate
Valproate isn’t usually prescribed for women of childbearing age because there’s a risk of physical defects to babies such as spina bifida, heart abnormalities and cleft lip. There may also be an increased risk of developmental problems such as lower intellectual abilities, poor speaking and understanding, memory problems, autistic spectrum disorders and delayed walking and talking.
Learn more about the
risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy
In women, your GP may decide to use valporate if there’s no alternative or if you’ve been assessed and it’s unlikely you’ll respond to other treatments, although they’ll need to check you’re using a reliable contraception and advise you on the risks of taking the medicine during pregnancy.
If you’re prescribed valproate, you’ll need to visit your GP to have a blood count when you begin the medication, and then again six months later.
Carbamazepine
Carbamazepine is usually only prescribed on the advice of an expert in bipolar disorder. To begin with, the dose will be low and then gradually increased.
Your progress will be carefully monitored if you’re taking other medication, including the contraceptive pill.
Blood tests to check your liver and kidney function will be carried out when you start taking carbamazepine, and again after six months.
You’ll also need to have a blood count at the start and after six months, and you may also have your weight and height monitored.
Lamotrigine
If you’re prescribed lamotrigine, you’ll usually be started on a low dose, which will be increased gradually.
See your GP immediately if you’re taking lamotrigine and develop a rash. You’ll need to have an annual health check, but other tests aren’t usually needed.
Women who are taking the contraceptive pill should talk to their GP about taking a different method of contraception.
Antipsychotic medicines
Antipsychotic medicines are sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania or hypomania. Antipsychotic medicines include:
aripiprazole
olanzapine
quetiapine
risperidone
They may also be used as a long-term mood stabiliser. Quetiapine may also be used for long-term bipolar depression.
Antipsychotic medicines can be particularly useful if symptoms are severe or behaviour is disturbed. As antipsychotics can cause side effects – such as blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation and weight gain – the initial dose will usually be low.
If you’re prescribed an antipsychotic medicine, you’ll need to have regular health checks at least every three months, but possibly more often, particularly if you have diabetes. If your symptoms don’t improve, you may be offered lithium and valproate as well.
Aripiprazole is also recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an option for treating moderate to severe manic episodes in adolescents with bipolar disorder.
Rapid cycling
You may be prescribed a combination of lithium and valproate if you experience rapid cycling (where you quickly change from highs to lows without a “normal” period in between).
If this doesn’t help, you may be offered lithium on its own or a combination of lithium, valproate and lamotrigine.
However, you won’t usually be prescribed an antidepressant unless an expert in bipolar disorder has recommended it.
Learning to recognise triggers
If you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression.
A community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history.
This won’t prevent the episode occurring, but it will allow you to get help in time.
This may mean making some changes to your treatment, perhaps by adding an antidepressant or antipsychotic medicine to the mood-stabilising medication you’re already taking. Your GP or specialist can advise you on this.
Psychological treatment
Some people find psychological treatment helpful when used alongside medication in between episodes of mania or depression. This may include:
psychoeducation – to find out more about bipolar disorder
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
– this is most useful when treating depression
family therapy – a type of
psychotherapy
that focuses on family relationships (such as marriage) and encourages everyone within the family or relationship to work together to improve mental health
Psychological treatment usually consists of around 16 sessions. Each session lasts an hour and takes place over a period of six to nine months.
Pregnancy
The management of bipolar disorder in women who are
pregnant
, or those who are trying to conceive, is complex and challenging.
One of the main problems is the risks of taking medication during pregnancy aren’t always that well understood.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the risks of treating or not treating women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy should be fully discussed.
NICE also recommends that specialist mental health services work closely with maternity services.
A written plan for managing the treatment of a pregnant woman with bipolar disorder should be developed as soon as possible.
The plan should be drawn up with the patient, her partner, her obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor.
The following medication isn’t routinely prescribed for pregnant women with bipolar disorder:
valproate – there’s a risk to the foetus and the subsequent development of the child
carbamazepine – it has limited effectiveness and there’s risk of harm to the foetus
lithium – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiac problems
lamotrigine – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus
paroxetine – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiovascular malformations
benzodiazepines – if used long term, there are risks during the pregnancy and immediately after the birth, such as cleft palate and floppy baby syndrome
If you become pregnant while taking medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, it’s important that you don’t stop taking it until you’ve discussed it with your doctor.
If medication is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby is born, it may also affect a mother’s decision to breastfeed her child. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances.
Living with bipolar disorder
Although it’s usually a long-term condition, effective
treatments for bipolar disorder
, combined with self-help techniques, can limit the condition’s impact on your everyday life.
Staying active and eating well
Eating well and keeping fit are important for everyone. Exercise can also help reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder, particularly depressive symptoms.
It may also give you something to focus on and provide a routine, which is important for many people.
A healthy diet, combined with exercise, may also help limit weight gain, which is a common side effect of medical treatments for bipolar disorder.
Some treatments also increase the risk of developing diabetes, or worsen the illness in people that already have it. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising are an important way of limiting that risk.
You should have a check-up at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or
diabetes
.
This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure and having any appropriate blood tests.

Self-care and self-management
Self-care
Self-care is an essential part of daily life. It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from the people involved in your care.
It includes:
staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health
preventing illness or accidents
caring more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions
People with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being helped with self-care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent.
Self-management programmes
Self-management programmes aim to help people with bipolar disorder take an active part in their own recovery so they’re not controlled by their condition.
One course run by
Bipolar UK
aims to teach people with bipolar disorder how to manage their illness. The programme includes information about:
triggers and warning signs
coping strategies and self-medication
support networks and action plans
maintaining a healthy lifestyle
drawing up an advance decision
complementary therapies
action plans
There are other courses, such as those run by
Self Management UK
, for mild to moderate mental health conditions.
Courses such as these help people who may feel distressed and uncertain about their bipolar disorder improve their own lives.
Talking about it
Some people with bipolar disorder find it easy to talk to family and friends about their condition and its effects. Other people find it easier to turn to charities and support groups.
Many organisations run self-help groups that can put you in touch with other people with the condition. This enables people to share helpful ideas and helps them realise they’re not alone in feeling the way they do. These organisations also provide online support in forums and blogs.
Some useful charities, support groups and associations include:
Bipolar UK
Carers UK
Mind
Rethink
Samaritans
SANE
Talking therapies
are useful for managing bipolar disorder, particularly during periods of stability.
Services that can help
You may be involved with many different services during treatment for bipolar disorder. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority.
These services may include:
Community mental health teams (CMHT) – these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services. They offer assessment, treatment and social care to people with bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses.
Early intervention teams – these provide early identification and treatment for people who have the first symptoms of psychosis. Your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team.
Crisis services – these allow people to be treated at home, instead of in hospital, for an acute episode. These are specialist mental health teams that deal with crises that occur outside normal office hours.
Acute day hospital – these are an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital. You can visit every day or as often as you need.
Assertive outreach teams – these deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems, providing rapid help in a crisis. Staff often visit people at home and liaise with other services, such as your GP or social services. They can also help with practical problems, such as helping to find housing and work, or doing your shopping and cooking.
Avoiding drugs and alcohol
Some people with bipolar disorder use alcohol or illegal drugs to try to take away their pain and distress. Both have well-known harmful physical and social effects and are not a substitute for effective treatment and good healthcare.
Some people with bipolar disorder find they can stop misusing alcohol and drugs once they’re using effective treatment.
Others may have separate but related problems of alcohol and drug abuse, which may need to be treated separately.
Avoiding alcohol and illegal drugs is an important part of recovery from episodes of manic, hypomanic or depressive symptoms, and can help you gain stability.

alcohol misuse
Money and benefits
It’s important to avoid too much
stress
, including work-related stress. If you’re employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressure triggers your symptoms.
Under the
Equality Act 2010
, people are protected from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. This can include people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses.
A range of benefits is available to people with bipolar disorder who can’t work as a result of their mental illness. The
Adult Disability Payment
is managed by
Social Security Scotland.
Depending on your circumstances, you may qualify from non-devolved
benefits from the UK Government
.

Living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder
People living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder can have a tough time. During episodes of illness, the personalities of people with bipolar disorder may change, and they may become abusive or even violent.
Sometimes social workers and the police may become involved. Relationships and family life are likely to feel the strain.
If you’re the Named Person
(as defined by the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015)
of a person with bipolar disorder, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the person’s interests.
These include requesting that the local social services authority asks an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with bipolar disorder should be detained in hospital (also known as “sectioning”).
You may feel at a loss if you’re caring for someone with bipolar disorder. Finding a support group and talking to other people in a similar situation might help.
If you’re having relationship or marriage difficulties, you can contact specialist relationship counsellors, who can talk things through with you and your partner.

Dealing with suicidal feelings
Having suicidal thoughts is a common depressive symptom of bipolar disorder. Without treatment, these thoughts may get stronger.
Some research has shown the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is 15 to 20 times greater than the general population.
Studies have also shown that as many as 25-50% of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once.
The risk of
suicide
seems to be higher earlier in the illness, so early recognition and help may prevent it.
If you’re feeling suicidal or you’re having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or the local mental health emergency services as soon as possible.
If you can’t or don’t want to contact these people, contact the Samaritans on 116 123. You can call them 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Alternatively, visit the
Samaritans website
or email

Self-harm
Self-harm (sometimes called self-injury) is often a symptom of mental health problems such as bipolar disorder.
For some people, self-harm is a way of gaining control over their lives or temporarily distracting themselves from mental distress. It may not be related to suicide or attempted suicide.

About sepsis
Phone 999 immediately or go to A&E if:
You or someone else has symptoms like:
loss of consciousness
severe breathlessness
a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature
a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation
slurred speech
cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin
a fast heartbeat
fast breathing
chills and shivering

feeling dizzy or faint
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
What is sepsis?
Sepsis is a serious complication of an infection.
Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.
What causes a sepsis infection?
The immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. This is called a localised infection. To do this, the body produces white blood cells.
White blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. This triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. This helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading.
However, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe.
Widespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues.
Sources of infection
Sepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the:
lungs
urinary tract
tummy (abdomen)
pelvis
However, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can’t be identified.
Infections linked to sepsis
appendicitis – infection in the appendix
cellulitis – a skin infection that can be caused by an intravenous
catheter
that’s been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication
cholangitis – an infection of the bile duct
cholecystitis – an infection of the gallbladder
encephalitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system
endocarditis – a heart infection
flu – only in some cases
meningitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system
peritonitis – an infection of the thin layer of tissue that lines the abdomen
pneumonia – a lung infection
post-surgery infections
osteomyelitis – a bone infection
urinary tract infection – an infection of the bladder, urethra or kidneys
Tests to diagnose sepsis
Sepsis is often diagnosed by testing your:
temperature
heart rate
breathing rate
blood
Other tests can help determine the type of infection, where it’s located and which parts of the body have been affected. These include:
urine or stool samples
a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing
respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus
blood pressure tests
imaging studies – like an
X-ray
,
ultrasound scan
or
computerised tomography (CT) scan
Who’s at risk of sepsis?
Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who:
are very young
are very old
are pregnant
have had a urinary catheter fitted
have a long term health condition like diabetes
have recently had surgery
are genetically prone to infections
are already in hospital with a serious illness
have to stay in hospital for a long time
have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident
have a medical condition that weakens the immune system – like
HIV
or leukaemia
are receiving medical treatment that weakens the immune system – like
chemotherapy
or long-term steroids
are on mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe
Recovering from sepsis
Some people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on:
the severity of the sepsis
the person’s overall health
how much time was spent in hospital
whether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (ICU)
Long term effects of sepsis
Some people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome.
Symptoms of post-sepsis syndrome include:
feeling lethargic or excessively tired
muscle weakness
swollen limbs
joint pain
chest pain
breathlessness
Symptoms of sepsis
Sepsis can cause a variety of symptoms.
Sepsis symptoms in children under 5
Temperature
over 38C (babies under 3 months)
over 39C (babies aged 3 to 6 months)
below 36C – check 3 times in a 10-minute period
a high temperature in a child who can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything
Breathing
difficulty breathing – this looks like hard work
grunting with every breath
struggling to speak more than a few words at once (for older children who normally talk)
breathing that obviously “pauses”
Eating and drinking
no interest in feeding (child under 1 month)
not drinking for more than 8 hours (when awake)
black, green or bloody vomit
Body
a soft spot on a baby’s head that bulges
“sunken” eyes
a baby that’s floppy
a child that can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything
weak, whining or continuous crying in a younger child
confusion in an older child
irritableness
unresponsive
stiffness in the neck, especially when trying to look up or down
not had a wee or wet nappy for 12 hours
Go to A&E or call 999 if your child:
is very lethargic or difficult to wake
feels abnormally cold to touch
is breathing very fast
has a rash that does not fade when you press it
has a fit or convulsion
Trust your instincts and phone 111 if your child’s symptoms are getting worse or they are sicker than you’d expect (even if their temperature falls).
Sepsis symptoms in older children and adults
Early symptoms of sepsis may include:
a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature
chills and shivering
a fast heartbeat
fast breathing
Symptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock
In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or
septic shock
(when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.
These can include:
feeling dizzy or faint
a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation
diarrhoea
nausea and vomiting
slurred speech
severe muscle pain
severe breathlessness
less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day
cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin
loss of consciousness
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
you’ve recently had an infection or injury and you have possible signs of sepsis
you think you or someone in your care has severe sepsis or septic shock
Don’t be afraid to ask the healthcare professional ‘is this sepsis?’.
Treating sepsis
Treatment for sepsis varies, depending on the:
area affected
cause of the infection
organs affected
extent of any damage
If you have the early signs of sepsis, you’ll usually be referred to hospital. You’ll then be given a diagnosis and treatment.
Emergency treatment
You’ll need emergency treatment, or treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), if:
the sepsis is severe
you develop
septic shock
– when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level
ICUs can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. This allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection.
Sepsis is treatable if it’s identified and treated quickly. In most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.
Antibiotics
The main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is
antibiotics
. These will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).
Ideally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis.
Intravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. You may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.
Types of antibiotics
If sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. This is because there won’t be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. They usually cure most common infections.
Once a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used.
Viral infections
If the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t work. However, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. This means antibiotics are usually given anyway.
With a viral infection, you’ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. However, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.
Intravenous fluids
If you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure.
If you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours.
It’s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. This helps them spot signs of kidney failure.
If you’re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given
a catheter
. This is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.
Oxygen
Your body’s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis.
If you’re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you’ll usually be given oxygen. This is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.
Treating the source of infection
If a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated.
For example, any pus may need to be drained away. In more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.
Increasing blood pressure
Medications called vasopressors are used if you have
low blood pressure
caused by sepsis.
Vasopressors are normally given intravenously while you’re in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.
Other treatments
You may require additional treatments like:
corticosteroids
insulin medication
a blood transfusion
mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe
dialysis
– where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys
These treatments are mostly used in ICUs."

A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).
Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.
benign brain tumours
are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment
malignant brain tumours
are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they’re more likely to grow back after treatment
This page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour.
Symptoms of a brain tumour
The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that’s affected. Common symptoms include:
severe, persistent
headaches
seizures (fits)
persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness
mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality
progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems
Sometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time.
When to speak to your GP
Speak to your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it’s unlikely to be a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.
Who is affected
Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.
More than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary brain tumours in the UK each year, of which about half are benign and half are malignant. Many others are diagnosed with secondary brain tumours.
The exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown, but it’s thought that certain genetic conditions – such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and
tuberous sclerosis
– and previous
radiotherapy
to the head increase your risk.
Treatment and outlook
The main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible.
It’s not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy
may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind.
For most benign tumours, treatment is often successful and a full recovery is possible, although there’s sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back. Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this.
The outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately, a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment.
If a tumour does come back, treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.

Introduction
This section about bone cancer is for teenagers and young adults. There are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. If you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you could
talk to Macmillan
.
If you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general
bone cancer
section.
Types of bone cancer
There are different types of bone cancer. The 2 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.
Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone.
Ewing sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it’s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the 2 hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage.
In this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer.
Causes
The cause of bone cancer is unknown. Because it’s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes.
People often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there’s no evidence for this.
Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.
Signs and symptoms of bone cancer
Bone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.
The main symptoms are:
pain or tenderness – this may start as an ache that doesn’t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night
swelling around the affected area of bone – swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn’t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body
reduced movement – if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it’s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it’s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms
a broken bone – a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer.
There might also be other symptoms including:
tiredness
a high temperature
loss of appetite
weight loss
If you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrange
tests
if they feel they’re needed.
Remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have bone cancer.
The bones
Knowing what your bones do might help you understand what bone cancer is.
Bones are like human scaffolding. They help keep you upright. The human skeleton is made up of more than 200 bones of different shapes and sizes.
Bones do lots of important things:
they work with joints and connective tissue so that you can move around
they protect parts of the body from injury – for example, the ribs protect the heart and lungs
they store calcium
some bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cells
Joints
Joints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. There are different types of joint. Some work as levers, like the finger joint. Others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. There are different types of connective tissue that help bones move:
ligaments are tough cords of tissue that attach bones to each other
cartilage is a slippery material that covers the ends of bones to stop them rubbing together
muscles are made of tough, stretchy tissue and give strength
tendons are strong cords of tissue that attach muscles to bones

Tests for bone cancer
There are some tests you might have when you visit your GP or at the hospital. The tests will help the doctors see whether you have bone cancer.
Visiting your GP
If you think you might have some of the
symptoms of bone cancer
, you should speak to your GP.
Your GP will talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and usually arrange some tests, such as X-rays and blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you’re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can’t find the cause, you may be referred to a specialist at the hospital.
At the hospital
The hospital you’re referred to will depend on the results of the tests. You may go straight to a doctor specialising in bone cancer, or you might see doctors with more general experience first.
The hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests:
X-rays
bone scans
biopsies
MRI
and/or
CT scans
If you’re diagnosed with bone cancer and not already seeing a specialist bone doctor, you’ll be referred to one.
Further tests
If the tests show you have bone cancer, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general:
blood tests
tests to check your heart is healthy
chest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy
tests to check your kidneys are healthy – you may need to give a sample of pee (urine) to be tested
This may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.
Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.

Treating bone cancer
The information on this page is about Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. If you have a different type of bone cancer and want to know more, you can
talk to Macmillan
.
The 3 main treatments for bone cancer are
chemotherapy
, surgery and
radiotherapy
. Most people have a combination of these.
Your doctors will plan your treatment based on:
the type of bone cancer you have
where the cancer is
the stage of the cancer (this means whether it has spread outside the bone)
how fast-growing the cancer is
If you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They’ll be happy to help you understand what’s involved.
You may be offered the opportunity to take part in a clinical research trial. These trials help doctors find new and better treatments for people with bone cancer. If your doctor thinks you are suitable for a clinical trial, they’ll discuss this with you.
In this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. It’s an important treatment for bone tumours. It helps shrink the tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, and it can kill cells that have spread outside the bone. After your surgery or radiotherapy, you’ll usually have more chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy for bone cancer is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line.
You’ll have chemotherapy over a few days and then you’ll have some time off to give your body a chance to recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. You’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy.
The type of chemotherapy you have depends on whether the tumour is an Ewing sarcoma or an osteosarcoma.
Chemotherapy for Ewing sarcoma
For Ewing sarcoma, the drugs most often used first are vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. Giving these drugs together is called VIDE. You’ll usually have 6 cycles of VIDE.
After your chemotherapy you may have surgery, or, if the tumour can’t be removed with an operation, you’ll have radiotherapy. Some people have both surgery and radiotherapy. The team looking after you will decide on the best combination for you.
If you have surgery, you’ll have more chemotherapy afterwards to help stop the tumour coming back or spreading to other parts of the body.
At the moment, there is a clinical trial called Euro-Ewing 2012 that is comparing different combinations of chemotherapy treatments before and after surgery for people with Ewing sarcomas. You can talk to your specialist doctor about whether you could take part in this trial.
Chemotherapy for osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is usually treated with 3 chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cisplatin. Giving these drugs together is called MAP.
You will usually have 6 cycles of chemotherapy in total. Each cycle takes about 5 weeks. After the first 2 cycles, you’ll have surgery to remove the cancer.
If the cancer has spread, you may also need to have surgery on another part of your body. For example, if osteosarcoma spreads outside of the main tumour, it usually spreads to the lungs. If the cancer has spread to your lungs, you may need a second operation to remove the cancer in your lungs. If you have bone cancer that’s spread, your doctors will talk to you about what will happen next.
After surgery, you’ll have 4 more cycles of MAP chemotherapy. You may also be given a new treatment called mifamurtide (Mepact), which helps your body kill tumour cells. Your doctor will tell you if you can have this drug as well as your chemotherapy.
Side effects
Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It’s hard to know how it’s going to be for you. Most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops.
The most common are a sore mouth,
hair loss
, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.
The most common side effect of mifamurtide is having a high temperature or feeling cold and shivery for a few hours after it’s given.
Surgery
The surgery you have will depend on the type of bone cancer you have and where it is in the body.
Your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, while trying to keep as much function in the limb as possible.
Limb-sparing surgery
Most people with bone cancer have an operation called limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon removes the cancer without having to remove the arm or leg it’s in. You’ll have all the tumour taken away from your limb, including any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.
It’s usually possible to remove the affected part of the bone and replace it with a custom-made metal fitting (endoprosthesis) or with a bone from another part of the body (bone graft). If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, the whole joint can often be replaced with an artificial one. In some cases, the surgeon can remove the affected bone without replacing it with anything and without it affecting the way you move.
Before the operation
If you’ve had chemotherapy, you’ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover before you can have your operation. Doctors will make sure that you’re well enough to have the operation. If you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit before the operation. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You’ll probably see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to strengthen your muscles.
You may like to see the replacement part or endoprosthesis (often just called a prosthesis) that will be put in during your operation. If you would like to see it, your surgeon or key worker can usually arrange this.
After the operation
You’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it supported and let it heal.
You’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days.
You won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein. This is called a drip.
You’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 or 3 days. As time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable.
Once you’re home, you should start to feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems, it’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away, so they can deal with them quickly.
After your operation, you will need to do lots of physiotherapy to help you make the best possible recovery. This can feel like hard work but is really important. Your physiotherapist will tell you what exercises to do, and help you to do them regularly.
If you notice any new redness, pain or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s very important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.
There’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on
living with and after bone cancer
.
Amputation
Sometimes the only way to get rid of the bone cancer affecting an arm or a leg is to remove the limb. This is called an amputation. It’s only done if there is no alternative. This is usually needed if the cancer has spread from the bone and has grown around nearby blood vessels. These need to be removed along with the cancer.
Some people choose to have an amputation rather than limb-sparing surgery. You should be given a chance to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your team.
An amputation may also need to be done if there’s an infection in the bone that doesn’t go away with treatment, or if the cancer comes back in the bone. Every person and every tumour is different, so you might meet other people with the same type of tumour, who are having slightly different surgery. Your specialist will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand what’s involved.
Before the operation
Your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and it might help to talk to your specialist nurse, key worker or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who’s had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It’s really important to get support at this tough time.
After the operation
You’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a tube, called a drain, coming from the wound. This stops fluid building up. A nurse will usually take it out after 3 or 4 days. You’ll also have a drip to give you fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.
You’ll probably feel a bit sore after your op, especially for the first 2 or 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. As time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. You may have pain that feels like it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as ‘phantom pain’. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.
A physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.
If you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.
Once you’re up and about, you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.
It’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and learn how to use it in physiotherapy.
You should be able to go home about 2 weeks after your operation.
There’s more information about the long-term effects of amputation in our section on
living with and after bone cancer
.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells.
Radiotherapy is mainly used to treat Ewing sarcoma. You may have radiotherapy after your chemotherapy, or before or after having surgery.
If you have osteosarcoma, you’re less likely to have radiotherapy treatment. But you might have it if an operation to remove the cancer isn’t possible. Occasionally, people with osteosarcoma have radiotherapy after surgery to remove their cancer.
Radiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday) for 5 weeks. Each treatment takes a few minutes.
Side effects
Radiotherapy isn’t painful, but it can cause other side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.
Other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.

Life after treatment for bone cancer
This information is about life after having
surgery for bone cancer
.
Life after limb-sparing surgery
The long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about this is your surgeon.
After limb-sparing surgery, the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.
Knee joint replacement
If you’ve had a knee joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint.
It’s usually OK to run a short distance, for example for a bus. But running or jogging regularly wears out the new joint, so it’s best to avoid this. If your knee joint wears out or loosens, you might need to have it replaced after a few years.
Hip joint replacements
After a hip joint replacement, you should be able to do most of your usual activities, but you’ll probably be advised to avoid running and high-impact sports.
Shoulder replacement
If you’ve had a shoulder replacement, you’ll be able to move your arm below shoulder height the same as before, but you might not be able to lift your arm above your shoulder.
Bone graft
If you’ve had an implant put into your limb while you’re still growing, you’ll need to have it lengthened as your leg or arm grows. Some types of implant can be lengthened without an operation, but with others you’ll need surgery. Your specialist or key worker can tell you what kind of implant you have.
Life after amputation
After amputation, you usually have an artificial limb fitted. This is called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.
Different types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.
How will I feel?
Things may be tough as you get used to living with the changes in your body, but help is available. You might have lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or sad at times. You might feel like you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it’s important to get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:
your specialist nurse or key worker
family or friends
a counsellor, which can be arranged by your nurses
other young people in a similar situation
Other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.
Try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends who you can talk to if things get you down. You might find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like your specialist nurse, key worker or counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind.
Follow-up
When you finish your treatment, your doctor will talk to you about what happens next. They will explain some of the long-term risks that bone cancer and its treatment could have for you. They will make arrangements to see you in a clinic to see how you are getting on.

About bone cancer
Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.
This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body.
These pages only refer to primary bone cancer. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about
secondary bone cancer
.
Signs and symptoms of bone cancer
Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.
The main symptoms include:
persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night
swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint
a noticeable lump over a bone
a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal
If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP. While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.
Read more about the
symptoms of bone cancer
Types of bone cancer
Some of the main types of bone cancer are:
osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20
Ewing sarcoma
– which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20
chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40
Young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop.
These types of bone cancer affect different types of cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.
What causes bone cancer?
In most cases, it’s not known why a person develops bone cancer.
You’re more at risk of developing it if you:
have had previous exposure to radiation during
radiotherapy
have a condition known as Paget’s disease of the bone – however, only a very small number of people with Paget’s disease will actually develop bone cancer
have a rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome – people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells
Read more about the
causes of bone cancer
How bone cancer is treated
Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.
Most people have a combination of:
surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, but
amputation
is sometimes necessary
chemotherapy
– treatment with powerful cancer-killing medication
radiotherapy
– where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells
In some cases of osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may also be recommended.
Read more about
treating bone cancer
Outlook
The outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).
Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn’t spread.
Symptoms of bone cancer
Bone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well.
Bone pain
Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.
Any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.
The pain can sometimes be wrongly mistaken for
arthritis
in adults and growing pains in children and teenagers.
Other symptoms
Some people also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.
In some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily after a minor injury or
fall
.
Less common symptoms can include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
unexplained weight loss
sweating, particularly at night
When to seek medical advice
Speak to your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you’re worried about any symptoms.
While it’s highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
Read more about
diagnosing bone cancer
Causes of bone cancer
Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
The exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including:
previous
radiotherapy
treatment
other bone conditions, such as Paget’s disease of the bone
rare genetic conditions, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome
a history of certain other conditions, including retinoblastoma and
umbilical hernia
Radiotherapy treatment
Previous exposure to high doses of radiation during
radiotherapy
may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small.
Bone conditions
Some non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small.
In particular, a condition called Paget’s disease of the bone can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50 to 60 years of age.
Rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier’s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.
Genetic conditions
A rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer.
People with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.
Other conditions
People who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions.
Research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma, although the risk is still very small.
Diagnosing bone cancer
If you’re experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests.
They will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience – whether it’s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse.
After being examined, you may be referred for an
X-ray
of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist for a further assessment.
X-rays
An X-ray is a procedure where radiation is used to produce images of the inside of the body. It’s a particularly effective way of looking at bones.
X-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that’s growing because of cancer. They can also determine whether your symptoms are caused by something else, such as a broken bone (fracture).
If an X-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. As bone cancer is rare, there are a small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.
Biopsy
The most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a
biopsy
.
A biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below).
A biopsy can be carried out in two ways:
A core needle biopsy is performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a
local anaesthetic
or
general anaesthetic
). A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue.
An open biopsy is performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue.
You may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.
Further tests
If the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it’s likely you’ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below.
MRI scan
A
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues.
An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones.
CT scan
A
computerised tomography (CT) scan
involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3D) image of your body.
CT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose.
Bone scans
A bone scan can give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins.
Abnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as “hot spots” on the scan.
Bone marrow biopsy
If you have a type of bone cancer called
Ewing sarcoma
, you may have a test called a bone marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones).
During the test, a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic.
Staging and grading
Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future.
A widely used staging system for bone cancer in the UK uses 3 main stages:
stage 1 – the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone
stage 2 – the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade
stage 3  – the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs
Most cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good chance of being cured. Unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.
Coping with a diagnosis
Being told you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or if you’re a parent of a child who has just been told they have bone cancer.
These types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger
depression
. If you think you may be depressed, your GP may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly treatment.
You may also find it useful to contact the
Bone Cancer Research Trust
, which is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you’re a teenager you may want to contact the
Teenage Cancer Trust
, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.

coping with a cancer diagnosis
Treating bone cancer
Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. The main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Your treatment plan
Your treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you’ll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (MDT).
Members of the MDT will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others.
Your MDT will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours.
Your recommended treatment plan may include a combination of:
surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, although
amputation
is occasionally necessary
chemotherapy
– treatment with powerful cancer-killing medication
radiotherapy
– where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells
In some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.
Surgery
Surgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it’s often combined with the other treatments mentioned below.
Nowadays, it’s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).
Limb-sparing surgery
Limb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed.
The most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue).
The removed section of bone may then be replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft).
If the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about
knee joint replacement
and hip joint replacement.
Amputation
Amputation may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if:
the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves
you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed
the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle
Your care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation.
After an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that’s removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life.
Recovering from surgery
After limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you’ll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and
occupational therapy
, where you’re taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities.
After an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment. Read more about
living with an amputation
.
Chemotherapy
There are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used:
before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier
in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation) – this approach works particularly well in the treatment of
Ewing sarcoma
after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning
to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy)
Chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel.
The treatment is usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. The number of cycles you need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.
Side effects
Chemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects.
Common side effects of chemotherapy include:
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
mouth ulcers
tiredness
increased risk of catching infections
temporary
hair loss
infertility
Most side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. However, there is a risk you will be permanently infertile. Your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
Radiotherapy
As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible.
Radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine.
This is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.
Side effects
The radiation you’re exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to side effects such as:
reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn)
joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated
feeling sick
hair loss in the body part being treated
tiredness
These side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks.
Read more about the
side effects of radiotherapy
Mifamurtide
For people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside other treatments.
Mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells that kill cancerous cells.
It’s normally recommended for young people with high-grade osteosarcomas and is given after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning.
Mifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). The recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.
Side effects
Mifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include:
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea or
constipation
headache
dizziness
loss of appetite
tiredness and weakness
It’s unclear whether it’s safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it’s important to use an effective method of
contraception
if you’re a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you think you’re pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide.
Follow-up
Once your treatment has finished, you’ll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check the cancer hasn’t returned.
You’ll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished – possibly every 3 months. These will become less frequent as the years go on.
Contact your specialist or GP if you develop
symptoms of bone cancer
again and think the cancer may have come back."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/brain-stem-death/,"Brain stem death
Brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe.
When this happens, a ventilator keeps the person’s heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream.
A person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost.
Confirming death
Confirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function.
Confirming death is now more complex, because it’s possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won’t ever regain consciousness or start breathing again.
Once the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there’s no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used.
To save a person’s family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there’s clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the ventilator.
The brain stem
The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that’s connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).
The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body’s automatic functions that are essential for life. These include:
breathing
heartbeat
blood pressure
swallowing
The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain’s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement.
After brain death, it’s not possible for someone to remain conscious.
How brain death occurs
Brain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by:
cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen
heart attack
– a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked
stroke
– a serious medical emergency that happens when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted
blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body
Brain death can also occur as a result of:
a
severe head injury
a brain haemorrhage
infections, such as encephalitis
a
brain tumour
Vegetative state
There’s a difference between brain death and a vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage.
Someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness – for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings.
In rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings.
However, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that:
some form of consciousness may exist
breathing unaided is usually possible
there’s a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem’s core functions may be unaffected
A person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support.
Confirming brain death
Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead.
These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C).
Therefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, like shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light.
Organ and tissue donation
After brain death has occurred, it may be possible for the person’s organs and tissue to be used in transplantations. This can often save or improve the lives of others.
Only 1% of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible. This means every opportunity for donation is very precious.
Specialist nurses will discuss the possibility of donation with families. This’ll be done in a sensitive way. They’ll also check the NHS Organ Donor Register to see if the person had recorded a donation decision and share this information with the family. This lets the family know what their loved one wanted. It also means that nurses can check if this was their latest view.
Further information about organ and tissue donation
Diagnosing brain stem death
There are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain stem death.
For a diagnosis of brain stem death to be made:
a person must be unconscious and fail to respond to outside stimulation
a person’s heartbeat and breathing can only be maintained using a ventilator
there must be clear evidence that serious brain damage has occurred and it can’t be cured
Ruling out other conditions
Before testing for brain stem death, doctors must carry out a series of checks to ensure that the symptoms aren’t being caused by other factors, like:
an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents
an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia)
severe under-activity of the thyroid gland
Once these factors have been ruled out, tests are carried out to confirm brain death. The diagnosis of brain death has to be made by two senior doctors. Neither of them can be involved with the hospital’s transplant team.
The doctors will explain the tests to you and they’ll keep you informed about your loved one’s condition at all times.
Tests
The doctors will run a series of tests. Both doctors have to agree on the results for a diagnosis of brain death to be confirmed. The tests are carried out twice to minimise any chance of error.
The tests used to determine whether brain stem death has occurred are outlined below:
A torch is shone into both eyes to see if they react to the light.
The cornea (transparent outer layer of the eye), which is usually very sensitive, is stroked with a tissue or piece of cotton wool to see if the eye reacts.
Pressure is applied to the forehead and the nose is pinched to see if there’s any movement in response.
Ice-cold water is inserted into each ear, which would usually cause the eyes to move.
A thin, plastic tube is placed down the trachea (windpipe) to see if it provokes gagging or coughing.
The person is disconnected from the ventilator for a short period of time to see if they make any attempt to breathe on their own.
Brain death will be diagnosed if a person fails to respond to all of these tests.
Occasionally, a person’s limbs or torso (the upper part of the body) may move, even after brain stem death has been diagnosed.
These spinal reflex movements are generated by the spinal cord and don’t involve the brain at all. Therefore, they won’t affect the diagnosis of brain death."

About bowel incontinence
Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It’s also sometimes known as faecal incontinence.
The experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence.
Other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind.
Some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time.
It’s thought 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it’s more common in elderly people. It’s also more common in women than men.
Why bowel incontinence happens
Bowel incontinence is a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition.
Many cases are caused by
diarrhoea
,
constipation
, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus.
It can also be caused by long-term conditions such as
diabetes
,
multiple sclerosis
and
dementia
.
Read more about the
causes of bowel incontinence
.
Seeking advice and treatment
Bowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP.
It’s important to remember that:
bowel incontinence isn’t something to be ashamed of – it’s simply a medical problem that’s no different from diabetes or asthma
it can be treated – there’s a wide range of successful treatments
bowel incontinence isn’t a normal part of ageing
it won’t usually go away on its own – most people need treatment for the condition
If you don’t want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence.

How bowel incontinence is treated
In many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life.
Treatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include:
lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea
exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the bowel
medication to control diarrhoea and constipation
surgery, of which there are a number of different options
Incontinence products
, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled.
Even if it isn’t possible to cure your bowel incontinence, symptoms should improve significantly.
Read more about
treating bowel incontinence
.
Causes of bowel incontinence
Bowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel.
The most common problems are:
problems with the rectum – the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it’s time to go to the toilet
problems with the sphincter muscles – the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don’t work properly
nerve damage – the nerve signals sent from the rectum don’t reach the brain
These problems are explained in more detail below.
It’s important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there’s a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as
bowel cancer
.
Problems with the rectum
Constipation
Constipation
is a leading cause of bowel incontinence.
In cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them.
Watery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and happens most commonly in elderly people.
Repeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence.
Diarrhoea
It’s difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with
diarrhoea
(particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence.
Conditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include:
Crohn’s disease
– inflammation of the digestive system
irritable bowel syndrome
– a condition that causes a range of digestive problems, such as diarrhoea and bloating
ulcerative colitis
– inflammation of the large bowel
These conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence.
Haemorrhoids
Haemorrhoids
(piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus.
In severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence.
Problems with the sphincter muscles
The sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged.
Childbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. During a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. Other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother’s back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour.
Sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery.
Nerve damage
Bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles.
Damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including:
diabetes
multiple sclerosis
(a condition of the central nervous system)
stroke
spina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system)
An injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence.
Other health conditions
In some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as
dementia
or a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control.
A physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time.
Diagnosing bowel incontinence
Your GP will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet.
You may find this embarrassing, but it’s important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to make sure you receive the most suitable treatment. Let your doctor know about:
any changes in your bowel habits lasting for more than a few weeks
rectal bleeding
stomach pains
any changes to your diet
any medication you’re taking
Your GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They’ll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out a rectal examination, inserting a gloved finger into your bottom.
A rectal examination will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working.
Depending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests.
Further tests
Endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy)
During an endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also be taken of the inside of your body.
The endoscope checks whether there’s any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum.
An endoscopy isn’t painful, but it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you.
Anal manometry
Anal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working.
The test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end. It’s inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it’s not uncomfortable or painful.
The device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon.
You’ll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working.
If the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don’t feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum.
Ultrasound
An
ultrasound scan
can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles.
Defecography
Defecography is a test used to study how you pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or
prolapse
that haven’t been discovered during a rectal examination.
During this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to highlight problems using an
X-ray
. Once the barium is in place, you’ll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken.
This test is occasionally carried out using a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner
instead of an X-ray.
Treating bowel incontinence
Treatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms.
Trying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended.
Medication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven’t worked.
Continence products
You may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS.
Anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they’re not really a long term solution.
If the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string.
Disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence.
Single-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence.
Your local NHS continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don’t usually need a referral from your GP to make an appointment. These clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment.
When you’re out
Wear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons.
Disability Rights UK
offers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the UK with a
Radar NKS key
. The key costs £4.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition.
Dietary changes
Bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet.
It may be beneficial to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms.
Diarrhoea
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence.
The advice from NICE includes the following:
limit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds)
avoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables
limit fresh and dried fruit to 3 portions a day and fruit juice to 1 small glass a day (make up the recommended ‘5 a day’ with vegetables)
limit how often you have fizzy drinks and drinks containing caffeine
avoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgers
Constipation
A high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you.
Fibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include:
fruit and vegetables
beans
wholegrain rice
wholewheat pasta
wholemeal bread
seeds, nuts and oats
Drink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass.
Pelvic floor muscle training
Pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles.
A therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened.
You’ll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3 times a day, for 6 to 8 weeks. After this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms.
Exercises to try
Check with your health professional before trying these at home.
First, pretend you’re trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten.
Next, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart.
Squeeze your pelvic floor muscles for as long as you can, then relax. Repeat 5 times.
Squeeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. Repeat 5 times.
Squeeze the muscles quickly, then relax. Repeat 5 times.
If you find these exercises too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine.
Bowel retraining
Bowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation.
There are 3 goals in bowel retraining:
to improve the consistency of your stools
to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels
to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves
Changes to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above).
Establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means finding the most convenient time when you can go to the toilet without being rushed.
Ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger.
Biofeedback
Biofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom.
The sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer.
You’re then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you are performing the exercises in the right way.
Medication
Medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence.
Loperamide is a medicine widely used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time.
Laxatives
are used to treat constipation. They’re a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended. These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction.
Enemas or rectal irrigation
Rectal irrigation or enemas are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum.
These procedures involve a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum.
Surgery
Surgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried.
The main surgical treatments used on the NHS are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. Other treatments – such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery – can also be used, but their availability on the NHS is limited.
An operation called a
colostomy
is more widely available on the NHS, but it’s only used if other treatments are unsuccessful.
Sphincteroplasty
A sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger.
Sacral nerve stimulation
Sacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles.
Electrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. The generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively.
At first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. If the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back.
The most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct.
Read the NICE guidelines on
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence
.
Tibial nerve stimulation
Tibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.
A fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot. A mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. It’s not known exactly how this treatment works, but it’s thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation.
NICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.
Read the NICE guidelines on
Treating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve
.
Injectable bulking agents
Bulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them.
The use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there’s little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety.
You should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed.
Read the NICE guidelines on
Treating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents
.
Endoscopic heat therapy
Endoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.
Heat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently produced guidelines on this procedure. NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.
As well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials.
Read the NICE guidelines on
Treating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy
.
Artificial sphincter
An artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles.
This operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus. The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed.
A tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in women it’s placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin.
The pump is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes.
The use of an artificial sphincter is a relatively new procedure, so there isn’t much good-quality information about its long-term effectiveness and safety.
Possible problems include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems.
Read the NICE guidelines on
Treating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen
.
Colostomy
A
colostomy
is usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful.
A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening."

About breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.
Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases,
men can also get breast cancer
.
If it’s treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.
The breasts
The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.
The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they’re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.
Read more about the
causes of breast cancer
Symptoms of breast cancer
Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.
Most breast lumps aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:
a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood)
a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
dimpling on the skin of your breasts
a rash on or around your nipple
a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast
Breast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer.
Learn more about the
symptoms of breast cancer
After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a
biopsy
.

how breast cancer is diagnosed
Types of breast cancer
There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.
Non-invasive breast cancer
Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn’t developed the ability to spread outside the breast.
This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
Invasive breast cancer
Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn’t necessarily mean it has spread.
The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called ‘no special type’.
Other types of breast cancer
Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and
Paget’s disease of the breast
.
It’s possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it’s known as ‘secondary’ or ‘metastatic’ breast cancer.
Breast cancer screening
There’s a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it’s vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.
Mammographic screening (where
X-ray
images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.
Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.
As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years.
Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.
The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73.

Treating breast cancer
If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.
Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery,
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you’ll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.
The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.
In a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it’s spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn’t curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief).

treating breast cancer
Preventing breast cancer
As the causes of breast cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.
If you’re at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.
Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a
healthy weight
,
exercise regularly
and who have a low intake of saturated
fat
and
alcohol
.
It’s been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you’ve been through the menopause, it’s particularly important that you’re not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.

preventing breast cancer
Living with breast cancer
Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it’s at and what treatment you’re having.
How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:
your family and friends can be a powerful support system
you can communicate with other people in the same situation
find out as much as possible about your condition
don’t try to do too much or overexert yourself
make time for yourself
Read more about
living with breast cancer
Symptoms of breast cancer
The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.
Most breast lumps (90%) aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor.
You should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:
a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast
a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood)
a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
dimpling on the skin of your breasts
a rash on or around your nipple
a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast
Breast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer.

Breast awareness
It’s important to be breast aware, so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot potential problems.

Causes and risk factors of breast cancer
The causes of breast cancer aren’t fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.
However, there are risk factors that are known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can’t do anything about, but there are some you can change.
Age
The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the
menopause
. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.
All women who are 50 to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.
Read more about
breast screening
Family history
If you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or
ovarian cancer
, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it’s possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.
Most cases of breast cancer aren’t hereditary (they don’t run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It’s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
If you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you’re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP.
Read about
predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes
Previous diagnosis of breast cancer
If you’ve previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.
Previous benign breast lump
A
benign breast lump
doesn’t mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.
Breast density
Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.
Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.
Exposure to oestrogen
The female hormone, oestrogen, can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start
puberty
, to regulate your periods.
Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your
periods
at a young age and experienced the menopause at a late age, you’ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.
Being overweight or obese
If you’ve experienced the menopause and are overweight or
obese
, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.
Being tall
If you’re taller than average, you’re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who’s shorter than average. The reason for this isn’t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.
Alcohol
Your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the
amount of alcohol you drink
.
Radiation
Certain medical procedures that use radiation, like
X-rays
and
computerised tomography (CT) scans
, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.
If you had
radiotherapy
to your chest area for
Hodgkin lymphoma
when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. Speak to your GP if you weren’t contacted, or if you didn’t attend a consultation.
If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.

Diagnosing breast cancer
If you have suspected breast cancer, either because of your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you’ll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.
What to expect at the breast clinic
The tests you’ll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you’ll have when you arrive. Many people don’t need any further tests after the initial examination.
Most of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.
Mammogram and breast ultrasound
If you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you’ll meet a specialist who’ll examine you to determine if you need further tests.
If you’re under 40 years of age, the specialist may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn’t as effective as an ultrasound for diagnosing breast disease.
If you have a mammogram, it will produce an
X-ray
of your breasts. You may also need an
ultrasound scan
.
Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.
Read more about breast screening
Biopsy
A
biopsy
is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it’s cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.
Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition. Different methods of carrying out a biopsy are discussed below.
Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.
Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You’ll have a
local anaesthetic
, which means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.
Your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.

Further tests for breast cancer
If a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.
If your cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you’ll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.
Scans and X-rays
Computerised tomography (CT) scans
, or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.
If your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it’s been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.
Tests to determine specific types of treatment
You’ll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.
In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.
If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as ‘hormone therapy’.
During a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they’re known as ‘hormone receptor positive’.
While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as ‘biological’ or ‘targeted’ therapy.
Stage and grade of breast cancer
Stage of breast cancer
When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer:
stage 1 – the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren’t affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
stage 2 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
stage 3 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
stage 4 – the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)
This is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you’re not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.
TNM staging system
The TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
Grade of breast cancer
The grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.
low grade (G1) – the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly
medium grade (G2) – the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells
high grade (G3) – the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK: TNM breast cancer staging
Cancer Research UK: Stages and grades of breast cancer
Treating breast cancer
Surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.
Surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you’ll have will depend on your type of breast cancer.
Your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.
Secondary breast cancer
Most breast cancers are discovered in the condition’s early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it’s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).
If this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called ‘advanced’ or ‘metastatic’ cancer, isn’t curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).
Read further information about secondary breast cancer
Surgery
There are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. They are:
surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery
surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a
mastectomy
In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.
Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.
Breast-conserving surgery
Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where up to a quarter of the breast is removed.
If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the:
type of cancer you have
size of the tumour and where it is in your breast
amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed
size of your breasts
Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there’s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there’s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.
After having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.
Mastectomy
A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.
If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).
Reconstruction
Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.
Read further information about breast reconstruction
Lymph node surgery
To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out.
The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They’re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they’re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.
The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.
If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It’s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.
If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You’ll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.
The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:
breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue
chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall
breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)
radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes
The side effects of radiotherapy include:
irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
lymphoedema (excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)
Read further information about radiotherapy for breast cancer
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It’s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven’t been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
Several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it’s spread.
Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.
In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.
The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include:
infections
loss of appetite
nausea and vomiting
tiredness
hair loss
sore mouth
Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.
Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.
If you haven’t experienced the menopause, your periods may stop while you’re undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you’ve finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.
However, this doesn’t always happen and you may enter an
early menopause
. This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because they’re closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.
Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer
If your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won’t cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.
Read further information about chemotherapy for breast cancer
Hormone treatment
Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.
These types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.
The type of hormone therapy you’ll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it’s sensitive to, your age, whether you’ve experienced the menopause and what other type of treatment you’re having.
You’ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it’s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.
Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
In most cases, you’ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after having surgery. If your breast cancer isn’t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It’s taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including:
tiredness
changes to your periods
nausea and vomiting
hot flushes
aching joints
headaches
weight gain
Aromatase inhibitors
If you’ve experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.
Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include:
hot flushes and sweats
lack of interest in sex (loss of libido)
nausea and vomiting
tiredness
aching joints and bone pain
headaches
skin rashes
Ovarian ablation or suppression
In women who haven’t experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.
Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It stops the ovaries working permanently and means you’ll experience the menopause early.
Ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you’re taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.
If you’re approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.
Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:
hot flushes and sweats
mood swings
trouble sleeping

Biological therapy (targeted therapy)
Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.
If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin, is usually used after chemotherapy.
Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.
Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It’s also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).
You will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you’ll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.
Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as
angina
, uncontrolled
high blood pressure (hypertension)
or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll have regular tests on your heart to make sure it’s not causing any problems.
Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:
an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever
diarrhoea
tiredness
aches and pains
Clinical trials
A great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.
These advances were discovered in
clinical trials
, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.
All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they’re worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those in routine care.
If you’re asked to take part in a trial, you’ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Psychological help
Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.
It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.
There are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you’re feeling depressed, talk to your GP. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.
It can help to talk to someone who’s been through the same thing as you. Many organisations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who’ve had cancer treatment.

Complementary therapies
Complementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing. They’re given alongside conventional treatments and include relaxation techniques, massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture.
Complementary therapy can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide a break from the treatment plan.
Your hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can get them. It’s important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use, to make sure it doesn’t interfere with your conventional treatment.

Living with breast cancer
Recovery
Most women with breast cancer have an operation as part of their treatment. Getting back to normal after surgery can take some time. It’s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover.
During this time, avoid lifting things – for example, children or heavy shopping bags – and avoid heavy housework. You may also be advised not to drive.
Read more about
recovering from an operation
Some other treatments, particularly
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.
Follow-up
After your treatment has finished, you’ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every 3 months for the first year.
If you’ve had early breast cancer, your healthcare team will agree a care plan with you after your treatment has finished. This plan contains the details of your follow-up. You will receive a copy of the plan, which will also be sent to your GP.
During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may carry out
blood tests
or
X-rays
to see how your cancer is responding to treatment. You should also be offered a mammogram every year for the first 5 years after your treatment.
Long-term complications
Although it’s rare, your treatment for breast cancer may cause new problems, such as:
pain and stiffness in your arms and shoulders may occur after surgery, and the skin in these areas may be tight
lymphoedema
(a build-up of excess lymph fluid which causes swelling) – this may occur if surgery or radiotherapy damages the lymphatic drainage system in the armpit
Talk to your healthcare team if you experience these or any other long-term effects of treatment.

Dealing with changes to your body
A diagnosis of breast cancer may change how you think about your body. All women react differently to the bodily changes that happen as a result of breast cancer treatment. Some women react positively, but others find it more difficult to cope. It’s important to give yourself time to come to terms with any changes to your body.

Early menopause
Although most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50 who have experienced the
menopause
, some younger women have to cope with early menopause brought on by cancer treatment.
Symptoms can include hot flushes, vaginal dryness and
loss of sexual desire
. Talk to your healthcare team about any symptoms you have and they’ll be able to help.

Prosthesis
A breast prosthesis is an artificial breast, which can be worn inside your bra to replace the breast that’s been removed.
Soon after a mastectomy, you’ll be given a lightweight foam breast to wear until the area affected by surgery or radiotherapy has healed. After it’s healed, you’ll be offered a silicone prosthesis. Prostheses come in many different shapes and sizes, and you should be able to find one that suits you.

Reconstruction
If you didn’t have immediate breast reconstruction (carried out at the time of a mastectomy), you can have reconstruction later. This is called a delayed reconstruction.
There are 2 main methods of breast reconstruction – reconstruction using your own tissue and reconstruction using an implant. The type that’s most suitable for you will depend on many factors, including the treatment you’ve had, any ongoing treatment and the size of your breasts. Talk to your healthcare team about which reconstruction is suitable for you.

breast reconstruction
Relationships with friends and family
It’s not always easy to talk about
cancer
, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you.
Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. However, don’t be afraid to tell them that you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you need.

Healthtalk: How breast cancer affects families
Your sex life
Breast cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. It’s common for women to lose interest in sex after breast cancer treatment. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer. You may be upset by the changes to your body or grieve the loss of your breasts or, in some cases, your fertility.
It’s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that aren’t getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.

Money and financial support
If you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially.
If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support, for example:
if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer
if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or if you have a low household income
Find out what help is available to you as soon as possible. The social worker at your hospital will be able to give you the information you need.
Talk to other people
Your GP or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about your cancer or treatment. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have breast cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom.

Preventing breast cancer
As the causes of breast cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not known if it can be prevented altogether.
Some treatments are available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition than the general population.
Diet and lifestyle
Regular exercise
and a
healthy, balanced diet
are recommended for all women because they can help prevent many conditions, including
heart disease
,
diabetes
and many forms of
cancer
.
Regular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. If you have been through the
menopause
, it’s particularly important that you’re not overweight or
obese
. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.
Breastfeeding
Studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t. The reasons aren’t fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they’re
breastfeeding
and oestrogen levels remain stable.
Treatments to reduce your risk
If you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.
Your level of risk is determined by factors such as your age, your family’s medical history and the results of genetic tests.
You will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it’s thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Healthcare professionals working at these services should discuss treatment options with you.
The 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication.
Mastectomy
A
mastectomy
is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.
By removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.
However, like all operations, there’s a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.
If you want to, you can usually choose to have
breast reconstruction
either during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.
An alternative is to use breast prostheses. These are artificial breasts that can be worn inside your bra.
Read more about
your body and your breasts after treatment
Medication
In 2013, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who’ve been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t.
These medications may not be suitable if in the past you’ve had blood clots or
womb cancer
, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future.
Women who’ve already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small.
A course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.
Raloxifene can cause side effects including
flu-like symptoms
, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods, and nausea and vomiting.
Your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery.
Tamoxifen and raloxifene aren’t currently licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks, and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.

About bowel cancer
Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.
Cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.
Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK.
Signs and symptoms
The 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit – such as more frequent, looser stools – and
abdominal (tummy) pain
.
However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by
haemorrhoids
(piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten.
As almost 9 out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.
Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of symptoms:
a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools
a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain
blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage
abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss
The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don’t necessarily make you feel ill.
When to seek medical advice
Read about the
symptoms of bowel cancer
, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.
Your doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.
They may also arrange for a simple blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia. This can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven’t been aware of.
In some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.
Make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.

Who’s at risk?
It’s not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include:
age – almost 9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over
diet – a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk
weight – bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese
exercise – being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer
alcohol and smoking – a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer
family history – having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer under the age of 50 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition
Some people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe
ulcerative colitis
or
Crohn’s disease
, over a long period of time.

causes of bowel cancer
and

Bowel cancer screening
Bowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.
Bowel screening involves taking a
simple test
at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.
Read more about
screening for bowel cancer
Treatment
Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.
The main treatments are:
surgery – the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need
chemotherapy
– where medication is used to kill cancer cells
radiotherapy
– where radiation is used to kill cancer cells
biological treatments – a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading
As with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far it has advanced by the time it is diagnosed.

However, these symptoms are very common. Blood in the stools is usually caused by

In the UK, an estimated 7 million people have blood in the stools each year. Even more people have temporary changes in their bowel habits and abdominal pain. Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer.
As the vast majority of people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. These symptoms are also more significant when they persist in spite of simple treatments.

Bowel obstruction
In some cases, bowel cancer can stop digestive waste passing through the bowel. This is known as a bowel obstruction.
Symptoms of a bowel obstruction can include:
severe abdominal pain, which may initially come and go
not being able to pass stools when you go to the toilet
noticeable swelling or bloating of the tummy
vomiting
A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency. If you suspect your bowel is obstructed, you should see your GP quickly. If this isn’t possible, go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital.

Causes of bowel cancer
Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
Most cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. These clumps are known as
polyps
. However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer.
Exactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. However, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it.
Age
Your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost 9 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.
Family history
Having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50.
If you are particularly concerned that your family’s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP.
If necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.
Diet
A large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.
For this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day.
Read more about
red meat and bowel cancer risk
There is also evidence that suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel cancer risk.

Smoking
People who smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop bowel cancer, other types of cancer, and other serious conditions, such as
heart disease
.

stopping smoking
Alcohol
Drinking alcohol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts.

Obesity
Being overweight or
obese
is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men.
If you are overweight or obese,
losing weight
may help lower your chances of developing the condition.
Inactivity
People who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer.
You can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being physically active every day.
Read more about
health and fitness
Digestive disorders
Some conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. For example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe
Crohn’s disease
or
ulcerative colitis
for many years.
If you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop.
Check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope – a long, narrow flexible tube that contains a small camera – that is inserted into your rectum.
The frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.
Genetic conditions
There are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are:
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) – a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel
hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome – an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk
Although the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50.
As people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25.
Families affected can find support and advice from FAP registries such as
The Polyposis Registry
provided by St Mark’s Hospital, London.
Removing the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with HNPCC because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high.

Bowel Cancer UK: Risk factors

Diagnosing bowel cancer
When you first see your GP, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer.
They will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (DRE).
This is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. The tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute.
If your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you will be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy.
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.
To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
suspected cancer: recognition and referral
.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy
A flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope.
A sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. It is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel.
The camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take
biopsies
, where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis.
It is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema – a simple procedure to flush your bowels – at home beforehand. This should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment.
A sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination.
More detailed tests
Most people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon.
The two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (CT) colonography.
Colonoscopy
A colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope, which is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer.
Your bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed, so you will be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and take a
laxative
(medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination.
You will be given a sedative to help you relax during the test, after which the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. This is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable.
The camera relays images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. As with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test.
A colonoscopy usually takes about an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative.
After the procedure, you will probably feel drowsy for a while, so you will need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. It is best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. You will be advised not to drive for 24 hours.
In a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel, and it is then necessary to have CT colonography.
Find out more about what a
colonoscopy
involves
CT colonography
CT colonography, also known as a ‘virtual colonoscopy’, involves using a
computerised tomography (CT) scanner
to produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum.
During the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. CT scans are then taken from a number of different angles.
As with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out.
This test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy because of other medical reasons.
A CT colonography is a less invasive test than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied.

Further tests
If a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body. These tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you.
These tests can include a:
CT scan of your abdomen and chest – this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectum
Staging and grading
Once the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer.
Staging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. Grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is and how likely it is to spread.
This is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer.
A number of different staging systems are used by doctors.
stage 1 – the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum
stage 2 – the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs
stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes
stage 4 – the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver
There are 3 grades of bowel cancer:
grade 1 – a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel
grade 2 – a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel
grade 3 – a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel
If you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor.
Treating bowel cancer
If colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision.
If the cancer spreads into muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon. This is known as a colectomy.
There are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed:
an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon
a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy – where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon
During surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. It is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed.
Both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications.
However, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. It is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations.
Laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.
Surgery for rectal cancer
There are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread.
Some of the main techniques used are described below:
Local resection
If you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection).
The surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum.
Total mesenteric excision
In many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed.
This area will include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue from around the bowel (the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME).
Removing the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage.
Depending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out.
Low anterior resection
Low anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum.
The surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed.
They will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum.
You will probably require a temporary stoma to give the joined section of bowel time to heal.
Abdominoperineal resection
Abdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum.
In this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area.
This involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation.
Bowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible.
Stoma surgery
Where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal.
The stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin – this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool.
When the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an
ileostomy
, and when it is made from the large bowel (colon) it is called a
colostomy
.
A specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma prior to surgery.
The nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency.
In the first few days after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable.
Once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed during further surgery.
In some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent.
Before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent.
There are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups online for further information.

provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery

coping with a stoma after bowel cancer
Side effects of surgery
Bowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems.
The operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. One risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation.
Another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves.
After rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although this usually settles down within a few months of the operation.
Radiotherapy
There are 2 main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. It can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy).
Radiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in 2 ways:
external radiotherapy
– where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells
internal radiotherapy
(brachytherapy) – where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it
External radiotherapy is usually given daily, 5 days a week, with a break at the weekend. Depending on the size of your tumour, you may need 1 to 5 weeks of treatment. Each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes.
Internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later.
Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days.
Short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:
feeling sick
fatigue
diarrhoea
burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis – this looks and feels like sunburn
a frequent need to urinate
a burning sensation when passing urine
These side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. Additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects better.
Long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:
a more frequent need to pass urine or stools
blood in your urine and stools
infertility
erectile dysfunction
If you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.
Chemotherapy
There are 3 ways
chemotherapy
can be used to treat bowel cancer:
before surgery – used in combination with radiotherapy to shrink the tumour
after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring
palliative chemotherapy – to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms
Chemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both.
Treatment is given in courses (cycles) that are 2 to 3 weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer.
A single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days.
Most people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week.
A course of chemotherapy can last up to 6 months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. In some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy).
Side effects of chemotherapy can include:
fatigue
feeling sick
vomiting
diarrhoea
mouth ulcers
hair loss
with certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer
a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck
These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. It usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss.
Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.
Inform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell.
Medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men’s sperm and women’s eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby’s health.
It is therefore recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished.

chemotherapy
Biological treatments
Biological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies.
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR).
As EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy.
Biological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer).
These treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has specific criteria that need to be met before these can be prescribed.
Cetuximab is only available on the NHS when:
surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible
bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically
a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab
Cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the Cancer Drugs Fund. All these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive.

Living with bowel cancer
Talk to others
Your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP surgery will have information on these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to others with bowel cancer at a local support group or through an internet chat room.
Beating Bowel Cancer
offers support services to people with bowel cancer. They run a nurse advisory line on
08450 719 301
or
020 8973 0011
available 9am to 5.30pm Monday to Thursday, and 9am to 4pm on Fridays. You can also email a nurse at
nurse@beatingbowelcancer.org
.
The organisation also runs a national patient-to-patient network called Bowel Cancer Voices for people affected by bowel cancer and their relatives.

Your emotions
Having cancer can cause a range of emotions. These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression.
Different people deal with serious problems in different ways. It is hard to predict how knowing you have cancer will affect you.
However, you and your loved ones may find it helpful to know about the feelings that people diagnosed with cancer have reported.
Read about the emotional effects of cancer
Recovering from surgery
Surgeons and anaesthetists have found using an enhanced recovery programme after bowel cancer surgery helps patients recover more quickly.
Most hospitals now use this programme. It involves giving you more information about what to expect before the operation, avoiding giving you strong
laxatives
to clean the bowel before surgery, and in some cases giving you a sugary drink two hours before the operation to give you energy.
During and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of IV fluid you need very carefully, and after the operation you will be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day.
Most people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation.
To reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs
(deep vein thrombosis)
, you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called heparin until you are fully mobile.
A nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so you can go home within a few days.
With the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. The timing depends on when you and the doctors and nurses looking after you agree you are well enough to go home.
You will be asked to return to hospital a few weeks after your treatment has finished so tests can be carried out to check for any remaining signs of cancer. You may also need routine check-ups for the next few years to look out for signs of the cancer recurring.
Diet after bowel surgery
If you have had part of your colon removed, it is likely your stools (faeces) will be looser – one of the functions of the colon is to absorb water from stools.
This may mean you need to go to the toilet more often to pass loose stools. Inform your care team if this becomes a problem, as medication is available to help control it.
You may find some foods upset your bowels, particularly during the first few months after your operation.
Different foods can upset different people. Food and drink known to cause problems include:
fruit and vegetables that are high in fibre, such as beans, cabbages, apples and bananas
fizzy drinks, such as cola and beer
You may find it useful to keep a food diary to record the effects of different foods on your bowel.
Contact your care team if you find you are having continual problems with your bowels as a result of your diet, or you are finding it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. You may need to be referred to a dietitian for further advice.

diet after treatment.
Living with a stoma
If you need a temporary or permanent stoma with an external bag or pouch, you may feel worried about how you look and how others will react to you.
Information and advice about living with a stoma – including stoma care, stoma products and stoma-friendly diets – is available on the
ileostomy
and
colostomy
topics.
For those who want further information about living with a stoma, there are patient support groups that provide support for people who may have had, or are due to have a stoma.
You can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit support groups online for further information. The
Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group
organisation provide a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery.
Sex and bowel cancer
Having cancer and receiving treatment may affect how you feel about relationships and sex. Although most people are able to enjoy a normal sex life after bowel cancer treatment, you may feel self-conscious or uncomfortable if you have a stoma.
Talking about how you feel with your partner may help you both support each other. Or you may feel you’d like to talk to someone else about your feelings. Your doctor or nurse will be able to help.

body image and intimate relations
Financial concerns
A diagnosis of cancer can cause money problems because you are unable to work, or someone you are close to has to stop working to look after you.
There is financial support available for carers and yourself if you have to stay off work for a while or stop work because of your illness.

Preventing bowel cancer
There are some things that increase your risk of bowel cancer that you can’t change, such as your family history or your age.
However, there are several ways you can lower your chances of developing the condition.
Diet
It may help prevent bowel cancer if you eat:
less cured and processed meat, such as bacon, sausages and ham
less red meat and more fish
more fibre from cereals, beans, fruit and vegetables
The Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day to cut down to 70g to help reduce their bowel cancer risk.
Read more about
red meat and bowel cancer risk
and
eating good food and a healthy diet
Exercise
Regular exercise can lower the risk of developing bowel and other cancers.
It’s recommended adults exercise for at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.
Read more about
keeping active
Healthy weight
Being overweight or obese increases your chances of developing bowel cancer, so you should try to maintain a healthy weight if you want to lower your risk.
You can find out if you are a healthy weight by using the
BMI chart
Changes to your diet and an increase in your physical activity will help keep your weight under control.
Read more about
losing weight
Stop smoking
If you smoke, stopping can reduce your risk of developing bowel and other cancers.
Quit Your Way Scotland
is an advice and support service for anyone trying to stop smoking in Scotland. To speak with an advisor, phone 0800 84 84 84 from 8am to 10pm, every day. Calls are free from landlines and mobiles.
Your GP or pharmacist can also provide help, support and advice if you want to give up smoking.
Read more about
stopping smoking
Cut down on alcohol
Drinking alcohol has been linked to an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, so you may be able to reduce your risk by cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink.
If you drink most weeks, to reduce your risk of harming your health:
men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week

tips on cutting down
Bowel cancer screening
Although screening cannot stop you getting bowel cancer, it can allow the condition to be detected at an earlier stage, when it is much easier to treat.
As well as making lifestyle changes and keeping an eye out for possible
symptoms of bowel cancer
, taking part in bowel cancer screening when it is offered can help reduce your chances of dying from the condition.
Bowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland. If you’re 75 or over, you can still take a bowel screening test every 2 years. However, you’ll need to request a new test kit each time.

The brain and brain tumours
This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about the brain and different types of brain tumour.
Any illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.
The brain
The brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the ‘control centre’ which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body.
The brain and the spinal cord are covered by 3 thin layers of tissue called the meninges. Between 2 of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The meninges and CSF help to protect the brain and spinal cord.
The main parts of the brain are the:
cerebrum
cerebellum
brain stem
pituitary gland
Cerebrum
This is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It’s made up of 2 halves called hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. It also makes us aware of our body position.
Cerebellum
This is at the back of the head, near the middle. It controls movement, balance and coordination.
Brain stem
This connects the brain to the spinal cord. It’s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing.
Pituitary gland
This is in the middle of the brain. It makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods, and sperm production.
Types of brain tumour
There are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types.
Benign brain tumours often press on the brain but don’t usually spread into surrounding tissue. They are also less likely to spread around the brain and spinal cord. If they can be removed with an operation they may not cause any more problems. Sometimes it’s difficult to remove a benign tumour because of where it is in the brain. In this case, you might need treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Some benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. This can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain.
Malignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. They can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord.
This information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. Sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. These are known as secondary brain tumours.
The types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are:
pituitary tumours
gliomas
medulloblastomas
germ cell tumours
Gliomas
These start in cells called glial cells. There are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. These types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord.
Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas
These are the most common type of glioma.
Astrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. Oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. Sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. These are called oligoastrocytomas. Doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). They can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope.
Ependymomas
These are a rarer type of glioma. They develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. These tumours can spread to other parts of the brain and spine through the CSF.
Pituitary tumours
These are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. They are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.
Some cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. They very rarely spread.
Medulloblastomas
These usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. Sometimes they can spread through the CSF, or very rarely to other parts of the body. They start from cells that haven’t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET).
Germ cell tumours of the brain
This type of tumour is rare. They develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue.
Although germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. They may be non-cancerous or cancerous. They are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.

Symptoms and causes of brain tumours
This section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is.
The tumour can:
cause fits
affect the messages sent by that part of the brain to other parts of the body
cause ‘raised intracranial pressure’ – there’s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the brain
Common symptoms of ‘raised intracranial pressure’ are:
headaches, which are often worse in the morning
vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick
fits (seizures)
feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things like friends, school or going out
problems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double
feeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual
changes in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body
problems with speech
personality changes
There’s often a simple explanation for many of these symptoms. But if you have any of these or if you’re worried, it’s important to speak to your GP straight away.
Causes
The cause of most brain tumours is unknown. Research is looking into this all the time.
Young people with rare genetic conditions that run in families, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2, have an increased chance of developing a brain tumour.
Mobile phones, power lines and certain viruses have all been suggested as possible causes of brain tumours. There’s been a lot of research into these possible causes, especially mobile phones. But there has been no strong evidence for any of them.
Remember – nothing you’ve done has caused the tumour.
If you’re worried about brain tumours
If you think you might have any of the symptoms of a brain tumour, you should go straight to your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. They can arrange
tests
to find out more, or refer you to a specialist doctor.

Having tests for brain tumours
This section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.
Seeing your GP
Your GP will examine you and, depending on your symptoms, they may arrange some tests. Or they might send you to hospital straight away to see a doctor who specialises in problems to do with the brain. These doctors are called neurologists or neurosurgeons.
Sometimes a brain tumour is diagnosed after someone has been taken into hospital to check out symptoms that have happened suddenly, like having a fit.
At the hospital
You’ll usually be seen at a hospital with a centre or unit specialising in treating brain tumours.
Your specialist will ask you questions about your symptoms and how you’ve been feeling. They’ll examine the back of your eyes using an instrument with a light on the end of it to check for swelling. Swelling can be a sign of raised pressure in your head.
They’ll usually check:
your balance
your coordination
your muscle strength
your reflexes
whether you can feel pinpricks on areas of your skin
You might also have your eyesight and hearing tested.
Tests
You’ll need to have some more tests before a diagnosis is made. Your doctor will select the most suitable tests for your situation. These tests are important because they help your specialist plan the best treatment for you. Your doctor and specialist nurse will explain things to you, but don’t be afraid to ask questions.
Macmillan Cancer Support has information on the possible tests, which include:
a
CT scan
or
MRI scan
– these show a detailed picture of the inside of your head
blood tests
– these are done to check your general health and sometimes to measure the level of certain chemicals or hormones in your blood
lumbar punctures – in this test a small needle is used to collect some fluid from the base of your spine; it’s sometimes done to look for cancer cells in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord
X-rays
– might be taken to check your skull and chest
Having a biopsy
Doctors often need to remove a small part of the tumour (
biopsy
) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. The piece of tumour that’s removed is looked at under a microscope by a doctor called a pathologist. The operation will be done under
general anaesthetic
. This is where you are put into a deep sleep. You’ll probably be in hospital for a few days.
An
MRI
or
CT scan
is used to find the exact position of the tumour. The surgeon makes a small hole in the skull and passes a fine needle through it to remove a piece of the tumour.
Guided biopsy
This is often used to make sure the doctor takes the biopsy from the most appropriate part of the tumour. You will have a head frame fitted that will help guide the surgeon to exactly the right place before they take the biopsy. This is called a stereotactic biopsy.
Tests and waiting for results
Having tests and waiting for results can be scary. Remember – you don’t have to keep your worries to yourself. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. You could also talk to one of Macmillan’s
cancer support specialists
on their free helpline.

section.
Treating brain tumours
This section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.
A team of specialists will plan your treatment. They will talk to you about the best treatment for you.
It’s normal to have a combination of treatments, so you may be seen by different doctors, such as:
a neurosurgeon, who specialises in brain operations
a neurologist, who treats brain conditions
a cancer specialist (oncologist), who treats brain tumours with radiotherapy and chemotherapy
You’ll usually see a specialist nurse who looks after people with conditions affecting the brain, or a specialist nurse for teenagers or young adults with cancer. If you have radiotherapy (X-ray treatment) you will be given this treatment by a radiographer.
There are different types of brain tumours, so treatment won’t be the same for everyone. Your doctors look at the type of brain tumour you have, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment for you.
The main treatments for brain tumours are:
surgery – an operation to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour
radiotherapy
– uses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells
chemotherapy
– uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells
Your specialist doctor and nurse will explain your treatment and answer any questions you have. It’s important you understand what’s involved. You’ll probably need some time to talk it through with your family.
Medicines you may need to take
You might need to take these medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:
steroids, which can reduce swelling or inflammation in the brain and help with symptoms
anticonvulsant medicines that help prevent fits (seizures)
Surgery for brain tumours
Your surgeon will usually try to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour. Before the operation, they will talk to you about what’s involved and the benefits and risks of the operation. It’s important you understand all this, so ask all the questions you want to.
You’ll usually be in hospital for a week, sometimes longer. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what to expect before and after the operation as it can be different for everyone.
Before the operation you’ll probably need to have some of your hair shaved off. This is done in the anaesthetic room. You may prefer to have all your hair shaved off. You can cover up with a wig or hat while it grows back.
For some types of brain tumours, particularly low-grade gliomas, your surgeon might suggest doing an operation while you are awake. This is called an ‘awake craniotomy’. If you need this, you will be given plenty of medication to make sure it doesn’t hurt.
Sometimes surgery is not needed, or it’s not possible to remove the tumour. Your specialist may think that another treatment would be better for you. They will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions to help you understand your options.
What happens after the operation?
After the operation you are monitored very closely for the first 12 to 24 hours. At first you might be attached to a machine called a ventilator that helps you breathe. Your nurse or doctor will tell you if this is likely to happen.
Your head might be bandaged and you’ll have a tube draining any extra blood that’s collected around the wound into a plastic bottle. You may also have another tube draining extra cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain). This is to make sure you don’t get too much pressure building up inside your brain. Your doctor will remove these tubes as soon as it’s safe, usually after a couple of days.
You’ll have a drip to give you fluids until you’re eating and drinking again. There may be some swelling and bruising around your face and eyes. This will settle down after a few days.
When you wake up you might have a headache. You’ll be given painkillers regularly until this eases off. Tell your nurse or doctor if you’re in pain so that they can give you something stronger.
Radiotherapy for brain tumours
Radiotherapy
uses high-energy X-rays to treat cancer cells. It can be used:
after the operation to treat any cells that may have been left behind
instead of an operation when a brain tumour doesn’t need to be or can’t be removed
if a brain tumour comes back after surgery
For some brain tumours, it’s normal to treat your spinal cord (the nerves that go from your brain to your body) as well as your brain. Your doctor will tell you if this is the case.
Types of radiotherapy
There are 3 types of radiotherapy that are used to treat brain tumours:
photon radiotherapy (given at your local hospital)
proton radiotherapy (until 2018/2019 this is given in Switzerland or America)
stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (given at specialist hospitals in the UK)
Your doctor will discuss with you which treatment would be best.
You’ll have your treatment in the radiotherapy department of the hospital. It’s usually given Monday to Friday, with a rest at the weekend. The number of treatments you have will depend on your situation, but it can last from 1 day to 7 weeks.
You will have to wear a mask or shell to keep your head as still as possible during radiotherapy treatment. This makes sure treatment is delivered to the exact area each time. Your mask is made before your treatment is planned. You’ll be able to see and breathe properly, but it might feel a bit tight. You only have to wear it for a few minutes at a time. Most people find they get used to it pretty quickly. Let your nurse or radiographer know if you’re worried about this.
The treatment only takes a few minutes. It isn’t painful, but you need to lie very still. You’ll be on your own in the room but you can talk to the radiographer through an intercom. In some hospitals you can have music playing while you have your treatment.
Side effects
The side effects you might have will depend on the type of radiotherapy you’re having and how long it lasts for. Your doctor and specialist nurse will tell you more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects you’re having. There’s usually something they can do to make things easier.
Hair loss
Your hair in the treatment area will start to thin and fall out shortly after your treatment starts. Your doctor or nurse can show you where you will
lose your hair
.
Losing your hair can be scary and really upsetting. There are lots of ways to cover up with hats, bandannas, baseball caps, scarves, or wigs until it grows back. Getting a shorter haircut before it starts to fall out sometimes makes it a little easier to cope with.
It usually starts to grow back within 3 months of finishing treatment. Hair may grow back with a slightly different colour and texture and might not be as thick as before.
Although hair loss is usually temporary, for some people it can be permanent. Your specialist will usually be able to tell you if this is likely. This can be hard to deal with and you’ll be given advice and support to help you cope.
Skin changes
You might get some skin changes – a bit like sunburn – in the area being treated, usually after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. At first it can be dry and itchy. If you’ve got pale skin it might get red. If you’ve got darker skin it can get darker. You should wash and dry the skin gently using non-perfumed soap and use only the moisturiser that the radiographer gives you. The radiographer or specialist nurse will give you advice on looking after your skin.
Tiredness
You may feel really tired towards the end of your treatment and for a few weeks after it has finished. This gradually improves after a few weeks. Try to get plenty of rest. It’s also a good idea to do some gentle exercise if you can, like taking short walks. This helps to give you more energy and keep your muscles toned.
Feeling sick
Let your doctor know if this is a problem. They can prescribe anti-sickness medicines to help.
Headaches
It’s important to tell your doctor if you have headaches. They can prescribe pain relief for you.
During and after treatment, you might find your symptoms get a bit worse before they get better. This can be scary but it’s usually a reaction to the radiotherapy. It doesn’t mean the radiotherapy hasn’t worked or that the tumour has got worse. If it happens, let your doctor or nurse know.
Late effects
Side effects that happen months or years after treatment has finished are called late (long-term) effects. These depend on the area of the brain treated. They can include patches of hair loss, worse concentration, memory changes and difficulty learning new things, reduced hormones, increased risk of a stroke, and a second tumour.
You’ll be seen regularly for follow-up appointments and your doctors will be checking you for any late effects of treatment. Your doctors will explain more about this to you.
Chemotherapy for brain tumours
Chemotherapy
is the use of special anti-cancer drugs to destroy tumour cells. You might have chemotherapy:
to shrink a tumour to make it easier to remove with surgery
when it’s not possible to remove the tumour completely with surgery
during radiotherapy to make the tumour more sensitive to radiation
after radiotherapy or surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour coming back (adjuvant chemotherapy)
when a brain tumour has come back after treatment.
Chemotherapy drugs
Macmillan has information on the different
chemotherapy drugs
that can be used, such as:
lomustine (CCNU)
procarbazine
vincristine
cisplatin or carboplatin
temozolomide (Temodal®)
cyclophosphamide
ifosfamide
etoposide
The information on these drugs is written for people of all ages, not just for young people. There are lots of other drugs that are used and your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this.
You can also call Macmillan’s
cancer support specialists
for more information about chemotherapy drugs.
Chemotherapy can be given as a single drug or in combination with others. They can be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. Occasionally chemotherapy is given directly into the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy) or into the brain through a special device (ommaya reservoir).
Another way of giving chemotherapy is for the surgeon to place a wafer containing chemotherapy in the area of the brain where the tumour was removed during the surgery. As the wafer dissolves, the chemotherapy drug is slowly released into the area of the brain that needs treatment.|
Side effects
Chemotherapy causes side effects that usually get better when treatment is over.
Being more at risk of an infection
You need to let your doctor or nurse know immediately if you have signs of an infection like feeling hot and shivery. This is because you can become unwell quite quickly while you are on chemotherapy.
Tiredness
This is a common side effect so it’s important to get plenty of rest. Try to balance rest with some gentle exercise like short walks if you can. This helps give you more energy and keeps your muscles toned.
Feeling sick
You’ll be given anti-sickness medicines to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if the ones you’re taking aren’t working for you.
Hair loss
If you lose your hair it will usually start to grow back again after your treatment stops.
Infertility
Some chemotherapy drugs can affect your fertility. Your doctor should discuss this with you before treatment begins.
Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about the side effects to expect depending on the chemotherapy you have. Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects as there’s often something that can be done to control them.
Supportive treatment for brain tumours
As part of your treatment for a brain tumour you’ll probably be given drugs called steroids. You may also be given some anticonvulsant drugs to prevent fits.
Steroids
Steroids help reduce the swelling that often surrounds a brain tumour. Although they don’t treat the tumour itself, they can improve symptoms and make you feel better. Steroids are often given before and after surgery, and sometimes during or after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
It’s important to take steroids as your doctor tells you and not to suddenly stop them. If you take steroids for more than 2 weeks, it’s important to tell your doctor about them if you are unwell (for example an infection) over the next 6 months. This is because you may need an extra course of steroids.
Side effects
If you take steroids for some time, you may have some temporary side effects. These can include:
weight gain
a change in the shape of your face (making it more rounded)
indigestion
slightly more risk of getting an infection
mood changes (feeling ‘hyper’ or overactive or feeling low)
increase in the sugar level in your blood – your blood or urine may be tested to check for this
Side effects can be hard to cope with, especially with all the other stuff you have to deal with. Remember – the side effects will gradually get better when the steroids are stopped, and in the meantime there are lots of people who can support you.
Anticonvulsants
Tumours in the brain can sometimes cause fits. Anticonvulsant drugs can help prevent them. You might be prescribed these before surgery, or to take on a more long-term basis. Your doctors will tell you about any side effects of these drugs.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/brain-tumours-children/,"Brain tumours: Children
Brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. Children of any age may be affected. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Brain tumours
A tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). This information is about primary brain tumours.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain. Symptoms are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be. A growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain. Doctors call this raised intracranial pressure, and it can cause symptoms such as:
headaches
(often worse in the morning)
vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick
fits (seizures)
feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things
eye problems, such as abnormal eye movements, blurring or double vision feeling very tired much more quickly than usual
feeling extremely sleepy (drowsy) for no reason
Brain tumours can also cause problems with balance and walking, weakness down one side of the body, or changes in behaviour. Some of these symptoms are common even without a brain tumour, and this can cause confusion in the early stages.
The brain
The brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are 3 layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between 2 of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord.
The main parts of the brain are:
the cerebrum – this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain; it’s made up of 2 halves (hemispheres), it controls thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, emotions and touch, and it also helps us be aware of our body position
the cerebellum – this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination
the brain stem – this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck; it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing
What happens when a brain tumour is suspected
Knowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don’t be afraid to ask questions.
Your doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. This will include looking into the back of your child’s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. They’ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes.
CT or MRI scan
Most children will have a
CT
or an
MRI scan
, which looks in detail at the inside of the brain.
A CT scan uses
X-rays
. It’s quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an MRI. It uses quite a lot of X-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided.
An MRI scan uses no X-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. Machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. It is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan.
Ordinary X-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours.
Blood tests
These are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour.
Biopsy
It’s often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour (
biopsy
) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. It means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. The piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by a specialist doctor called a pathologist.
A biopsy isn’t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. In this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known.
Sometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. Part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later.
Types of brain tumours
There are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types.
Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Benign brain tumours
These remain in the part of the brain that they started in and do not usually spread into other areas. Sometimes it may be difficult to remove a benign tumour, because of where it is and, in this situation, other treatments may be needed.
The most common tumour of this type is a low-grade astrocytoma (also called low-grade glioma).
Malignant primary brain tumours
These are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by.
High-grade astrocytoma and ependymoma
These tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas.
Medulloblastomas
These usually develop in the lower part of the brain, the cerebellum. They may spread to other parts of the brain or into the spinal cord, and treatment must include the whole of this.
Treatment
Because there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. The doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment.
These are the main treatments used to treat brain tumours. Your child may have one treatment or a combination of treatments.
Surgery
Usually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Operations can be very long. It’s not uncommon for these to be more than 6 or 8 hours.
Sometimes, the fluid in and around the brain does not flow freely, as a result of the tumour or brain swelling. In this case, it may be necessary to place a fine tube (shunt) to drain excess fluid from the brain and into the lining of the tummy area (abdomen). You cannot see the shunt outside the body. Another way of treating this is to create another drainage route for the fluid around the obstruction (called a ventriculostomy).
After the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them.
Once a diagnosis is known, a plan to treat any tumour left behind can be made. For benign tumours, there may be no further treatment, but for some, radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be required.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy radiation beams. These are exactly the same as visible light, but instead of reflecting from the surface, the energy passes inside the body, where it causes damage to tumour cells.
Radiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the MRI scans of your child’s brain. The process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for 5 or 6 weeks.
Sometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. Your child’s oncologist will explain more about this.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to get rid of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given into the veins, and sometimes as a liquid or tablets by mouth. Treatment is often quite prolonged, with periods of time in hospital and gaps when you will be able to return home. This part of the treatment is planned by an oncologist.
The specialist doctor and nurse will explain your child’s treatment and answer your questions so that you understand what is involved.
Other medicines your child may need to take
Your child may need to take medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:
Steroids
These are medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation in the brain and can help with symptoms.
Anticonvulsants
These are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. They may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer.
Side effects of treatment
Your child’s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects your child is having. Many side effects can be well controlled or made easier.
Hair loss
Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause
hair loss
. Your child’s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy.
Tiredness
Tiredness is very common with both treatments and may continue for weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy finishes.
Feeling sick
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. This can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child.
Increased risk of an infection
Chemotherapy can increase the risk of infection. It’s important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straight away if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell.
Skin changes in the treated area if your child is having radiotherapy
Radiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. The skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. You’ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area.
Clinical trials
Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It’s important to realise that a clinical trial is not an ‘experiment’, and your doctor will always offer you what is believed to be the best available treatment. Clinical trials are usually offered to explore ways of making new improvements to treatment, beyond what is already known.
Specialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. You can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
After treatment is over, your child will be seen regularly by specialists. This is to check their progress and how well they’re recovering from treatment. It is also to check that they don’t have any long-term problems from treatment.
You can contact your child’s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health.
Long-term side effects
Sometimes treatments may cause possible long-term side effects that may develop later. Your child’s oncologist or specialist nurse will explain the possible risk of any long-term effects in your child’s situation. Children are monitored for any long-term problems following treatment so that they can be picked up and managed early on.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

About bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection.
The most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include:
a persistent
cough
that usually brings up phlegm (sputum)
breathlessness
The severity of symptoms can vary widely. Some people have only a few symptoms that don’t appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily symptoms.
The symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs.
Read more about the
symptoms of bronchiectasis
.
When to see your GP
You should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be caused by bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.
If your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they’ll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests.
Read more about
diagnosing bronchiectasis
.
How the lungs are affected
The lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream.
The inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs.
In bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further.
Over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs.
Why it happens
Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.
There are many reasons why this may happen. The three most common causes in the UK are:
a lung infection during childhood, such as
pneumonia
or
whooping cough
, that damages the bronchi
underlying problems with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) – an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi are inhaled
However, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis).
Read more about the
causes of bronchiectasis
.
Who is affected
Bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It’s estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition.
It can affect anyone at any age, but symptoms don’t usually develop until middle age.
Over 12,000 people were admitted to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these people were over 60 years old.
How bronchiectasis is treated
The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.
The main treatments include:
exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs
medication to help improve airflow within the lungs
antibiotics
to treat any lung infections that develop
Surgery is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments haven’t been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area and you’re in good general health.
Read more about the
treatment of bronchiectasis
.
Possible complications
Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it.
Read more about the
complications of bronchiectasis
.
Outlook
The outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause.
Living with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy. For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly.
Around 1,000 deaths reported in England and Wales each year are thought to be caused by bronchiectasis.
Information about you
If you have bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register
.
Symptoms of bronchiectasis
The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a persistent cough that brings up a large amount of phlegm on a daily basis.
The phlegm can be clear, pale yellow or yellow-greenish in colour. Other people may only occasionally cough up small amounts of phlegm, or none at all.
Other symptoms may include:
shortness of breath
wheezing
coughing up blood or blood-stained phlegm
chest pain
joint pain
clubbing of the fingertips – the tissue beneath the nail thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbous
Signs of a lung infection
If you develop a lung infection, your symptoms usually get worse within a few days. This is known as an infective exacerbation and it can cause:
coughing up even more phlegm, which may be more green than usual or smell unpleasant
worsening shortness of breath
You may also:
feel very tired
cough up blood, if you haven’t already done so
experience a sharp chest pain that’s made worse when breathing (
pleurisy
)
feel generally unwell
When to seek medical advice
If you haven’t previously been diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you develop a persistent cough, visit your GP for advice.
While persistent coughing may not necessarily be the result of bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.
If you’ve been previously diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you begin to experience symptoms that suggest you have a lung infection, contact your GP. You’ll usually need treatment with antibiotics.
Some people with bronchiectasis are given a stock of antibiotics as a precaution, in case they suddenly develop a lung infection.
When to seek immediate medical advice
Some people with bronchiectasis develop a severe lung infection that may need to be treated in hospital.
Signs and symptoms of serious lung infection include:
a bluish tinge to the skin and lips (cyanosis)
confusion
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
rapid breathing (more than 25 breaths a minute)
severe chest pain that makes it too painful to cough and clear your lungs
If you experience any of the above, phone the healthcare professional in charge of your care immediately. This may be your GP, a doctor who specialises in lung conditions (pulmonologist) or a specialist nurse.
If this isn’t possible, then phone the NHS 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service.
Causes of bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is caused by the airways of the lungs becoming damaged and widened. This can be due to an infection or another condition. Sometimes, the cause is not known.
Your lungs are continually exposed to germs, so your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection.
If a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. These cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the surrounding tissue to become inflamed.
For most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. However, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen.
The abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. If the lungs do become infected again, this can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi.
As this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse. How quickly bronchiectasis progresses can vary significantly. For some people, the condition will get worse quickly, but for many the progression is slow.
Common causes
In around half of all cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause can be found.
Some of the more common triggers that have been identified are described below.
Childhood infections
Around a third of cases of bronchiectasis in adults are associated with a severe lung infection in childhood, such as:
severe
pneumonia
whooping cough
tuberculosis (TB)
measles
However, as there are now vaccinations available for these infections, it is expected that childhood infections will become a less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.
Immunodeficiency
Around 1 in 12 cases of bronchiectasis occur because a person has a weakened immune system, which makes their lungs more vulnerable to tissue damage. The medical term for having a weakened immune system is immunodeficiency.
Some people are born with an immunodeficiency because of problems with the genes they inherit from their parents. It’s also possible to acquire an immunodeficiency after an infection such as
HIV
.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
Around 1 in 14 people with bronchiectasis develop the condition as a complication of an allergic condition known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).
People with ABPA have an allergy to a type of fungi known as aspergillus, which is found in a wide range of different environments across the world.
If a person with ABPA breathes in fungal spores, it can trigger an allergic reaction and persistent inflammation, which in turn can progress to bronchiectasis.
Aspiration
Aspiration is the medical term for stomach contents accidentally passing into your lungs, rather than down into your gastrointestinal tract. This is responsible for around 1 in 25 cases of bronchiectasis.
The lungs are very sensitive to the presence of foreign objects, such as small samples of food or even stomach acids, so this can trigger inflammation leading to bronchiectasis.
Cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis
is a relatively common genetic disorder, where the lungs become clogged up with mucus. The mucus then provides an ideal environment for a bacterial infection to take place, leading to the symptoms of bronchiectasis.
It is estimated that cystic fibrosis is responsible for around 1 in 33 cases of bronchiectasis.
Cilia abnormalities
Cilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs. They are designed to protect the airways and help move away any excess mucus. Bronchiectasis can develop if there is a problem with the cilia that means they are unable to effectively clear mucus from the airways.
Conditions that can cause problems with the cilia include:
Young’s disease – a rare condition only affecting males that is thought to be caused by exposure to mercury in childhood
primary ciliary dyskinesia – a rare condition caused by inheriting faulty genes
It’s estimated that about 1 in every 33 cases of bronchiectasis are caused by Young’s disease and 1 or 2 in every 100 cases are caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia.
However, as the regulations regarding the use of mercury are now much stricter than they were in the past, it is expected that Young’s syndrome will become a much less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.
Connective tissue diseases
Certain conditions that cause inflammation in other areas of the body are sometimes associated with bronchiectasis, including:
rheumatoid arthritis
Sjögren’s syndrome
Crohn’s disease
ulcerative colitis
These conditions are usually thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
Diagnosing bronchiectasis
You should see your GP for advice if you develop a persistent cough, so they can look for a possible cause.
Your GP will ask you about your symptoms, such as how often you cough, whether you bring up any phlegm (sputum) and whether you smoke.
They may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out. The lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise as a person breaths in and out.
You’ll also probably have a chest
X-ray
to rule out other, more serious, causes of your symptoms, such as
lung cancer
.
If your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of your phlegm, so it can be checked for bacteria.
Referral to a specialist
If your GP suspects you could have bronchiectasis, you’ll be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further testing.
The maximum time you should have to wait for referral is 18 weeks, although you may not have to wait as long as this.
Read more about waiting times.
Some of the tests a respiratory consultant may carry out to help diagnose bronchiectasis are described below.
HRCT scan
Currently, the most effective test available to diagnose bronchiectasis is called a high-resolution
computerised tomography
(HRCT) scan.
A HRCT scan involves taking several X-rays of your chest at slightly different angles. A computer is then used to put all the images together. This produces a very detailed picture of the inside of your body and the airways inside your lungs (the bronchi) should show up very clearly.
In a healthy pair of lungs, the bronchi should become narrower the further they spread into your lungs, in the same way a tree branch separates into narrower branches and twigs.
If the scan shows that a section of airways is actually getting wider, this usually confirms bronchiectasis.
Other tests
Other tests can be used to assess the state of your lungs and to try to determine what the underlying cause of your bronchiectasis may be.
These tests may include:
blood tests
– to check how well your immune system is working and check for infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi
phlegm (sputum) test – to check for bacteria or fungi
a sample of your sweat can be tested to see how much salt is in it – high levels of salt can be caused by cystic fibrosis (if this test is positive, then a more detailed genetic test can be carried out; see
diagnosing cystic fibrosis
for further information)
lung function test – a small, hand-held device (spirometer) that you blow into is used to measure how hard and how quickly you can expel air from your lungs; this can assess how well your lungs are working
bronchoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera at one end is used to look into your lungs; this is usually only required if you think you’ve inhaled a foreign object
Treating bronchiectasis
The damage to the lungs associated with bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help prevent the condition getting worse.
In most cases, treatment involves a combination of medication, exercises you can learn and devices to help clear your airways. Surgery for bronchiectasis is rare.
There are a number of things you can do to help relieve the symptoms of bronchiectasis and stop the condition getting worse, including:
stopping smoking
(if you smoke)
having the flu vaccine every year
making sure you have had the
pneumococcal vaccine
to protect against
pneumonia
exercising
regularly
keeping yourself well hydrated
eating a
balanced diet
Exercises
There are a range of exercises, known as airway clearance techniques, which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. This can often help improve coughing and breathlessness in people with bronchiectasis.
You can be referred to a physiotherpist, who can teach you these techniques.
Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT)
The most widely used technique in the UK is called active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT).
ACBT involves you repeating a cycle made up of a number of different steps. These include a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up; then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.
Don’t attempt ACBT if you haven’t first been taught the steps by a suitably trained physiotherapist, as performing the techniques incorrectly could damage your lungs.
If you’re otherwise in good health, you’ll probably only need to perform ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to perform ACBT on a more frequent basis.
Postural drainage
Changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage.
Each technique can involve several complex steps, but most techniques involve you leaning or lying down while the physiotherapist or a carer uses their hands to vibrate certain sections of your lungs as you go through a series of “huffing” and coughing.
Devices
There are also a number of handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs.
Although these devices look different, most work in a similar way. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus.
Examples of these devices include the flutter, the RC cornet and the Acapella.
However, these devices aren’t always available on the NHS, so you may have to pay for one yourself. They usually cost £45 to £60.
Medication
In some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed. These are discussed below.
Nebulised medications
Occasionally, medication inhaled through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended to help make it easier for you to clear your lungs.
Nebulisers are devices consisting of a face mask or mouthpiece, a chamber to convert the medication into a fine mist, and a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs.
A number of different medications can be administered using a nebuliser, including salt water solutions. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your phlegm so it’s easier to cough it out. Nebulisers can also be used to administer antibiotics, if necessary (see below).
However, while the medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription, the nebuliser device itself isn’t always available on the NHS. In some areas, a local respiratory service may provide the device without charge, but if this isn’t an option, you may have to pay for a device.
Bronchodilators
If you have a particularly severe flare-up of symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications on a short-term basis.
Bronchodilators are inhaled medications that help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include beta2-adrenergic agonist, anticholinergics and theophylline.
Antibiotics
If you experience a worsening of symptoms because of a bacterial infection (known as an “infective exacerbation”) then you’ll need to be treated with
antibiotics
.
A sample of phlegm will be taken to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection, although you’ll be initially treated with an antibiotic known to be effective against a number of different bacteria (a broad spectrum antibiotic) because it can take a few days to get the test results.
Depending on the test results, you may be prescribed a different antibiotic, or in some cases, a combination of antibiotics known to be effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection.
If you’re well enough to be treated at home, you’ll probably be prescribed two to three antibiotic tablets a day for 10-14 days. It’s important to finish the course even if you feel better, as stopping the course prematurely could cause the infection to recur quickly.
If your symptoms are more severe (see
symptoms of bronchiectasis
for a detailed description) you may need to be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotic injections.
Preventative treatment
If you have three or more infective exacerbations in any one year, or your symptoms during an infective exacerbation were particularly severe, it may be recommended that you take antibiotics on a long-term basis. This can help to prevent further infections and give your lungs the chance to recover.
This could involve taking low-dose antibiotic tablets to minimise the risk of side effects, or using an antibiotic nebuliser (see above for more information about nebulisers).
Using antibiotics in this way does increase the risk that one or more types of bacteria will develop a resistance to the antibiotic. Therefore, you may be asked to give regular phlegm samples to check for any resistance. If bacteria do show signs of developing a resistance, then your antibiotic may need to be changed.
Surgery
Surgery is usually only recommended where bronchiectasis is only affecting a single section of your lung, your symptoms aren’t responding to other treatment and you don’t have an underlying condition that could cause bronchiectasis to recur.
The lungs are made up of sections known as lobes – the left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes. Surgery for focal bronchiectasis would usually involve removing the lobe affected by the bronchiectasis in a type of operation known as a lobectomy.
Surgery won’t be used if more than one lobe is affected, as it’s too dangerous to remove so much lung tissue.
Complications of bronchiectasis
In some cases, people with bronchiectasis can develop serious complications that require emergency treatment.
Coughing up large amounts of blood
A rare, but serious, complication of bronchiectasis is coughing up large amounts of blood (the medical term for this is massive haemoptysis). This can occur when a section of one of the blood vessels supplying the lungs suddenly splits open.
Symptoms that may indicate massive haemoptysis include:
coughing up more than 100ml of blood in a 24-hour period – 100ml is roughly equivalent to a third of a can of drink
breathing difficulties – caused by blood obstructing your airways
feeling lightheaded, dizzy and having cold, clammy skin – caused by rapid blood loss
Massive haemoptysis is a medical emergency. If you think someone is experiencing massive haemoptysis, then phone 999 for an ambulance.
A person with massive haemoptysis needs to be admitted to hospital and a tube may need to be placed into their throat to assist them with their breathing.
A procedure called a bronchial artery embolisation (BAE), carried out by specialist radiology doctors, will then be required to stop the bleeding. During a BAE, a special dye is injected into your arteries so they show up clearly on
X-rays
.
Then, using X-ray scans as a guide, the source of the bleeding is located and injected with tiny particles, around the size of a grain of sand, that will help clog the vessel up and stop the bleeding."

About bronchitis
Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed.
The main symptom is a
cough
, which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause a
sore throat
and wheezing.
Read more about the
symptoms of bronchitis
.
When to see your GP
Most cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and plenty of fluids.
You only need to see your GP if your symptoms are severe or unusual – for example, if:
your cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks
you have a constant fever (a temperature of 38°C – 100.4°F – or above) for more than three days
you cough up mucus streaked with blood
you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as
asthma
or
heart failure
Your GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as
pneumonia
, which has symptoms similar to those of bronchitis. If your GP thinks you may have pneumonia, you will probably need a chest X-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing.
If your GP thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. You will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem.
Treating bronchitis
In most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as “acute bronchitis”. While you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest.
In some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. If symptoms last for at least three months, it is known as “chronic bronchitis”. There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but there are several medications to help relieve symptoms. It is also important to avoid smoking and smoky environments, as this can make your symptoms worse.
Read more about
treating bronchitis
.
Why do I have bronchitis?
The bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles.
The walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation.
Most cases of acute bronchitis develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed, which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing.
Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed.
Read more about the
causes of bronchitis
.
Complications
Pneumonia
is the most common complication of bronchitis. It happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid. 1 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia.
People at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include:
elderly people
people who smoke
people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease
people with a weakened immune system
Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with
antibiotics
at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital.
Read more about the
treatment of pneumonia
.
Who is affected
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits.
Acute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a
cold
, sore throat or
flu
.
It is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the UK affected by chronic bronchitis. Most of these are adults over the age of 50.
Symptoms of bronchitis
The main symptom of bronchitis is a hacking cough. It is likely that your cough will bring up thick yellow-grey mucus (phlegm), although this does not always happen.
Other symptoms of bronchitis are similar to those of other infections, such as the
common cold
or
sinusitis
, and may include:
sore throat
headache
runny or blocked nose
aches and pains
tiredness
If you have bronchitis, your cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore.
Some people may experience shortness of breath or wheezing, due to inflamed airways. However, this is more common with long-term (chronic) bronchitis.
Long-term (chronic) bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis is often known as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
.
The symptoms of COPD can include:
wheezing
increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around
a persistent cough that brings up mucus (phlegm)
frequent
chest infections
The symptoms are often worse in the winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up is when your symptoms are particularly bad.
When to see your GP
See your GP as soon as possible if:
your cough is very severe or lasts longer than three weeks
you have a constant fever (a temperature of 38°C – 100.4°F – or above) for more than three days – this may be a sign of
flu
or a more serious condition, such as
pneumonia
you cough up mucus streaked with blood
you develop rapid breathing (more than 30 breaths a minute) or chest pains
you become drowsy or confused
you have had repeated bouts of bronchitis
You should also contact your GP if you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as:
asthma
heart failure
– weakness in the heart that leads to fluid in your lungs
emphysema – damage to the small airways in your lungs
Causes of bronchitis
The bronchitis infection can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common.
In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the
common cold
or
flu
. The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes.
These droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else.
Everyday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards, may have traces of the virus on them. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets.
Breathing in irritant substances
Bronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke.
Smoking is the main cause of long-term (chronic) bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as smokers themselves.
Read information about
treatments to quit smoking
.
Occupational exposure
You may also be at risk of bronchitis and other forms of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
if you are often exposed to materials that can damage your lungs, such as:
grain dust
textiles (fabric fibres)
ammonia
strong acids
chlorine
This is sometimes referred to as ‘occupational bronchitis’, and usually eases once you are no longer exposed to the irritant substance.
Read more information about the
causes of COPD
.
You can also read the
Health and Safety Executive’s report on COPD in Great Britain attributed to occupational exposure (PDF, 275 KB).
Treating bronchitis
Most cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP, and the symptoms can be easily managed at home.
There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but healthy living will help. In particular, you should
stop smoking
, if you smoke.
Managing symptoms at home
If you have bronchitis:
get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids – this helps prevent
dehydration
and thins the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up
treat headaches, fever, and aches and pains with
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
– although ibuprofen is not recommended if you have
asthma
There is little evidence that cough medicines work –
read more about treating coughs
. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recommended that over-the-counter cough medicines should not be given to children under the age of six.
As an alternative to an over-the-counter cough medicine, try making your own mixture of honey and lemon, which can help soothe a
sore throat
and ease your cough.
Stop smoking
If you smoke, you should stop immediately. Smoking aggravates bronchitis and increases your risk of developing a long-term (chronic) condition.
Stopping smoking
while you have bronchitis can also be the perfect opportunity to quit altogether.
Antibiotics
Although treatment from a GP is rarely necessary, there may be times when you should see one – read more about
when to see your GP
.
Your GP will not routinely prescribe
antibiotics
, as bronchitis is nearly always caused by a virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and prescribing them when they are unnecessary can, over time, make bacteria more resistant to antibiotic treatment.
Your GP will only prescribe antibiotics if you have an increased risk of developing complications, such as
pneumonia
. Antibiotics may be recommended for:
premature babies
elderly people over the age of 80
people with a history of heart, lung, kidney or liver disease
people with a weakened immune system, which could be the result of an underlying condition or a side effect of a treatment such as steroid medication
people with
cystic fibrosis
If you are prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, it is likely to be a five-day course of amoxicillin, oxytetracycline or doxycycline.
Possible side effects of these medicines include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but they are uncommon.
Chronic bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis is treated in the same way as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
For example:
a type of medication called mucolytics can be used to make mucus easier to cough up
an exercise programme known as pulmonary rehabilitation can help you cope better with your symptoms
Stopping smoking is also very important if you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis or COPD.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/bowel-polyps/,"Bowel polyps
Bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. They are common, affecting 15% to 20% of the UK population, and don’t usually cause symptoms.
Polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms:
some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as a sessile polyp
some look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp
some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together
Bowel polyps are not usually cancerous, although if they’re discovered they’ll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.
Some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few. They tend to occur in people over the age of 60.
How are they caused?
Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly.
There may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer.
What are the symptoms?
Most people with polyps won’t be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.
However, some larger polyps can cause:
a small amount of rectal bleeding (blood in your stool)
mucus to be produced when you open your bowels
diarrhoea
or
constipation
abdominal pain
How are they discovered?
Bowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during
screening for bowel cancer
.
If polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps.
How are they treated?
There are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless.
Both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp.
In rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large.
After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if:
the polyp has been completely removed
there is any risk of it regrowing
there is any cancerous change in the polyp
If there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this.
Outlook
Some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but means you’ll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals.
You might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3 to 5 years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/carcinoid-syndrome-and-carcinoid-tumours/,"Carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumours
A carcinoid tumour is a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system – the body system that produces hormones.
The tumour usually grows in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles. It tends to grow very slowly.
Carcinoid syndrome is the collection of symptoms some people get when a carcinoid tumour – usually one that has spread to the liver – releases hormones such as serotonin into the bloodstream.
Signs and symptoms
In the early stages of having a carcinoid tumour, you may not have any symptoms. You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.
If symptoms do develop, they tend to be fairly general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.
Symptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.
Symptoms caused by the tumour
Symptoms will depend on where in the body the tumour develops:
a bowel carcinoid tumour may cause tummy pain, a blocked bowel (
diarrhoea
,
constipation
, feeling or being sick) and bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
a lung carcinoid tumour may cause a
cough
, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing,
breathlessness
,
chest pain
and tiredness
a stomach carcinoid tumour may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness
Some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. For example, an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.
Symptoms caused by the hormones (carcinoid syndrome)
Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:
diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite
flushing of the skin, particularly the face
fast heart rate
breathlessness and wheezing
These symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.
Some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly. There is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.
What causes carcinoid tumours?
It’s not known exactly why carcinoid tumours develop, but it’s thought that most occur by chance.
Your chances of developing a carcinoid tumour may be increased if you have:
a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)
parents or siblings with a carcinoid tumour
parents with
squamous cell skin cancer
,
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
, or cancer of the brain, breast, liver, womb, bladder or kidney
conditions called neurofibromatosis or
tuberous sclerosis
Diagnosing carcinoid tumours
A carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.
Otherwise, people usually speak to their GP after they have developed symptoms. A carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an
endoscopy
.
Treating carcinoid tumours and carcinoid syndrome
If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).
You can read more about the surgery for carcinoid tumours on the Cancer Research UK website.
If the tumour cannot be removed, but it’s not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored.
If it’s causing symptoms, you may be offered one of the following treatments:
injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour
radiotherapy
to kill some of the cancer cells
a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation
a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation
chemotherapy
to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms
Symptoms of carcinoid syndrome can be treated with injections of octreotide and lanreotide. You may also be given medication to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medication.
What can I do to help myself?
There are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.
Generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:
alcohol
large meals
spicy foods
foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats
stress
Some medications, such as
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants
, may make symptoms worse by further increasing your levels of serotonin – but never stop taking medication without seeking medical advice.
If you have diarrhoea, it’s important to keep drinking little and often to avoid
dehydration
.
Outlook
If the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.
Overall, people with carcinoid tumours have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers. Many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.
But as the tumour grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. You may need further surgery or other treatments.
Unfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won’t usually be possible to remove all of it. However, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.
Information about you
If you have carcinoid syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/cerebral-palsy/,"Cerebral palsy
Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by either damage to the brain, or abnormal development of the brain. This damage normally occurs before birth or during a child’s early development. Cerebral palsy is not normally progressive in nature.
Cerebral palsy usually causes abnormal muscle tone and movement. The main types of abnormal muscle tone are:
Spastic cerebral palsy
This is the most common type of abnormal muscle tone. Someone with spastic cerebral palsy is likely to experience a tightening of the muscles throughout the body. This tightening can be persistent or intermittent. The amount of stiffness experienced will vary from person to person.
Dyskinetic cerebral palsy
Individuals with this type of muscle tone may have dystonia or more rarely athetosis.
This describes a type of abnormal muscle control where the muscles can shift from tight to floppy without warning, resulting in involuntary movements.
Ataxic cerebral palsy
This is the least common type of cerebral palsy. It can be identified by shaky movement and poor balance. Someone with ataxic cerebral palsy may struggle with fine motor movements and coordination, like writing or using cutlery. They may have a tremor that increases with activity, and struggle with balance. This can make standing or sitting in an upright position difficult.
Mixed cerebral palsy
Someone with mixed cerebral palsy may have signs of more than one type of abnormal muscle tone at the same time.
Symptoms of cerebral palsy
The symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary from person to person and are dependent on the type of brain injury or abnormality. Someone with cerebral palsy may:
struggle with movement and balance, and may be unable to walk
struggle to speak, and possibly need to use electronic aids
have difficulties with eating, drinking and swallowing
have problems with their vision
experience pain symptoms
experience

A person with cerebral palsy may have secondary symptoms. These are caused by the impact of the condition on their body, rather than directly by cerebral palsy. These can include:
tightness in joints and muscles
dislocations
a change in their physical abilities
changes in the amount of pain they experience
increased
fatigue
Causes of cerebral palsy
Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain during pregnancy, birth or early development.
There are some things that can increase the risk of a child developing cerebral palsy. These include:
premature birth (being born early)
neonatal encephalopathy (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain in pregnancy or around the time of birth)
stroke or bleeding in the baby’s brain during pregnancy or after birth
infection during pregnancy or after birth
meningitis
head injuries
It’s not always possible to tell why a child has developed cerebral palsy.
A child can develop cerebral palsy despite their parents having done everything right during pregnancy and childbirth. The parents of a child with cerebral palsy are not to blame.
Diagnosing cerebral palsy
There isn’t one single test that can diagnose cerebral palsy. Your medical professional will need to see how your child develops over time to make a diagnosis. They may also use tests such as brain scans to confirm the diagnosis.
Coping with waiting for a diagnosis
Waiting for a diagnosis can be very stressful for parents. It’s natural to feel anxious when your child is unwell. NHS inform has advice on dealing with anxiety and stress, and information on where to go to find support for your mental wellbeing.

Most children are diagnosed by two years old. Some children are diagnosed earlier if they’ve spent time in medical settings, for example children who were born premature.
To diagnose cerebral palsy, your medical professional will examine your child’s medical history, and how well they can move, balance, and react. They may also use scans like an
MRI
to see if there’s any sign of damage or abnormal development of the brain.
Living with cerebral palsy
While cerebral palsy is a non-progressive condition (it doesn’t normally get worse over time), it may not stay the same throughout life. Symptoms can change with age, even in adulthood.
Contact your GP if:
you or your child is experiencing a change in condition
you or your child’s symptoms are getting worse
Cerebral palsy doesn’t normally shorten life expectancy. People with cerebral palsy often go on to live long, rich and rewarding lives.
There are resources and treatments available to help both children and adults with cerebral palsy. Everyone with cerebral palsy will have individual needs and these needs may change over time. Your healthcare professional will help you find treatments and resources that work for you or your child.
Physiotherapy
Targeted physiotherapy can help you or your child improve and maintain posture, coordination, strength and balance. Physiotherapists may recommend specialist mobility equipment and advise about the use of orthotic splints.
Occupational therapy
Occupational therapists help people who struggle to complete everyday tasks find new ways of completing them. They can show you or your child how to break down activities into smaller movements, helping build confidence. Occupational therapists also have good knowledge of the medical aids and technologies available to help you or your child.
Speech and language therapy
If you or your child is struggling to talk, a speech and language therapist can help. They have a range of techniques that can help people improve at talking, like helping you or your child learn to shape a sound. Some speech therapists will recommend the use of specialist communication aids.
If you or your child is having issues with swallowing, a speech and language therapist can also help by performing an assessment and making recommendations.
Orthotics
An orthotic device is a piece of equipment that supports a part of the body. This can help improve you or your child’s ability to move and be active.
Orthotics can help with a wide range of the physical problems that can be caused by cerebral palsy. Some will only be used for a short period of time, while others may be used throughout you or your child’s entire life. The need for them can also change with time.
An orthotist will examine you or your child’s ability to move and make recommendations according to you or your child’s personal needs.
Mental health support for those with cerebral palsy
If you have cerebral palsy and need support with your mental health, there are services available through the NHS.

Mental wellbeing support for the parents of children with cerebral palsy
Finding out that your child has cerebral palsy can be very overwhelming for parents. You may feel anxious about the future and isolated from other parents. There are resources available from NHS inform that can help you cope with the emotions you’re feeling. If you’re feeling isolated, an online support group might help you feel less alone.

Medication
Although medication cannot cure cerebral palsy, some types may help ease some of the symptoms, like muscle relaxants for those with spastic or dystonic cerebral palsy. Speak to your healthcare provider for further information about medication.
Surgery
Surgery may be recommended to help with certain symptoms of cerebral palsy. For example, surgery on muscles, bones and nerves can help mobility. Speak to your healthcare provider for further information on surgical options."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/bulimia/,"Bulimia
Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder and mental health condition. People with bulimia are very anxious about their weight and focused on having the ‘right’ body shape. They also spend a lot of time thinking about food.
Symptoms of bulimia
The main symptoms of bulimia are:
bingeing – overeating in a particular pattern
purging – trying to reduce the effect of binging by attempting to get calories out of your body
focus on food – thinking about food all the time, even when you don’t want to
problems with self-esteem
focussing on body image when it comes to food and weight
Diagnosing bulimia
When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your eating habits. For example, they could ask:
how you feel about your weight
if you’re concerned about it
if you make yourself vomit regularly
if you binge-eat
It’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you or ‘catch you out’. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.
Weight and BMI
Your GP may check your weight and calculate your body mass index (BMI).
Blood tests and other tests
Your GP might check your pulse and blood pressure.
Sometimes an
(electrocardiogram (ECG)
may be needed to check how well your heart is working.
Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of:
fluids in your body
chemicals or minerals, like potassium in your blood
Blood tests look for the complications of bulimia. Even if they come back as ‘normal’, your GP may still refer you to a specialist if you’re experiencing bulimia symptoms.
Treating bulimia
Before your treatment begins, you’ll probably have an overall assessment of your health. Your GP or another healthcare professional will do this.
The assessment will help your healthcare professional plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:
your overall health and any medical needs
your social situation, like how much support you have from family and friends
your mood
any risks that affect you, like whether you’re at risk of harming yourself
whether there are any physical risks as a result of bulimia that need urgent treatment
Guided self-help
For many people, guided self-help can be an effective treatment for bulimia. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist).
Activities can include:
worksheets
a food diary
meal plan
writing about difficult thoughts and feelings
Eating disorder service
If guided self help is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service. An eating disorder service will usually offer a structured programme of psychological treatment.
Psychological treatment
The main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. CBT helps to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how you think about food, eating, and weight.
One alternative to CBT is interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT explores the way you interact with other people. It also looks at the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.
Learn more about talking therapies
Medication
Antidepressants like
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
may be used to treat bulimia. They can reduce the urges to binge and vomit.
The medication will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually start on a low dose. The dose will gradually increase as your body adjusts to the medicine.
Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It’s best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.
Relapse
Recovery from bulimia can take a long time. It’s common for bulimia symptoms to return after treatment. This is often called a relapse, and is more likely during times of stress. If relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same. The first step is going to your GP.
Complications of bulimia
There are physical complications associated with bulimia.
These can include:
dental problems – regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay
repeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a
sore throat
due to a lack of nutrients, your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle
your saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder
frequent use of
laxatives
can damage your bowel muscles, causing permanent constipation (finding it difficult to poo)
an increased risk of heart problems
Frequent vomiting or laxative use can cause:
tiredness
weakness
abnormal heart rhythms
kidney damage
convulsions (fits)
muscle spasms
If you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile. While it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.
If you have
diabetes
, you’ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have
type 1 diabetes
.
Getting help for bulimia
People with bulimia can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean making changes to their eating habits.
Helping yourself
If you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:
talking to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family
going to see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support
Helping someone else
If someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
You could speak to your own GP or a healthcare professional if you’d like some advice on how to help someone.
You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders. Your GP or
Scotland’s Service Directory
can help you find services near you.

About cellulitis
Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and the underlying tissue. It can be serious if not treated promptly.
The infection develops suddenly and can spread through the body quickly. Severe infections can spread deep into the body, and can be life threatening.
Most cases are successfully treated with antibiotics at home, although sometimes it needs to be treated in hospital.
Symptoms
of cellulitis
Cellulitis causes an area of skin to suddenly become:
red
hot
swollen
painful
tender
It most often affects the lower legs, but can occur anywhere.
Cellulitis causes swelling, redness, pain and tenderness in the affected area.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
In more severe cases, cellulitis can also be accompanied – and often preceded – by:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
vigorous shaking (rigors)
nausea and vomiting
dizziness
confusion
These are signs that the infection has spread deeper into the body.

Pharmacy First Scotland: Cellulitis treatment from your local pharmacy
Adults 18 years and over with symptoms of cellulitis can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy in certain instances. This includes cases where cellulitis is linked to an insect bites on the arms or body. If the pharmacist cannot treat you they may recommend you see your GP.
Pharmacies
When
to get professional advice
See your pharmacist as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot.
Early treatment can help reduce the risk of the infection becoming severe.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
your face or the area around your eye is affected
your symptoms are getting rapidly worse
you experience other symptoms in addition to the changes in your skin, such as a fever or vomiting
you have a weak immune system – for example, because of
HIV
or
chemotherapy
– or severe
lymphoedema
, a condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues
a young child or elderly person has possible cellulitis
Treatments
for cellulitis
Cellulitis is usually treated with
antibiotics
. Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home.
You’ll usually be given a five-day course of treatment, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days.
Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you’ve been given, even if you’re feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don’t improve within a week.
For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You’ll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip.
Many hospitals can then arrange for this treatment to continue at home or in an outpatient clinic. Treatment is usually for five days.
If the infection responds to treatment quickly, it may be possible to complete the course with antibiotic tablets instead of having injections or a drip.
Read more about
how cellulitis is treated
.
Outlook
for cellulitis
Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery.
But there is a risk it could cause potentially serious problems, particularly if it’s not treated quickly, such as:
blood poisoning (sepsis)
– where the bacteria enter the blood
kidney damage
leg ulcers
Septicaemia and kidney problems can be life threatening and require immediate treatment in hospital.
Causes
of cellulitis
Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection.
The bacteria that cause it often live harmlessly on the skin, but they can lead to an infection if they get into a break in your skin, such as:
a bruise, cut or graze
an
animal bite
or
insect bite
a leg ulcer
dry, cracked skin – for example, because of
eczema
or
athlete’s foot
In most cases the trigger for the infection is unknown.
The infection isn’t normally spread from person to person.
Read about the
causes of cellulitis
, including information on who’s most at risk of the condition.
Preventing
cellulitis
If you’ve had cellulitis before, you’re more likely to get it again.
It’s not always possible to prevent it, but the following measures may help reduce your risk:
use moisturiser if your skin is dry or prone to cracking
lose weight
if you’re overweight – being
obese
can increase your risk of cellulitis
try to ensure any conditions that can increase your risk of cellulitis – such as eczema, athlete’s foot, leg ulcers and lymphoedema – are well managed
make sure any cuts, grazes or bites are kept clean – wash them under running tap water and cover them with a plaster or dressing
wash your hands regularly – particularly when treating or touching a wound or skin condition
If you get cellulitis often or severely, your GP may refer you to a skin specialist called a dermatologist, or an infection specialist, to discuss the option of taking antibiotics on a long-term basis to protect against further infections.
Symptoms of cellulitis
Symptoms of cellulitis develop suddenly and can get worse quickly. It affects the skin and can also cause additional symptoms.
Skin symptoms
Cellulitis causes the affected skin to become:
red
hot
swollen
painful
tender
There may also be a break in the skin, although this isn’t always obvious, and pus or blood-filled
blisters
.
Any part of the body can be affected.
Commonly affected areas include the lower legs, feet, arms or hands, and sometimes the face, particularly around the eyes.
See your GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot.
The symptoms of cellulitis include redness, swelling and tenderness.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Additional symptoms
Cellulitis can also cause additional symptoms that may develop before or alongside the changes to your skin.
These can include:
feeling generally unwell
feeling sick
shivering
chills
Occasionally the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the deeper layers of tissue, blood, muscle and bone. This can be very serious and potentially life threatening.
Signs the infection has spread include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a fast heartbeat or fast breathing
being sick
diarrhoea
feeling
dizzy
or faint
confusion or disorientation
cold, clammy, pale skin
unresponsiveness or loss of consciousness
Call 999 or go to
your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department
immediately if you have other symptoms in addition to changes to your skin.
Causes of cellulitis
Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. It occurs when bacteria get into the tissues beneath the skin.
How the infection occurs
The bacteria that cause cellulitis often live harmlessly on the skin. But if the surface of your skin is damaged, they can get into the layers underneath and cause an infection.
The break in the skin may be so small it’s not noticeable.
It may be caused by:
a
cut or graze
a
burn
an
animal or human bite
an
insect bite
a puncture wound
a
leg ulcer
the skin becoming dry and cracked – for example, because of
eczema
or
athlete’s foot
Cellulitis isn’t normally spread from person to person as the infection occurs deep within the skin and is often caused by bacteria that live on the skin’s surface without causing problems.
Increased risk
Anyone can get cellulitis, but you’re at an increased risk if:
you’re
obese
you have poor circulation in your arms, legs, hands or feet
you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of
HIV
or
chemotherapy
treatment
you have
lymphoedema
– a condition that causes fluid to build up under your skin
you have poorly controlled
diabetes
you’ve had cellulitis before
you use injected drugs
Ensuring the underlying health conditions mentioned above are well controlled may help reduce your risk of getting cellulitis.
Treating cellulitis
Cellulitis can often be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.
Treatment at home
Antibiotics
If you’re treated at home, you’ll usually be prescribed
antibiotic
tablets to take two to four times a day for a week.
A longer course may be needed if your symptoms don’t improve after a week or you have an underlying condition that makes cellulitis more difficult to treat, such as
lymphoedema
.
Commonly prescribed antibiotics include flucloxacillin and clarithromycin. Possible side effects can include an upset stomach or
diarrhoea
.
Your symptoms may get worse in the first 48 hours after treatment starts, but should start to improve soon afterwards.
Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you’re given, even if you’re feeling better.
Looking after yourself
While you’re recovering at home, the following steps can help ease your symptoms and aid your recovery:
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
for the pain
raise the affected body part to reduce swelling – for example, if your leg is affected, rest it on pillows or a chair when you’re sitting or lying down
try to regularly move the joint near the affected body part, such as your wrist or ankle, to stop it getting stiff
drink plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
if you usually wear compression stockings – for example, for lymphoedema – avoid these until you’ve recovered
When to get medical advice
Contact your GP as soon as possible if:
your symptoms get worse after 48 hours
your symptoms haven’t improved after a week
you develop additional symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) or vomiting
Treatment in hospital
If you need to be admitted to hospital for treatment, you’ll be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip (intravenous antibiotics).
Once you’ve recovered from the initial symptoms, you can usually be treated with antibiotic injections or tablets at home or as an outpatient, rather than staying in hospital."

About breast cancer in men
Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.
It’s much less common in men than women.
The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.
However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called
gynaecomastia
. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.
Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.
Read more about the
symptoms of male breast cancer
When to speak to your GP
You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.
While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.
Why it happens
The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include:
age – most cases affect men over the age of 60
having a family history of breast cancer (male or female)
obesity
– a
body mass index (BMI)
of 30 or more
Read more about
causes of breast cancer in men
Treating breast cancer in men
In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen.
Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning.
In some cases,
radiotherapy
or
chemotherapy
may be used for the same purpose.
Read more about
treating breast cancer in men
Outlook
The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there’s reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.
The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it’s diagnosed.
Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.
Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread.

Reducing your risk
The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to:
drink alcohol in moderation
maintain a healthy weight

healthy diet
and exercising regularly

Symptoms of breast cancer in men
The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.
The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).
However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called
gynaecomastia
. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.
Less common symptoms of male breast cancer include:
the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)
the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)
fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)
Advanced symptoms
Additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.
Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:
bone pain
swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit
shortness of breath
feeling unusually tired all the time
feeling sick (nausea)
itchy skin with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
When to seek medical advice
You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.
These problems are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they should be investigated further.
Causes of breast cancer in men
It’s not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
Age
Like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It’s rare for young men to develop the condition.
Genetics and family history
A genetic mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. The result is that one or more of the body’s processes may not work in the way they should.
There are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation.
There’s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer, such as a mother or sister.
Routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn’t usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However, some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around £2,000 to £3,000.
Oestrogen
There’s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.
Compared with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include:
hormone treatments – man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients undergoing a male to female sex change
obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal
cirrhosis
– this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term
alcohol misuse
There is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called
Klinefelter syndrome
. This is a congenital condition that boys are born with that means those who are affected produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual.
As testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.
Occupational risks
There’s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments.
Environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include:
blast furnaces
steelworks
rolling mills – a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers
car manufacturing plants
One hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels.
Another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men.
Rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large.
The reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn’t yet been proven.
Radiation
Exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.
Research has found men who received a course of
radiotherapy
– where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells – directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared with the population at large.
However, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.
Diagnosing breast cancer in men
If you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you.
During the examination, they’ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).
It’s likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there’s a possibility you may have breast cancer.
Mammogram
A mammogram is a type of
X-ray
used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.
During the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn’t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.
Once your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.
Ultrasound
An
ultrasound scan
uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.
An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.
Biopsy
A
biopsy
may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.
A biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.
A type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. This type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area.
During a core biopsy, a
local anaesthetic
will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump.
If cancer is found, it’s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells.
This is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found – and they are in more than half of cases – it’s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy.
Read

Staging
After breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. Staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis.
A cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. However, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it’s diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage.
In some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they’re contained within the breast ducts and can’t spread.
If left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.
Coping with a diagnosis
Being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.
Most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.
Feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there’s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared with the support available for women with the condition.
Sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be
depressed
if you’ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy during the past month.
If you think you may be depressed, visit your GP. There is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression.
You may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition.

online forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer
. Cancer Research UK also provides

Screening for breast cancer in men
As breast cancer is rare in men, routine screening for the condition isn’t recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had
radiotherapy

Treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.
Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask the specialist. For example, you could ask about the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Your treatment plan
Your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn’t spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.
In these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by
radiotherapy
, hormone therapy, or
chemotherapy
to help prevent the cancer returning.
If the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won’t be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.
More information about these treatments can be found below.
Surgery
An operation called a
mastectomy
is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.
A mastectomy involves removing the entire breast, sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.
In some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there’s a risk the cancer has spread to this area.
Once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.
After surgery
Most men are well enough to leave hospital 1 to 3 days after surgery.
After the operation, it’s likely you’ll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you’re well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this.
The wound takes about 2 to 3 weeks to heal. It’s important to keep the wound clean during this time.
You should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection.
It’s difficult to predict when you’ll feel able to return to work. Some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed.
Others prefer to return to work in between treatments. Your MDT will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours.
It can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended.
Your treatment team will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise).
Complications of surgery
After surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is caused by nerve damage during surgery.
The numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent.
Another possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called
lymphoedema
, which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue).
If many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system’s ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling.
There’s no cure for lymphoedema, but it’s possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments.
See
treating lymphoedema
for more information
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.
A typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes.
Radiotherapy isn’t usually painful, although you’ll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells.
Common side effects of radiotherapy can include:
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
feeling sick (nausea)
sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to
sunburn
The side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months.
Radiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. This is known as palliative radiotherapy.
Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn’t usually cause any side effects.
Hormone therapy
Up to 90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. ‘E’ is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is ‘estrogen’.
This means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women.
The aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen is one of the hormone-blocking medications widely used for breast cancer. It’s available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.
The ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. Studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. However, it’s unclear if this also applies to men.
Tamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your treatment team is deciding which treatments to recommend. You can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors.
Side effects of tamoxifen can include:
reduced interest in sex
(loss of libido)
inability to obtain or maintain an erection
(erectile dysfunction)
headache
feeling sick – taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect
changes in mood, such as feeling irritable or
depressed
You should inform your team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available.
Aromatase inhibitors
Aromatase inhibitors are an alternative type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer.
In men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body.
Aromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there’s little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer.
Side effects of aromatase inhibitors can include:
joint pain
lack of energy
hot flushes
skin rashes
feeling sick
being sick
thinning of the hair
However, it’s unlikely you’ll experience any or all of these side effects.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+).
It’s usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it’s used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.
Chemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. Treatment is usually given every 2 to 3  weeks over the course of 6 months.
You may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both.
The side effects of chemotherapy can include:
feeling sick
being sick
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
mouth ulcers
tiredness
skin rashes
infertility
hair loss
The side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished. Your hair should grow back about 3 to 6 months after treatment.
Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It’s important to tell your MDT about any symptoms of a potential infection, such as:
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain
a general sense of feeling unwell
You should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.
If you’re sexually active, you should use a
condom
for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner’s genitals.
You should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended
Depending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.
Biological therapy
Biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer.
Biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce.
If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning.
Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab
is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein.
Trastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). You’ll receive the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages.
On average, for early breast cancer you’ll need to have a session once every 3 weeks, and for more advanced cancer you’ll need to have weekly sessions.
Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as
angina
, uncontrolled
high blood pressure
(hypertension), or heart valve disease.
If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it’s not causing any problems.
Other side effects of trastuzumab can include:
an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever
diarrhoea
tiredness
aches and pains"

Chlamydia is a bacterial infection. It’s one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the UK.
Symptoms of chlamydia
Most people with chlamydia don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do get symptoms, it’s usually 1 to 3 weeks after having unprotected sex. Some people don’t get symptoms until months later.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:
pain when peeing
unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus
pain in the lower tummy, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periods
pain in the testicles
red, sticky eyes
Sometimes symptoms can disappear after a few days. Even if symptoms go away you may still have the infection and could pass it on.
Testing for chlamydia
If you think you might have chlamydia, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
(if you have symptoms)
contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)
ordering a home test kit
(if you do not have symptoms)
Services available may vary depending on where you live.
What does a chlamydia test involve?
The test for chlamydia is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.
You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:
using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed
People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.
Treatment for chlamydia
Antibiotics will treat the chlamydia infection.
You should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) have been treated. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.
If chlamydia is left untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
If chlamydia is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
. This is a major cause of
ectopic pregnancy
and infertility in women.
If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.
How chlamydia is passed on
You can get chlamydia by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Other ways of getting chlamydia include:
sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye
Chlamydia can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth.
Any sexually active person can get chlamydia. It’s most common in people under the age of 30.
You can have had chlamydia for a while without knowing.
How to prevent chlamydia
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with chlamydia you should get tested for all STIs including:
gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/chest-infection/,"Chest infection
Chest infections are common, especially after a
cold
or
flu
during autumn and winter.
Although most are mild and get better on their own, some can be serious or even life-threatening.
Signs and symptoms of a chest infection
The main symptoms of a chest infection can include:
a persistent
cough
coughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood
breathlessness
or rapid and shallow breathing
wheezing
a high temperature (fever)
a rapid heartbeat
chest pain or tightness
feeling confused and disorientated
You may also experience more general symptoms of an infection, such as a
headache
, fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, or joint and muscle pain.
What causes chest infections?
A chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are
bronchitis
and
pneumonia
.
Most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria.
These infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others.
The infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose.
Certain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as:
babies and very young children
children with developmental problems
people who are very overweight
elderly people
pregnant women
people who smoke
people with long-term health conditions, such as
asthma
,
heart disease
,
diabetes
,
kidney disease
,
cystic fibrosis
or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
people with a weakened immune system – this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids,
chemotherapy
or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed
HIV
infection

causes of bronchitis
and the
causes of pneumonia
Caring for your symptoms at home
Many chest infections aren’t serious and get better within a few days or weeks. You won’t usually need to see your GP, unless your symptoms suggest you have a more serious infection.
While you recover at home, there are things you can do to improve your symptoms.
Do
get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluid to prevent dehydration and to loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up
treat headaches, fever and aches and pains with pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
drink a warm drink of honey and lemon to relieve a sore throat caused by persistent coughing
raise your head up with extra pillows while you’re sleeping to make breathing easier
stop smoking if you smoke
Avoid cough medicines, as there’s little evidence they work. Coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs.
Antibiotics
aren’t recommended for many chest infections, because they only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus.
Your GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you’re at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs (
pleurisy
).
If there’s a flu outbreak in your local area and you’re at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication.
Read more about
treating bronchitis
and
treating pneumonia
When to contact your GP practice
Contact your GP practice if:
you feel very unwell or your symptoms are severe
your symptoms are not improving
you feel confused, disorientated or drowsy
you have chest pain or difficulty breathing
you cough up blood or blood-stained phlegm
your skin or lips develop a blue tinge (cyanosis)
you’re pregnant
you’re 65 or over
you’re very overweight and have difficulty breathing
you think a child under five has a chest infection
you have a weakened immune system
you have a long-term health condition
you have a cough that has lasted more than 3 weeks
Your GP should be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms and by listening to your chest using a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).
In some cases, further tests – such as a chest
X-ray
, breathing tests and testing phlegm or
blood samples
– may be needed.
Preventing chest infections
There are measures you can take to help reduce your risk of developing chest infections and stop them spreading to others.
Stop smoking
If you smoke, one of the best things you can do to prevent a chest infection is to stop. Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection.
Read more information and advice about
stopping smoking
Good hygiene
Although chest infections generally aren’t as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing.
Therefore, it’s important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash your hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately.
Alcohol and diet
Excessive and prolonged
alcohol misuse
can weaken your lungs’ natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections.
To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends:
not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week
if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it’s best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days
if you’re trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it’s a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week
Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.
Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections.
Read more about
healthy eating
and
tips on cutting down on alcohol
Vaccinations
If you’re at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia).
These vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future.
Flu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for:
babies and young children
pregnant women (flu jab only)
people aged 65 and over
people with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems"

About cervical cancer
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman’s cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina).
Cancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you do have symptoms, the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between
periods
or after the
menopause
.
Abnormal bleeding doesn’t mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within 2 weeks.
Read more about the
symptoms of cervical cancer
and
diagnosing cervical cancer
Screening for cervical cancer
Cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years. You may be recalled more often depending on your test results.
Those on non-routine screening (where screening results have shown changes that need further investigation or follow up) will be invited up to 70 years of age.
If you have unusual discharge, or bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause, contact your GP practice. These symptoms are not usually caused by cancer but it’s important to have them checked.
You will be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment.
Read more about cervical screening
What causes cervical cancer?
Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the
human papilloma virus (HPV)
. HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman.
There are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.
Two strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18) are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. These types of HPV infection don’t have any symptoms, so many women won’t realise they have the infection.
However, it’s important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who have them don’t develop cervical cancer.
Using
condoms
during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can’t always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area.
Since 2008, a
HPV vaccine
has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13.

causes of cervical cancer
and

Treating cervical cancer
If cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it’s usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it’s possible to leave the womb in place, but it may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is called a
hysterectomy
.
Radiotherapy
is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it’s used alongside surgery.
More advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
.
Some of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including
early menopause
and
infertility
.
Read more about
treating cervical cancer
Complications
Many women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery.
Complications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure.
Read more about the
complications of cervical cancer
Outlook
The stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining outlook. The staging, given as a number from 1 to 4, indicates how far the cancer has spread.
The chances of living for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are:
stage 1 – 80-99%
stage 2 – 60-90%
stage 3 – 30-50%
stage 4 – 20%
Read more about the
staging of cervical cancer
Who’s affected by cervical cancer?
Following the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.
It’s possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.
Symptoms of cervical cancer
The symptoms of cervical cancer aren’t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it’s reached an advanced stage.
This is why it’s very important that you attend all of your
cervical screening
appointments.
Unusual bleeding
In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex.
Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly
period
is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the
menopause
(when a woman’s monthly periods stop).
Visit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.
Other symptoms
Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.
Advanced cervical cancer
If the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:
constipation
blood in your urine (haematuria)
loss of bladder control (
urinary incontinence
)
bone pain
swelling of one of your legs
severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a condition called hydronephrosis
changes to your bladder and bowel habits
loss of appetite
weight loss
tiredness and a lack of energy
When to seek medical advice
You should contact your GP if you experience:
bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding)
bleeding outside of your normal periods
new bleeding after the menopause
Vaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. However, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your GP.
Causes of cervical cancer
In almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell DNA caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).
Cancer begins with a change in the structure of the DNA that’s present in all human cells. DNA provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce.
A change in the DNA’s structure is known as a mutation. It can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. If the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour.
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
More than 99% of cervical cancer cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types.
HPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an HPV infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5 women will develop the infection at some point in their lives.
Some types of HPV don’t cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. Other types of HPV can cause
genital warts
, although these types aren’t linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer.
About 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The 2 types known to have the highest risk are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers.
High-risk types of HPV are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. This material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour.
As most types of HPV don’t cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it.
See
preventing cervical cancer
for more information about reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection.
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
Cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN).
CIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions don’t pose an immediate threat to a person’s health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future.
However, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during
cervical screening
, treatment is highly successful.
The progression from becoming infected with HPV to developing CIN or CGIN and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often taking 10 to 20 years.
Read more about
cervical screening results
Increased risk
The fact that HPV infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. There appear to be additional risk factors that affect a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer. These include:
smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer than women who don’t; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix
having a weakened immune system – this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as
HIV or AIDS
taking the
oral contraceptive pill
for more than 5 years – women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don’t, although it’s not clear why
having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) – women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared with women who don’t have any children
The reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of HPV.
The spread of cervical cancer
If cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix and into the surrounding tissue and organs. The cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. Alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters).
The cancer can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. Cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system.
The lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). If you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen.
In some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.
Diagnosing cervical cancer
If cervical cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system).
Referral will be recommended if the results of your
cervical screening test
suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. However, in most cases, the abnormalities don’t mean you have cervical cancer.
You may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, or if your GP has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination.
The sexually transmitted infection (STI)
chlamydia
is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. Your GP may recommend that you’re tested for it first before being referred.
Testing for chlamydia
involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test.
Colposcopy
If you’ve had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out a
colposcopy
. This is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix.
During a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. As well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample (
biopsy
) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.
Cone biopsy
In some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. The operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a
local anaesthetic
.
During a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. You may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. You may also have period-like pains.
Further testing
If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there’s a risk that the cancer may have spread, you’ll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. These tests may include:
a pelvic examination carried out under
general anaesthetic
– your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer
blood tests
– these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the CT scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread
chest
X-ray
– this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs
positive emission tomography (PET) scan
– a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it’s often combined with a CT scan and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatment
Staging
After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. The higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. The staging for cervical cancer is as follows:
stage 0 (pre-cancer) – there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS)
stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the cervix
stage 2 – the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn’t reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina
stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall
stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as the lungs
Treating cervical cancer
Treatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread.
As cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual.
MDTs are made up of a number of different specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Your cancer team will recommend what they think the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. In most cases, the recommendations will be:
early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb,
radiotherapy
, or a combination
advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy
, although surgery is also sometimes used
The prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread.
In cases where cervical cancer isn’t curable, it’s often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. This is known as
palliative care
.
Removing abnormal cells
If your screening results show that you don’t have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. These include:
large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) – the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current
cone biopsy – the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery
laser therapy – a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells

treating abnormal cells in the cervix
Surgery
There are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. They are:
radical trachelectomy – the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place
hysterectomy – the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes
pelvic exenteration – a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed
Radical trachelectomy
A radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a very early stage. It’s usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential.
During the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts) in your abdomen. Specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. Lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. Your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina.
Compared with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration, the advantage of this type of surgery is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may still be able to have children. However, it’s important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can’t guarantee you’ll still be able to have children.
If you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by caesarean section. It’s also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal.
Radical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. It’s only available at a number of specialist centres in the UK, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated.
Hysterectomy
A
hysterectomy
is usually recommended for early cervical cancer. This may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back.
There are 2 types of hysterectomies used to treat cervical cancer:
simple hysterectomy – where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers
radical hysterectomy – where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage 1 and some early stage 2 cervical cancers
Short-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder or rectum.
The risk of long-term complications is small, but they can be troublesome. They include:
the risk that your vagina can become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful
urinary incontinence
swelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid (
lymphoedema
)
your bowel becomes obstructed because of a build-up of scar tissue – this may require further surgery to correct
As your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you’ll no longer be able to have children.
If your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger the
menopause
if you haven’t already experienced it. See
complications of cervical cancer
for more information about the menopause.
Pelvic exenteration
A pelvic exenteration is a major operation that’s usually only recommended when cervical cancer returns after what was thought to be a previously successful course of treatment. It’s offered if the cancer returns to the pelvis, but hasn’t spread beyond this area.
A pelvic exenteration involves two phases of treatment:
the cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel
2 holes called stomas are created in your abdomen – the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bags
Following a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. This means you’ll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
may be used on its own or combined with surgery for early-stage cervical cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain.
There are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. These are:
externally – a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells
internally – a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix
In most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. A course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks.
As well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue. This means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment.
However, the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. For some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer.
Side effects of radiotherapy
are common and can include:
diarrhoea
pain when urinating
bleeding from your vagina or rectum
feeling very tired (fatigue)
feeling sick (nausea)
sore skin in your pelvis region similar to sunburn
narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful
infertility
damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven’t already experienced it)
bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence
Most of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. It’s also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years after treatment has finished.
If infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. However, you may have to pay for this.
It may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. This is known as an ovarian transposition.
Your MDT can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you’re suitable for an ovarian transposition.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
can be combined with radiotherapy to try to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).
Chemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the cancerous cells.
Chemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you’ll be able to go home once you’ve received your dose.
As with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. Side effects are therefore common and can include:
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
feeling tired all the time
reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells
mouth ulcers
loss of appetite
hair loss
– your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss
Some types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular
blood tests
to assess the health of your kidneys.
Follow-up
After your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you’ll need to attend regular appointments for testing. This will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn’t been removed).
As there’s a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. If anything suspicious is found, a further biopsy can be carried out.
If cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed.
Follow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for a further 3 years.
Complications of cervical cancer
Complications of cervical cancer can occur as a side effect of treatment or as the result of advanced cervical cancer.
Side effects
Early menopause
If your ovaries are surgically removed or they’re damaged during treatment with
radiotherapy
, it will trigger an
early menopause
(if you haven’t already had it). Most women experience the menopause in their early fifties.
The menopause is caused when your ovaries stop producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. This leads to the following symptoms:
you no longer have monthly periods or your periods become much more irregular
hot flushes
vaginal dryness
loss of sex drive
mood changes
stress incontinence
(leaking urine when you cough or sneeze)
night sweats
thinning of the bones, which can lead to brittle bones (
osteoporosis
)
These symptoms can be relieved by taking a number of medications that stimulate the production of oestrogen and progesterone. This treatment is known as
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
.
Narrowing of the vagina
Radiotherapy to treat cervical cancer can often cause your vagina to become narrower, which can make having sex painful or difficult.
There are 2 main treatment options if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to your vagina. This should increase moisture within your vagina and make having sex easier.
The second is to use a vaginal dilator, which is a tampon-shaped device made of plastic. You insert it into your vagina and is designed to help make it more supple. It’s usually recommended that you insert the dilator for 5 to 10 minutes at a time on a regular basis during the day over the course of 6 to 12 months.
Many women find discussing the use of a vaginal dilator embarrassing, but it’s a standard and well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse or radiographers in the radiotherapy department should be able to give you more information and advice.
You may find that the more times you have sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.
The
Macmillan Cancer Support
website has more information about
sexuality and cancer
Lymphoedema
If the lymph nodes in your pelvis are removed, it can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of your lymphatic system.
One of the functions of the lymphatic system is to drain away excess fluid from the body’s tissue. A disruption to this process can lead to a build-up of fluid in the tissue known as
lymphoedema
. This can cause certain body parts to become swollen – usually the legs, in cases of cervical cancer.
There are exercises and massage techniques that can reduce the swelling. Wearing specially designed bandages and compression garments can also help.
Read more about
treating lymphoedema
Emotional impact
The emotional impact of living with cervical cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a ‘rollercoaster’ effect.
For example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel better when removal of the cancer has been confirmed. You may then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.
This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger
depression
. Typical signs of depression include feeling sad, hopeless and losing interest in things you used to enjoy.
Contact your GP if you think you may be depressed. There is a range of effective treatments available, including
antidepressant medication
and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
You may also find
Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust
a useful resource. It’s the UK’s only charity dedicated to women affected by cervical cancer.
Local cancer support groups may also be available in your area for women affected by cancer. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide contact details.
Read more about feelings and cancer
Advanced cervical cancer
Some of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below.
Pain
If the cancer spreads into your nerve endings, bones or muscles, it can often cause severe pain.
A number of effective painkilling medications can usually be used to control the pain. Depending on the levels of pain, they can range from
paracetamol
and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
such as
ibuprofen
, to more powerful opiate-based painkillers, such as codeine and morphine.
Tell your care team if the painkillers you’re prescribed aren’t effective in reducing your pain. You may need to be prescribed a stronger medication. A short course of radiotherapy may also be effective in controlling the pain.
Macmillan nurses
, who work both in hospitals and in the community, can also provide expert advice about pain relief.
Kidney failure
Your kidneys remove waste material from your blood. The waste is passed out of your body in urine through tubes called the ureters. Kidney function can be monitored by a simple blood test called serum creatinine level.
In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, the cancerous tumour can press against the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. The build-up of urine inside the kidneys is known as hydronephrosis and can cause the kidneys to become swollen and stretched.
Severe cases of hydronephrosis can cause the kidneys to become scarred, which can lead to the loss of most or all of the kidneys’ functions. This is known as kidney failure.
Kidney failure can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:
tiredness
swollen ankles, feet or hands, caused by water retention
shortness of breath
feeling sick
blood in your urine (haematuria)
Treatment options for kidney failure associated with cervical cancer include draining urine out of the kidneys using a tube inserted through the skin and into each kidney (percutaneous nephrostomy). Another option is to widen the ureters by placing a small metal tube called a stent inside them.
Blood clots
As with other types of cancer, cervical cancer can make the blood ‘stickier’ and more prone to forming clots. Bed rest after surgery and
chemotherapy
can also increase the risk of developing a clot.
Large tumours can press on the veins in the pelvis, which slows the flow of blood and can lead to a blood clot developing in the legs.
Symptoms of a blood clot in your legs include:
pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf)
a heavy ache in the affected area
warm skin in the area of the clot
redness of the skin, particularly at the back of your leg, below the knee
A major concern in these cases is that the blood clot from the leg vein will travel up to the lungs and block the supply of blood. This is known as a pulmonary embolism and can be fatal.
Blood clots in the legs are usually treated using a combination of blood-thinning medication, such as heparin or
warfarin
, and compression garments designed to help encourage the flow of blood through the limbs.
Read more about
treating deep vein thrombosis
Bleeding
If the cancer spreads into your vagina, bowel or bladder, it can cause significant damage, resulting in bleeding. Bleeding can occur in your vagina or rectum (back passage), or you may pass blood when you urinate.
Minor bleeding can often be treated using a medication called tranexamic acid, which encourages the blood to clot and stop the bleeding. Radiotherapy can also be highly effective in controlling bleeding caused by cancer.
Major bleeding may be treated temporarily by vaginal packing (using gauze to stem the bleeding) and later by surgery, radiotherapy or by cutting off blood supply to the cervix.
Fistula
A fistula is an uncommon but distressing complication that occurs in around 1 in 50 cases of advanced cervical cancer.
A fistula is an abnormal channel that develops between 2 sections of the body. In most cases involving cervical cancer, the fistula develops between the bladder and the vagina. This can lead to a persistent discharge of fluid from the vagina. A fistula can sometimes develop between the vagina and rectum.
Surgery is usually required to repair a fistula, although it’s often not possible in women with advanced cervical cancer, because they’re usually too frail to withstand the effects of surgery.
In such cases, treatment often involves using medication, creams and lotions to reduce the amount of discharge and protect the vagina and surrounding tissue from damage and irritation.
Vaginal discharge
Another uncommon, but distressing, complication of advanced cervical cancer is an unpleasant-smelling discharge from your vagina.
The discharge can occur for a number of reasons, such as the breakdown of tissue, the leakage of bladder or bowel contents out of the vagina, or a bacterial infection of the vagina.
Treatment options for vaginal discharge include an antibacterial gel called metronidazole and wearing clothing that contains charcoal. Charcoal is a chemical compound that’s very effective in absorbing unpleasant smells.
Palliative care
If your doctors can’t do any more to treat your cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. This is called
palliative care
.
Palliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.
There are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. You may want to think about whether you’d like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and discuss these issues with your doctor. Some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include:
Macmillan Cancer Support
– which has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. To be referred to a Macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or GP, or call 0808 808 00 00.
Marie Curie Cancer Care
– have specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. They also run hospices for people with cancer.
Hospice UK
– provides information about hospice care and how to find a hospice.
Living with cervical cancer
The impact of cervical cancer on your daily life will depend on the stage of cancer and the treatment you’re having.
Many women with cervical cancer have a radical
hysterectomy
. This is a major operation that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. During this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as lifting children or heavy shopping bags.
You won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. Most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy.
Some of the treatments for cervical cancer can make you very tired, particularly
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
. Because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while.
Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact.
Work
Having cervical cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, although you may need quite a lot of time off. During treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before.
If you have cancer, you’re covered by the
Disability Discrimination Act
. This means that your employer isn’t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. Examples of these include:
allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments
allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment
The definition of what’s ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer’s business, for example.
You should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you’ll need off and when. Speak to a member of your human resources department, if you have one. Your union or staff association representative can also give you advice.
If you’re having difficulties with your employer, your union or local
Citizens Advice Bureau
may be able to help.
Macmillan Cancer Support
also has more information and advice about
work and cancer
.
Money and benefits
If you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:
if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer
if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income
It’s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.
Your sex life
Many women feel nervous about having sex soon after treatment for cervical cancer, but it’s perfectly safe. Sex won’t make the cancer come back and your partner can’t catch cancer from you.
If you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. This will give your body time to heal.
If you’re having chemotherapy, male partners should wear a
condom
when you have sex, because it’s not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them.
Some women find sex difficult after being treated for cervical cancer, because the side effects of some treatments can include vaginal dryness and narrowing of the vagina. In these cases, there are treatments that can help, such as vaginal dilators.
See
complications of cervical cancer
for more information
Preventing cervical cancer
There’s no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk.
Safer sex
Most cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of
human papillomavirus (HPV)
. HPV can be spread through unprotected sex, so using a
condom
can reduce your risk of developing the infection. However, the virus isn’t just passed on through penetrative sex – it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys.
Your risk of developing an HPV infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it.
Read more about
sexual health
Cervical screening
Regular
cervical screening
is the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage.
Cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland between the ages of 25 and 64 every 5 years.
You may be recalled more often depending on your test results.
Make sure that your GP surgery has your up-to-date contact details, so that you continue getting screening invitations.
It’s important that you attend your cervical screening tests, even if you’ve been vaccinated for HPV, because the vaccine doesn’t guarantee protection against cervical cancer.
If you’ve been treated for abnormal cervical cell changes, you’ll be invited for screening more frequently for several years after treatment. How regularly you need to go will depend on how severe the cell change is.
Although it can identify most abnormal cell changes in the cervix, cervical screening isn’t always 100% accurate. Therefore, you should report symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding to your GP, even if you’ve recently been tested.
Cervical cancer vaccination
The NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called Gardasil. Gardasil protects against four types of HPV, including the 2 strains responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK (HPV16 and HPV 18). It also prevents
genital warts
.
Girls are offered the
childhood immunisation programme
. The vaccine is given to girls when they’re 12 to 13 years old, with 3 doses given over a 6-month period.
Although the
HPV vaccine
can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it doesn’t guarantee that you won’t develop the condition. You should still attend cervical screening tests, even if you’ve had the vaccine.
Avoid smoking
You can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. People who smoke are less able to get rid of the HPV infection from the body, which can develop into cancer.
If you decide to give up smoking, you could contact the
Quit Your Way Scotland
on 0800 84 84 84. Quit Your Way Scotland is run by NHS 24 and is staffed by trained advisors who’ll be able to give you expert advice.
If you want to give up smoking, but you don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms that you may experience after giving up.

About catarrh
About catarrh
Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body.
It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face).
It’s often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh.
Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it’s not harmful and there are treatments available.
Symptoms associated with catarrh
Catarrh can lead to a:
constant need to clear your throat
feeling that your throat is blocked
blocked or stuffy nose that you can’t clear
runny nose
feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat
persistent
cough
headache
or facial pain
reduced sense of smell and taste
crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss
These problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired.
Treatments for catarrh
Catarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves.
There are things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms, such as:
avoiding things that trigger your symptoms, such as allergens or smoky places
taking sips of cold water when you feel the need to clear your throat – constantly clearing your throat may make things worse
using a saline nasal rinse several times a day – these can be bought from a pharmacy or made at home with half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of boiled water that’s been left to cool
avoiding warm, dry atmospheres, such as places with air conditioning and car heating systems – placing plants or bowls of water in a room may help to keep the air humid
staying well hydrated
talking to a pharmacist about suitable over-the-counter medications – including
decongestants
, antihistamines or
steroid
nasal sprays
There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there’s generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work.
When to see your GP
Speak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with.
They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or
allergies
. This may mean you need to be referred to a specialist for tests.
If you’re diagnosed with a specific underlying condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.
If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended. Unfortunately, however, chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time.
What causes catarrh?
Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.
This can be triggered by:
a
cold
or other infections
hay fever
or other types of
allergic rhinitis
non-allergic rhinitis
nasal polyps
It’s unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it’s not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection.
It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose or an increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat."

This information is useful for those who have been diagnosed with bunions. People experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact a healthcare professional for assessment and diagnosis.
Read more about self-managing a foot problem
A bunion (hallux valgus) is a deformity caused by the base joint of the big toe developing sideways. This pushes the bones of the big toe towards the smaller toes.
If you have a bunion, try to stay positive. There’s a lot you can do to help yourself.
What causes a bunion?
The exact cause of bunions is unknown. Contributing factors can be:
a joint problem like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis
poorly fitting footwear
a family history
Bunion symptoms
Bunions can cause:
pain and stiffness of the big toe joint
swelling of the big toe joint – the foot may become so wide it can be difficult to find wide enough shoes
difficulty walking
Management of bunions
Wearing the right footwear is one of the best things you can do to help. Choose well fitting shoes. Ones with laces or an adjustable strap are best as they can adjust to the width of your foot. Avoid wearing high-heeled, pointed or tight shoes.
It may be helpful to use insoles and toe spacers to provide support for your foot or reduce pressure between your toes.
You may see bunion padding available. The repeated use of sticky padding can cause skin irritation so is not recommended as a regular solution.
Pain treatment
Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help with the management of this condition.
More about taking painkillers
Exercise
It can be helpful to do exercises to strengthen the muscles in the foot. This can help in the management of the condition
Work
A foot problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels
Help and support
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.

About chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.
CKD does not usually cause symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. It’s usually detected at earlier stages by blood and urine tests.
Symptoms of advanced kidney disease
The main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include:
tiredness
swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)
shortness of breath
nausea
blood in the urine

Diagnosing chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.
If you’re at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have:
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
diabetes
a family history of CKD

diagnosing chronic kidney disease
Why does it happen?
The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They’re located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also:
help maintain blood pressure
maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help heart and muscles function properly
produce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy
produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells
Chronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure.

causes of chronic kidney disease
Who is affected?
CKD is common and mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease.
It’s estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD.
CKD is more common in people of south Asian origin (those from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and black people than the general population. The reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south Asian people and higher rates of high blood pressure in African or Caribbean people.
Treating chronic kidney disease
There is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing.
People with CKD are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation.
In a minority of people, CKD may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF) or end-stage kidney disease. In this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working.
To survive, people with ERF may need to have artificial kidney treatment, called
dialysis
, or a kidney transplant.

treating chronic kidney disease
Living kidney donation
A kidney transplant from a living donor can be planned to avoid or reduce the time someone is on dialysis. This can offer a better long term outcome for the person receiving the organ.
There are 2 types of living kidney donation:
directed donation – a person can donate a kidney to someone they know, like a family member or a friend
altruistic kidney donation – a person can donate a kidney anonymously to someone they do not know

Preventing chronic kidney disease
The main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed.
Some lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of CKD developing, these include:
having a healthy diet
avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
exercising regularly
avoiding medicines that can damage the kidney
Read more about
preventing chronic kidney disease
Symptoms of chronic kidney disease
Most people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.
In other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.
A change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.
If the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include:
weight loss and poor appetite
swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)
shortness of breath
blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test)
an increased need to urinate, particularly at night
insomnia
itchy skin
muscle cramps
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
nausea
erectile dysfunction in men (an inability to get or maintain an erection)
These are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.
If you are worried by any of these symptoms, arrange to see your GP.
Causes of chronic kidney disease
Kidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys.
High blood pressure
(hypertension) and
diabetes
are the most common causes of kidney disease.
High blood pressure
Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. Too much pressure can damage your body’s organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function.
The cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown. There appears to be a link between the condition and a person’s general health, diet, and lifestyle.
Known risk factors for high blood pressure include:
age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older)
family history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families)
being of African-Caribbean or south Asian origin
obesity
lack of exercise
smoking
excessive alcohol consumption
high amount of salt in your diet
high-fat diet
stress
Hypertension causes damage by putting strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This prevents the filtering process from working properly.
Diabetes
Diabetes is a condition in which the body produces no – or too little – insulin (
type 1 diabetes
) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin (
type 2 diabetes
).
Insulin is needed to regulate levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals.
If diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. The glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids.
It is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. Around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage.
The first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. Therefore, your GP will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible.
All people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. Early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence.
Other causes
There are many other conditions that less commonly cause CKD, including:
glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney)
pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney)
polycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts)
failure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb
systemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue)
long-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, including aspirin and ibuprofen
blockages, for example due to
kidney stones
or prostate disease
Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.
Screening
If you are in a high-risk group for developing CKD, it is important to be regularly screened for the condition. People who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for CKD.
Annual screening is recommended for the following groups:
people with
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
people with
diabetes
people with acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium or
NSAIDs
such as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate
people with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or
heart failure
)
people with a family history of stage 5 CKD (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease
people with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause
Your GP can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for CKD.
Most often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. If this happens, the test is usually repeated to confirm the diagnosis.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
An effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min.
It is difficult to measure the GFR directly, so it is estimated using a formula. The result is called the estimated GFR or eGFR. Calculating your eGFR involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. The result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. For example, an eGFR of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function.
The following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine)
urine tests – used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine
albumin and creatinine testing – this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine, and the ratio of the 2 (the albumin:creatinine ratio or ACR) can be used with eGFR to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning
Staging
A 6-stage system, based on eGFR levels, is used to describe the progression of CKD. The higher the stage, the more severe the CKD.
Stage 1 (sometimes called G1): the eGFR is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage.
Stage 2 (G2): the eGFR has decreased slightly (60 to 89), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult.
If you have stage 1 or 2 CKD, it is recommended you have annual eGFR tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored.
Stage 3 is divided into 2: stage 3a (G3a) and 3b (G3b). In stage 3a, the eGFR has decreased mildly (45 to 59) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. In stage 3b (G3b) it has decreased moderately (30 to 44) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every 6 months.
Stage 4 (G4): the eGFR has reduced severely (15 to 29). By this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of CKD. Further testing should be carried out every 6 months.
Stage 5 (G5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an eGFR of below 15), which is known as established renal failure. Further testing should be carried out every 3 months.
However, over time, GFR can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have CKD. A diagnosis of CKD is usually only confirmed if repeated eGFR tests show your eGFR is consistently lower than normal over 3 months.
Other tests
Other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys:
kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan, are used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow – in cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape
kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage
Treating chronic kidney disease
Lifestyle changes
The following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD:
stopping smoking
eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet
restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day
not using over-the-counter
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional
moderating your alcohol intake so it is within
recommended limits
losing weight if you are overweight or obese
doing regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week
Read more about
preventing high blood pressure
through lifestyle changes.
Medications for high blood pressure
One of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to
manage high blood pressure
. Good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys.
People with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg.
There are many types of blood pressure drugs. Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD.
As well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels, ACE inhibitors give additional protection to the kidney.
ACE inhibitors include:
ramipril
enalapril
lisinopril
perindopril
Side effects of ACE inhibitors include:
a persistent, dry cough
dizziness
tiredness or weakness
headaches
Most of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough.
If the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB). This group of medicines includes:
candesartan
eprosartan
irbesartan
azilsartan
olmesartan
temisartan
valsartan
losartan
The side effects of ARBs are uncommon, but can include dizziness.
Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. If you are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it’s important to ask your doctor if the ACE inhibitor or ARB needs to be temporarily stopped.
Medication to reduce cholesterol
Studies have shown that people with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. This is because some of the risk factors for CKD are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis).
Statins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. Cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called HMG-CoA reductase), which is used to make cholesterol.
Statins sometimes have mild side effects, including:
constipation
diarrhoea
headaches
abdominal pain
Occasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your GP. You may need to have a blood test or change your treatment.
If you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. You may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before.
If you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. Your GP or dietitian can advise you about this.
The excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. You may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body.
If you do not have any fluid retention and you have not been told to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so. In fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.
Anaemia
Many people with stage three, four and five CKD develop
anaemia
. Anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anaemia include:
tiredness
lethargy
shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
palpitations (awareness of heartbeat)
Anaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out other possible causes.
Most people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. To boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions.
If this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. These injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously). Examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.
Correction of phosphate balance
If you have stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. Phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. Phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. The kidneys usually filter out excess phosphate. If phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. This can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries.
You may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. Foods high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. Your GP or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. However, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level. Always ask a healthcare professional before changing your diet.
If reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. These medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body.
To work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. The most commonly used phosphate binder is calcium carbonate, but there are also alternatives that may be more suitable for you.
The side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include:
nausea
stomach ache
constipation
diarrhoea
flatulence (wind)
skin rash
itchy skin
Vitamin D supplements
People with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones. This is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin D from food and the sun before it can be used by the body.
Treatment for kidney failure – transplant or dialysis
Many people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives.
In a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys stop working and it becomes life threatening. This is called kidney failure or established renal failure (ERF).
This rarely happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. The decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team.
Read more about
dialysis
and kidney transplants.
Supportive treatment
If you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you, you will be offered supportive treatment.
This is also called palliative care.
The aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. Supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and
planning for the end of life
.
Many people choose supportive treatment because they:
are unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment
do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis
are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits
have been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment
are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious physical illness, especially severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life
If you choose to have supportive treatment, your kidney unit will still look after you.
Doctors and nurses will make sure you receive:
medicines to protect your remaining kidney function for as long as possible
medicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin
help to plan your home and money affairs
bereavement support for your family after your death

What is good kidney disease care?
Kidney disease services should:
identify people at risk of kidney disease, especially people with high blood pressure or diabetes, and treat them as early as possible to maintain their kidney function
give people access to investigative treatment and follow them up to reduce the risk of the disease getting worse
give people good-quality information about managing their condition
provide information about the development of the disease and treatment options
provide access to a specialist renal (kidney) team
give people access to transplant or dialysis services if required
provide supportive care
Your treatment for kidney disease will need to be reviewed regularly.
It may be helpful for you to make a care plan because this can help you manage your day-to-day health. Your kidney disease specialist nurse may be able to help with this.
Preventing chronic kidney disease
In most cases, chronic kidney disease (CKD) cannot be completely prevented, although you can take steps to reduce the chances of the condition developing.
Managing your condition
If you have a chronic (long-term) condition, such as diabetes, that could potentially cause chronic kidney disease, it is important it is carefully managed.
Follow the advice of your GP and keep all appointments relating to your condition. People with diabetes are advised to have their kidney function tested every year.

Type 1 diabetes
and
Type 2 diabetes
Smoking
Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks or strokes, and it can increase the likelihood that any existing kidney problems will get worse.
If you stop smoking, you will improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer and heart disease.
The NHS smoking helpline can offer you advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking. Phone
Quit Your Way Scotland
on 0800 84 84 84.
Read more about
stopping smoking
Diet
A healthy diet is important for preventing chronic kidney disease. It will lower the amount of cholesterol in your blood and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (
5 a day
) and whole grains.
Limit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure. One teaspoonful of salt is equal to about 6g.
Avoid eating foods high in saturated fat because this will increase your cholesterol level.
Foods high in saturated fat include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter
ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)
lard
cream
hard cheese
cakes and biscuits
foods that contain coconut oil or palm oil
Eating some foods that are high in unsaturated fat can help decrease your cholesterol level. Foods high in unsaturated fat include:
oily fish
avocados
nuts and seeds
sunflower oil
rapeseed oil
olive oil
Read more about healthy
food and diet
Alcohol
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol will cause your blood pressure to rise, as well as raising cholesterol levels in your blood. Therefore, sticking to the
recommended alcohol consumption limits
is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and CKD.
Exercise
Regular exercise should help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing CKD.
At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, is recommended.

health and fitness
Painkillers
Kidney disease can be caused by the improper use (such as taking too many) of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)
, such as aspirin and
ibuprofen
.
If you need to take painkillers, make sure you follow the instructions. This can help to avoid kidney damage.
Living with chronic kidney disease
Relationships and support
Coming to terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they are close to you.
Learning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment.
Be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. However, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.
Get support
Your GP or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP practice will have information on these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or online.
Money and finances
If you have to stop work or work part time because of your kidney disease, you may find it hard to cope financially. You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:
if you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer
if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
if you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for
Disability Living Allowance
if you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get
Attendance Allowance
if you are caring for someone with kidney disease, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income
Sex and pregnancy
The symptoms of kidney disease and the stress it causes in your life can affect your sexual relationships.
Some couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find that their loved ones are affected by worries about how they will cope with the effects of the illness. Both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship.
Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.
People on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. Loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems.
Treatment is available, but it may take some time and requires commitment from both partners. The first step is to discuss it with your healthcare team.
Pregnancy
Both men and women with early stage kidney disease will find their fertility is unaffected. This means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby.
Later stage kidney disease may affect women’s periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. For men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. However, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so both men and women need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby.
Women who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease. Depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. Your healthcare team can advise you about this.
Holidays and insurance
If you have mild kidney disease or you’ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn’t pose additional health problems, whether you’re staying in the UK or going abroad.
If you’re on dialysis, you can still enjoy holidays provided you book your treatment before you go away.
If you’re on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. It can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the UK than it is abroad.
The NHS will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the UK. If you’re in Europe, the
European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)
entitles you to free or reduced-cost hospital treatment.
It’s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the EHIC. Anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. It may exclude you from some policies.
Using over-the-counter medicines
Some remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. Make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine.
You’re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if:
you have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal)
you have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart disease
What’s safe and what’s not
Summarised below is a list of which over the counter remedies are safe for people with kidney disease to use and which should be avoided. This is just a guide. For more detailed information, consult your pharmacist, renal specialist or GP.
Headaches
Paracetamol is safe and the best choice of painkiller to treat a headache, but avoid soluble products as they are high in sodium. If your kidney function is less than about 50%, avoid painkillers containing aspirin,
ibuprofen
or similar drugs such as diclofenac. These products can deteriorate the function of damaged kidneys.
Low-dose aspirin
of 75mg to 150mg a day can be used if it’s prescribed for the prevention of vascular disease. You should also avoid ibuprofen if you’re taking anti-rejection treatment following a kidney transplant.
Coughs and colds
Many of the products available for coughs and colds contain a mixture of ingredients, so check the packaging carefully. Some products contain paracetamol, which is safe, but others contain high doses of aspirin, which it’s best to avoid.
Many cold remedies also contain
decongestants
, which you should avoid if you have high blood pressure. The best way to clear congestion is by steam inhalation with menthol or eucalyptus. For coughs, try a simple linctus or glycerine honey and lemon to soothe your throat.
Muscle and joint pains
If you have muscle or joint pain, it’s ideal to use topical preparations (applied to the skin), which are rubbed on to the painful area. Avoid tablets containing ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac if your kidney function is below 50%. Ibuprofen gel or spray is safer than ibuprofen tablets, but it isn’t completely risk-free as a small amount of the drug penetrates the skin into the bloodstream.
Kidney failure
About 1% of people with stage three CKD develop kidney failure, also called established renal failure (ERF). Kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. People diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition.
Choices if you have established renal failure
If you have established renal failure (ERF), you will need to decide whether to have treatment with
dialysis
or a kidney transplant. You may decide to have neither treatment and to have supportive care. These choices should be made with your healthcare team.
For people who want active treatment for their ERF, a transplant would be the best option. However, a transplant is only suitable for about half of all people with ERF. This is because they may have had recent cancer or are not physically fit.
Many people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. Supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.
Transplant
A kidney transplant, when suitable, is the best treatment for ERF. The transplanted kidney can be obtained from a deceased or living donor and survival rates are now extremely good. About 90% of transplants still function after five years and many transplants work usefully after 20 years. The main reason people have to wait for a transplant is the shortage of available donors.
Over a third of kidney transplants are now from live donors. A live donor kidney can be transplanted before the need for dialysis, rather than after a period of time on dialysis.
One major risk after transplantation is rejection, where the immune system attacks the donated kidney because it mistakes it for a foreign object. This is prevented with the use of strong drugs to suppress the immune system. These drugs need to be taken meticulously. They are usually well tolerated but may have side effects, including an increased susceptibility to infections and some forms of cancer. For this reason, transplant patients are given regular reviews in a specialist transplant clinic.
Dialysis
Dialysis can take place at home or in hospital. It involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. It is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. They also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). There are 2 types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.
Peritoneal dialysis
The abdomen (tummy) has a lining called the peritoneal membrane, which can be used as a filter to remove excess waste and water. If you have opted for peritoneal dialysis, a tube (catheter) will be inserted into your abdomen during an operation. This will allow you to drain dialysis fluid in and out of your tummy yourself. You will not need to go into hospital to be treated, but you will have to spend an hour or two each day draining the fluid. The treatment involves either four exchanges spaced out during the day, each taking half an hour, or attaching yourself to a machine overnight that pumps the fluid in and out for you.
Haemodialysis
Haemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid that build up in the body when the kidneys stop working. Blood is taken from the body to be cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. It is effectively an artificial kidney. The whole process takes about four hours and usually has to be repeated three times a week. Most people go into hospital to have haemodialysis. However, some people choose to have the treatment in their own home.
Home haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. You’ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. Some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. Most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted.
Quality vascular access
During haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. This requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. For this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). This is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least 6 weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used.
Occasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. In this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. A catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid.
All the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made."

Chilblains are small, itchy swellings on the skin that occur as a reaction to cold temperatures.
They most often affect the body’s extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose.
Chilblains can be uncomfortable, but rarely cause any permanent damage. They normally heal within a few weeks if further exposure to the cold is avoided.
Chilblains can turn the skin red and may cause a burning or stinging sensation.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
In severe cases, chilblains can cause the skin to blister.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Signs and symptoms of chilblains
Chilblains usually develop several hours after exposure to the cold. They typically cause a burning and itching sensation in the affected areas, which can become more intense if you go into a warm room.
The affected skin may also swell and turn red or dark blue.
In severe cases, the surface of the skin may break and sores or
blisters
can develop.
It’s important not to scratch the skin as it can break easily and become infected.
When to seek medical advice for chilblains
Most people don’t need to seek medical advice if they have chilblains as they usually heal within a few weeks and don’t cause any permanent problems.
Speak to your GP or chiropodist if you have:
severe or recurring chilblains
chilblains that don’t improve within a few weeks
You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may have become infected.
Signs of infection include:
swelling and pus forming in the affected area
feeling generally unwell
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
swollen glands
What causes chilblains?
Chilblains are the result of an abnormal reaction to the cold. They’re common in the UK because damp, cold weather is usual in the winter.
Some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter.
When the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider.
If this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow.
This can cause blood to leak into the surrounding tissue, which may cause the swelling and itchiness associated with chilblains.
Who’s more at risk of chilblains?
Some people are more at risk of chilblains than others.
This includes people with:
poor circulation
a family history of chilblains
regular exposure to cold, damp or draughty conditions
a poor diet or low body weight
lupus
– a long-term condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues
Raynaud’s phenomenon – a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toes
People who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels.
Chilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure, such as a
bunion
or a toe that’s squeezed by tight shoes.
Treating chilblains
Chilblains often get better on their own after a week or two without treatment.
It may help to use a soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, to relieve itching. Your pharmacist may also be able to recommend a suitable product.
If your chilblains are severe and keep returning, speak to your GP. They may recommend taking a daily tablet or capsule of a medication called nifedipine. This works by relaxing the blood vessels, improving your circulation.
Nifedipine can be used to help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken during the winter to stop them developing.
Preventing chilblains
If you’re susceptible to chilblains, you can reduce your risk of developing them by:
limiting your exposure to the cold
looking after your feet
taking steps to improve your circulation
If your skin gets cold, it’s important to warm it up gradually. Heating the skin too quickly – for example, by placing your feet in hot water or near a heater – is one of the main causes of chilblains.
Do
stop smoking – nicotine causes the blood vessels to constrict, which can make chilblains worse
keep active – this helps improve your circulation
wear warm clothes and insulate your hands, feet and legs – wearing long johns, long boots, tights, leg warmers or long socks will help, and it’s a good idea to wear a clean pair of socks if you get cold feet in bed
avoid tight shoes and boots – these can restrict the circulation to your toes and feet
moisturise your feet regularly – this stops them drying out and the skin cracking
eat at least one hot meal during the day – this’ll help warm your whole body, particularly in cold weather
warm your shoes on the radiator before you put them on – make sure damp shoes are dry before you wear them; if your feet are already cold, make sure your shoes aren’t too hot to avoid causing chilblains
warm your hands before going outdoors – soak them in warm water for several minutes and dry thoroughly, and wear cotton-lined waterproof gloves if necessary; if your hands are already cold, make sure not to warm them up too quickly to avoid causing chilblains
keep your house well heated – try to keep one room in the house warm and avoid drafts
if you’re diabetic, regularly check your feet (or ask someone else to do this) – people with diabetes may not be able to feel their feet and could have infected chilblains without realising it
Complications of chilblains
If you have severe or recurring chilblains, there’s a small risk of further problems developing, such as:
infection from blistered or scratched skin
ulcers forming on the skin
permanent discolouration of the skin
scarring of the skin
Avoiding complications of chilblains
It’s often possible to avoid complications of chilblains.
Don’t
do not scratch or rub the affected areas of skin
do not directly overheat the chilblains (by using hot water, for example)
You can also help reduce your risk of infection by cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic and covering the area with an antiseptic dressing. The dressing should be changed every other day until the skin heals.
If the skin does become infected,
antibiotics
may be prescribed to treat the infection."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/chickenpox/,"Chickenpox
Chickenpox is a mild and common illness that mostly affects children but can be caught at any age.
Causes of chickenpox
Chickenpox (known medically as varicella) is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It’s spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected.
Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. Children usually catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May.
Symptoms of chickenpox
Chickenpox causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled
blisters
. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off.
Chickenpox spots
The spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:
behind the ears
on the face
over the scalp
on the chest and belly
on the arms and legs
But, the spots can be anywhere on the body, including:
inside the ears and mouth
on the palms of the hands
soles of the feet
inside the nappy area.
The rash starts as small, itchy red spots. These develop a
blister
on top and become very itchy after about 12 to 14 hours.
After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.
After 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.
New spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.
Before chickenpox spots appear
Before the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild
flu
-like symptoms, including:
feeling sick
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
aching, painful muscles
headache
generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite
These symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.
Contacting your doctor about chickenpox
For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.
Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. Adults have a higher risk of developing complications.
Contact your GP practice if:
You or your child develop any abnormal symptoms, such as:
the skin around the blisters becomes hot, red and painful, (redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin)
pain in the chest or difficulty breathing
signs of
dehydration
, such as fewer wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet
blisters on their skin become infected
any of your or your child’s symptoms suddenly get worse
or
You have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and:
you are pregnant or have given birth in the last 7 days
you have a weakened immune system (the body’s defence system)
your baby is less than 4 weeks old
you are breastfeeding
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Contact your GP practice if:
you’re not sure if you or your child has chickenpox
you’re worried about your child
Tell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a GP practice.
Chickenpox treatment
There is no treatment for chickenpox. But, you can get remedies from your pharmacy that can help symptoms. These include:
paracetamol
to help bring down a fever
calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.
In most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within 1 to 2 weeks.
Adults with chickenpox may be helped by taking antiviral medicine if its diagnosed early enough.
Stopping the spread of chickenpox
You should keep children off school or nursery until all their spots have crusted over. This will help stop chickenpox being spread.
Adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over.
Chickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts. It stops being infectious when all the blisters have crusted over. This happens usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash.
If you or your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas. This will help them avoid contact with people who may not have had it.
You should especially stay away from people who are at risk of serious problems, such as:
newborn babies
pregnant women
anyone with a weakened immune system, (for example people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets)
Who’s at higher risk from chickenpox?
Some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include:
pregnant women
newborn babies
people with a weakened immune system
These people should speak to their GP as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms.
They may need a
blood test
to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox.
Chickenpox in pregnancy
If you’re pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications.
Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies.
Your risk of developing
pneumonia
is slightly higher if you’re pregnant, especially if you smoke. The further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be.
If you get chickenpox while you’re pregnant, there is also a small but significant risk to your unborn baby.
If you get chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (FVS).
This syndrome is rare.
FVS can cause serious complications, including:
scarring
eye defects, such as cataracts
shortened limbs
brain damage
There are also other risks from catching chickenpox after week 20 of pregnancy.
It’s possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy).
If you are infected with chickenpox 7 days before or 7 days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. In a few severe cases, this type of chickenpox can be fatal.
Chickenpox and shingles
Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again.
But, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, stays inactive in your body’s nerve tissues. This can come back later in life as an illness called shingles.
It’s possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.
Read more about
shingles
.
Is there a vaccine against chickenpox?
There is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.
Only children and adults who are more vulnerable to the complications of chickenpox will get offered the vaccine.
It may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. There is also a chance that someone who has had the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming into close contact with a person who has shingles."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/myalgic-encephalomyelitis-me-or-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cfs/,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term (chronic) neurological condition that affects the nervous and immune systems.
People with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion.
ME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn’t go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It can sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).
Symptoms of ME/CFS
The symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you’ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.
If you experience new symptoms, talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME/CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.
Post-exertional malaise
People with ME/CFS experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with PEM. This is the body and brain’s inability to recover after using even small amounts of energy.
Simple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with ME/CFS feeling completely exhausted. It can also lead to an increase in other symptoms.
Other symptoms of ME/CFS include:
feeling generally unwell
pain
broken sleep
problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’)
speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties
poor temperature control
dizziness
being very sensitive to light and sound
nausea
loss of appetite
muscle pain (myalgia)
For more information on the symptoms of ME/CFS visit the
Action for M.E.
website.
Frustration,
anxiety
, low mood and
depression
are sometimes experienced by people with ME/CFS because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME/CFS is a mental health condition.
Causes of ME/CFS
Further research is needed to confirm what causes ME/CFS. There might be various factors involved and there may be a number of different types of the illness. These different sub-groups still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops.
ME/CFS may appear suddenly or more slowly over time. It may follow an infection, typically, but not always, viral.
Other possible triggers can be:
trauma
surgery
stressful major life events
In some cases, there may be no identifiable trigger.
How is ME/CFS diagnosed?
There’s no single test to detect ME/CFS. A diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded.
The earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME/CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist.
Your GP will usually:
do a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions
ask about recent travel, tick or insect bites, unusual infections, and drug and alcohol use
review current medication
arrange tests
They may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. Anyone suspected of having ME/CFS should be considered for routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. More investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt.
Some people with ME/CFS also have another long-term condition and it’s important that you talk to your GP about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions.
Treating ME/CFS
Although there’s no cure for ME/CFS, there are ways to help manage your symptoms.
Because of the complexity of the illness different things work for different people. Your GP may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms.
To decide what treatment is right for you, you should look at the evidence, including published research and patient surveys. Make sure you fully understand what the treatment involves before you make a decision. You have the right to decline any treatment option you do not feel comfortable with.
Your GP may suggest some of the following treatment options.
Management of medicines
Your GP may suggest reviewing and changing the medicines you take. They’ll consider other conditions you may already be receiving treatment for alongside the most important ME/CFS symptoms that need to be treated.
Your GP may also need to consider the combined impact of medication for symptoms and possibly for managing other conditions, especially as sensitivity to medicine is a feature of ME/CFS. This could mean there may be issues around polypharmacy (use of many medications) for your healthcare professional to consider.
Dietary advice
Your illness might make it more difficult for you to eat the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. Your GP may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet.
Disability support advice
Your GP may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust.
Pacing advice
Balancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of PEM.
Pacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. It’s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. It can take time to change your habits and stop doing something even while things are going well. However, doing this is key to managing your condition in the long term.
Counselling
Counselling can support you to adjust to the impact ME/CFS can have on your life. This does not mean that the condition itself is psychological.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT should only be delivered by a healthcare professional with the right training and experience in CBT for ME/CFS. The 2021 NICE guidelines suggest that CBT might help some people with ME/CFS manage their symptoms.
CBT can sometimes be used to help changes in mood that can come with having a long-term condition.
Alternative and holistic therapies
Alternative or holistic therapies may provide some comfort but be cautious of any method that claims to offer a cure for ME/CFS.
You should discuss any alternative or holistic therapy with your GP before you try it. Until further research is done, no one can be certain whether someone with ME/CFS might benefit from alternative therapies.
Living with ME/CFS
There are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition. Small changes make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management.
To help with this, you might try:
Planning your time
Record what you do so that you can build a picture of what uses more energy and what activities you can ask others to do for you. This will show you if there are patterns of symptoms and when they appear during your day.
Rest and relaxation
This is very important for managing ME/CFS. You may need some support and advice on what that might mean for you in terms of your physical, mental and emotional activities for resting.
Getting support
Being open with people and asking for help when you need it before you’re exhausted is a key approach to managing your condition. Talking about how you’re feeling is important for long term health conditions because of the impact your symptoms have on the way you live your life. Talk to your GP about emotional support available to you.
How will ME/CFS affect my quality of life?
Not everyone will experience the same symptoms so it’s important not to compare people with ME/CFS. People with ME/CFS can have very different experiences of the condition and how long their symptoms last.
The impact of symptoms can be:
mild
moderate
severe
very severe
As symptoms change over time so does the impact they have on people’s lives.
How long will it last?
Most people with ME/CFS improve over time, although some people don’t make a full recovery. It’s also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with ME/CFS are more likely to recover fully.
Where can I get support?
ME/CFS can have a significant emotional and financial impact on your life. A lack of understanding and awareness about ME/CFS means patients can experience disbelief, and even discrimination, from friends, family, health and social care professionals and employers.
Information on entitlements to welfare benefits, accessing health and social care and others sources of support for patients and carers are available from
Action for M.E
. They also offer resources and services for children and young people affected by ME/CFS and their families.
Peer support
In some regions of Scotland there are local support groups providing peer support, information and advice.
ALISS
and
Action for ME
can assist with signposting to these groups."

About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years.
It mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40. Children are almost never affected.
In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow) produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that aren’t fully developed and don’t work properly.
Over time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness, swollen glands in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising.
CLL is different from other types of leukaemia, including
chronic myeloid leukaemia
,
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
and
acute myeloid leukaemia
.
Symptoms of CLL
CLL doesn’t usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a
blood test
carried out for another reason.
When symptoms develop, they may include:
getting infections often
anaemia – persistent tiredness,
shortness of breath
and pale skin
bleeding and bruising more easily than normal
a high temperature (fever)
night sweats
swollen glands
in your neck, armpits or groin
swelling and discomfort in your tummy
unintentional weight loss
You should speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. These symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
Read more about
diagnosing CLL
and
complications of CLL
.
Treatments for CLL
As CLL progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately.
If it’s caught early on, you’ll have regular check-ups over the following months or years to see if it’s getting any worse.
If CLL starts to cause symptoms, or isn’t diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are:
chemotherapy
– where medication is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells
a
stem cell or bone marrow transplant
– where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells
Treatment can’t usually cure CLL completely, but can slow its progression and lead to periods where there are no symptoms. Treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back.
Read more about
treating CLL
.
Outlook for CLL
The outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it’s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and your general health.
Younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when CLL is still in the early stages generally have the best outlook.
Although it can’t normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years.
Causes of CLL
It’s not clear what causes CLL. There’s no proven link with
radiation
or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can’t catch it from anyone else or pass it on.
However, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing CLL. You may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.
Diagnosing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason.
However, you should speak to your GP if you have worrying
symptoms of CLL
, such as persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats.
Your GP may:
ask about your symptoms and your medical and family history
carry out a physical examination to check for problems such as
swollen glands
and a swollen spleen
send off a blood sample for testing
If your GP thinks you could have CLL, you’ll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests.
Blood tests
The main test used to help diagnose CLL is a type of
blood test
called a full blood count.
This is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory.
An abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells (lymphocytes) can be a sign of CLL. A detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis.
X-rays and scans
You may also have:
a chest
X-ray
an
ultrasound
of your tummy
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
These tests can check for problems caused by CLL, such as swollen glands or a swollen spleen, and help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
Bone marrow biopsy
Sometimes the haematologist may recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow (bone marrow biopsy) so they can examine it under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells.
The sample is removed using a needle inserted into your hip bone.
Local anaesthetic
is normally used to numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy.
The procedure will last around 15 minutes and you shouldn’t need to stay in hospital overnight. You may have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards.
Lymph node biopsy
In some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of CLL. This is known as a lymph node biopsy.
The gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or
general anaesthetic
, where you’re asleep. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight.
After the operation, you’ll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches.
Genetic tests
Tests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells.
Identifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you.
Some
treatments for CLL
don’t work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells.
Treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it’s diagnosed.
You may just need to be monitored at first if it’s caught early on.
Chemotherapy
is the main treatment if it’s more advanced.
Treatment can often help keep CLL under control for many years.
It may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again.
Stages of CLL
Doctors use stages to describe how far CLL has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated.
There are 3 main stages of CLL:
stage A – you have enlarged lymph glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count
stage B – you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count
stage C – you have enlarged lymph glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count
Stage B and C CLL are usually treated straight away. Stage A generally only needs to be treated if it’s getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms.
Monitoring early-stage CLL
Treatment may not be needed if you don’t have any symptoms when you’re diagnosed with CLL.
This is because:
CLL often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for many years
there’s no benefit in starting treatment early
treatment can cause significant side effects
In these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and
blood tests
to monitor the condition.
Treatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse.
Chemotherapy for more advanced CLL
Many people with CLL will eventually need to have chemotherapy. This involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control.
There are a number of different medicines for CLL, but most people will take 3 main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days.
These medicines are:
fludarabine – usually taken as a tablet for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle
cyclophosphamide – also usually taken as a tablet for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle
rituximab – given into a vein over the course of a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the start of each treatment cycle
Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. Rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight.
A number of different medicines can also be tried if you can’t have these medicines, you’ve tried them but they didn’t work, or your CLL has come back after treatment.
These include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a
steroid medication
).
Side effects of treatment
The medicines used to treat CLL can cause some significant side effects, including:

Stem cell or bone marrow transplants
Stem cell or bone marrow transplants
are sometimes used to try to get rid of CLL completely, or control it for longer periods.
Stem cells are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells.
A stem cell transplant involves:
having high-dose chemotherapy and
radiotherapy
to destroy the cancerous cells in your body
removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of a donor – this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling
transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins
This is the only potential cure for CLL, but it’s not done very often as it’s an intensive treatment and many people with CLL are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks.
The initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy can place a significant strain on your body and cause troublesome side effects.
There’s also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. This is where the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body.
Other treatments for CLL
There are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by CLL, particularly if you can’t have chemotherapy or it doesn’t work.
These include:
radiotherapy
to shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen
surgery to remove a swollen spleen
antibiotics
, antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment
blood transfusions
to provide more red blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising
immunoglobulin replacement therapy – a transfusion of antibodies taken from donated blood that can help prevent infections
injections of medication called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help boost the number of white blood cells
You may also need additional treatment for any
complications of CLL
that develop.
Deciding against treatment
As many of the treatments for CLL can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment.
This is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make.
You won’t be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends.
Pain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.
Complications of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can sometimes cause a number of further complications.
Infections
People with CLL usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells.
Treatment with
chemotherapy
can also further weaken the immune system.
If you have CLL, it’s a good idea to:
report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles,
diarrhoea
or
headaches
ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date – speak to your GP or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren’t safe if you have a weak immune system
avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it’s an infection to which you were previously immune, such as
chickenpox
You may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such as
antibiotics
to help reduce the risk of infection.
Richter’s syndrome
In up to 1 in every 20 people with CLL, the condition will change to become very similar to an aggressive form of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
. This is called Richter’s transformation or Richter’s syndrome.
Symptoms of Richter’s syndrome include:
sudden swelling of your lymph glands
a high temperature (fever)
night sweats
unintentional weight loss
tummy (abdominal) pain
Richter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information on
Richter’s syndrome
.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Around 1 in every 10 people with CLL will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
This is where the immune system starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. It can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired.
It’s usually treated with
steroid medication
Psychological effects
Being diagnosed with CLL can be very distressing and difficult to take in at first, particularly as it can’t necessarily be cured and you may be advised to wait for it to get worse before starting treatment.
Having to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious or
depressed
. Speak to your GP or care team if you’re finding it difficult to cope.
You may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or care team will be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area.
Macmillan Cancer Support
provides an excellent level of help and support. Their helpline number is
0808 808 00 00

Causes of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
It’s not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. However, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
Risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include:
having a family history of the condition
being of European, American or Australian origin
having certain medical conditions
being male
Family history
In some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. It’s thought that an inherited gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. This means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you’ll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
More research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly increases your chances of also developing the condition.
Ethnicity
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of European, American and Australian origin.
It’s rare in people from China, Japan and South East Asia, and it affects more white people than black people. It’s not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others.
Other medical conditions
Research has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These conditions include:
pneumonia (chest infection)
sinusitis
shingles
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
long-term (chronic)
osteoarthritis
prostatitis (an inflamed prostate)
However, rather than causing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition.
Having a lowered immunity due to having a condition such as
HIV or AIDS
, or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
Radiation exposure
Exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but it’s not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the
risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
.
Sex and age
For reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. The risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/chest-pain/,"Chest pain
Phone 999 immediately if:
You or someone else has symptoms like:
central chest pain or discomfort in the chest that doesn’t go away – it may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing
pain that radiates down the left arm, or both arms, or to the neck, jaw, back or stomach
unconsciousness
seizures or fitting
difficulty breathing (snoring or rasping)
rapid heart beat
low or undetectable heart beat
chest pain and breathlessness, nausea, sweating or coughing up blood
Causes of chest pain
There are a number of different conditions that can cause chest pain. You should always seek medical advice to make sure you get a proper diagnosis.
Depending on your symptoms and circumstances, you may need further investigation.
Heart attack
A
heart attack
occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart is suddenly blocked.
Chest pain is more likely to be caused by a heart attack if it:
lasts more than 15 minutes
occurs while resting
Angina
Angina
is a condition where the blood supply to the muscles of the heart is restricted.
Chest pain caused by angina is usually triggered by physical activity (exertion). It usually gets better with rest after a few minutes.
Pulmonary embolism
A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This can cause sharp, stabbing chest pain that may get worse when you breathe in. It can also be accompanied by:
breathlessness
a cough
dizziness
coughing up blood
Pericarditis
Pericarditis is inflammation of the sac surrounding your heart. This can cause a sudden, sharp and stabbing pain in your chest. It may also cause more of a dull ache. This pain usually gets worse when you lie down.
Lung conditions
Lung conditions that can cause chest pain include:
pneumonia
– inflammation of the lungs (usually caused by an infection)
pleurisy
– inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lungs (usually caused by an infection)
Conditions affecting the lungs can cause sharp chest pain that:
gets worse when you breathe in and out
is accompanied by other symptoms like coughing or breathlessness
If someone has severe pneumonia or pleurisy, they may also have symptoms like:
rapid breathing
confusion
Seek medical advice immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of:
a heart attack
angina
a pulmonary embolism
pericarditis
pneumonia
pleurisy
Other causes of chest pain
There are many other potential causes of chest pain, including:
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– acid from the stomach comes up into the oesophagus (gullet) causing burning chest pain (heartburn) and an unpleasant taste in the mouth
acute cholecystitis
– inflammation of the gallbladder that can cause a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy that spreads towards your right shoulder
strained muscle – can cause chest pain that’s painful and tender to touch
costochondritis
– inflammation in the cartilage that joins the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) that can cause pain, swelling and tenderness around the ribs
panic attack
or
anxiety
– can sometimes be accompanied by chest pain"

About COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.
People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction.
Typical symptoms of COPD include:
increasing breathlessness when active
a persistent cough with phlegm
frequent chest infections
Read more about the
symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Why does COPD happen?
The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring.
Over many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD.
Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer.
Read more about the
causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Who is affected?
COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s.
It is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the UK, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a ‘smoker’s cough’.
COPD affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing.
Diagnosis
It is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms of COPD.
COPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests.
Read more about
diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Treating COPD
Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this.
Treatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you are capable of doing.
Surgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD.
Read more about
treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Living with COPD
COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact.
Simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible, learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD.
Financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care is also available for people with COPD.
Read more about
living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
.
Can COPD be prevented?
Although COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle.
If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition.
Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 or read more about
stopping smoking
.
Also avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible.
Symptoms of COPD
Symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually develop over a number of years, so you may not be aware you have the condition.
COPD does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35 and most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old.
See your GP if you have the following symptoms:
increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around
a persistent cough with phlegm that never seems to go away
frequent
chest infections
, particularly in winter
wheezing
Middle-aged smokers and ex-smokers who have a persistent chesty cough (especially in the morning), breathlessness on slight exertion or persistent coughs and colds in the winter should see their GP or practice nurse for a simple breathing test.
If you have COPD, the airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. As the air sacs get permanently damaged, it will become increasingly difficult to breathe out.
While there is currently no cure for COPD, the sooner the condition is diagnosed and appropriate treatment begins, the less chance there is of severe lung damage.
Read more about
treating COPD
.
Flare-ups
Symptoms of COPD are often worse in winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up (also known as an exacerbation) is when your symptoms are particularly bad. This is one of the most common reasons for people being admitted to hospital in the UK.
If you’re experiencing a flare-up that is worse than normal day to day, you should visit your GP or call NHS 24 on 111.
Other signs of COPD
Other signs of COPD can include:
weight loss
tiredness and fatigue
swollen ankles
Chest pain and coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common symptoms of COPD. They are usually caused by other conditions such as a
chest infection
or, less commonly,
lung cancer
.
Causes of COPD
There are several things that may increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), many of which can be avoided.
Things you can change
You can reduce your risk of developing COPD by not smoking and avoiding exposure to certain substances at work.
Smoking
Smoking is the main cause of COPD and is thought to be responsible for around 90% of cases. The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and permanently damaged by smoking and this damage cannot be reversed.
Up to 25% of smokers develop COPD.
Passive smoking
Exposure to other people’s smoke increases the risk of COPD.
Fumes and dust
Exposure to certain types of dust and chemicals at work, including grains, isocyanates, cadmium and coal, has been linked to the development of COPD, even in people who do not smoke.
The risk of COPD is even higher if you breathe in dust or fumes in the workplace and you smoke.
Air pollution
According to some research, air pollution may be an additional risk factor for COPD. However, at the moment it is not conclusive and research is continuing.
Read further information:

treatments to help you stop smoking
Health and Safety Executive: COPD
Things you cannot change
There are a few factors for COPD that you cannot change.
Having a brother or sister with severe COPD
A research study has shown that smokers who have brothers and sisters with severe COPD are at greater risk of developing the condition than smokers who do not.
Having a genetic tendency to COPD
There is a rare genetic tendency to develop COPD called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This causes COPD in a small number of people (about 1%). Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein that protects your lungs. Without it, the lungs can be damaged by other enzymes that occur naturally in the body.
People who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop COPD at a younger age, often under 35.
Read further information:

Diagnosing COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, as well as breathing tests.
If you are concerned about the health of your lungs and have symptoms that could be COPD, see your GP as soon as you can.
Being diagnosed early means you will receive appropriate treatment, advice and help to stop or slow the progression of COPD.
At a consultation, your doctor will ask about your symptoms, how long you have had them, and whether you smoke, or used to smoke. They will examine you and listen to your chest using a stethoscope. You may also be weighed and measured to calculate your body mass index (BMI).
Your doctor will also check how well your lungs are working with a lung function test called spirometery.
Spirometry
To assess how well your lungs work, a breathing test called spirometry is carried out. You will be asked to breathe into a machine called a spirometer.
The spirometer takes two measurements: the volume of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second or FEV
1
) and the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity or FVC).
You may be asked to breathe out a few times to get a consistent reading.
The readings are compared with normal measurements for your age, which can show if your airways are obstructed.
Other tests
You may have other tests as well as spirometry. Often, these other tests will help the doctor rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms.
Chest X-ray
A chest
X-ray
will show whether you have another lung condition which may be causing symptoms, such as a
chest infection
or lung cancer.
Blood test
A
blood test
will show whether your symptoms could be due to
anaemia
, as this can also cause breathlessness.
Further tests
Some people may need more tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis or indicate the severity of your COPD. This will help you and your doctor plan your treatment.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram may be used to check the condition of your heart.
An ECG involves attaching electrodes (sticky metal patches) to your arms, legs and chest to pick up the electrical signals from your heart.
An echocardiogram uses sound waves to build a detailed picture of your heart. This is similar to an
ultrasound scan
.
Peak flow test
To confirm you have COPD and not asthma, you may be asked to take regular measurements of your breathing using a peak flow meter, at different times over several days. The peak flow meter measures how fast you can breathe out.
Blood oxygen level
The level of oxygen in your blood is measured using a pulse oximeter, which looks like a peg and is attached to the finger. If you have low levels of oxygen, you may need an assessment to see whether extra oxygen would help you.
Blood test for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
If the condition runs in your family or you developed the symptoms of COPD under the age of 35 and have never smoked, you will probably have a blood test to see if you are alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient.
Computerised tomography (CT) scan
Some people may need a
CT scan
. This provides more information than an X-ray and can be useful in diagnosing other lung diseases or assessing changes to your lungs due to COPD.
Other breathing tests
If your symptoms seem worse than would be expected from your spirometry results, your doctor may decide you need more detailed lung function tests. You may be referred to a hospital specialist for these tests.
Phlegm sample
The doctor may take a sample of phlegm (sputum) to check whether it has been infected.
Treating COPD
Stop smoking
Stopping smoking
is the most effective way for people with COPD to help themselves feel better and is the only proven way to reduce the rate of decline in lung function.
Stopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. Any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed, but giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens.
If COPD is in the early stages and symptoms are mild, no other treatments may be needed. However, it is never too late to stop smoking. Even people with fairly advanced COPD are likely to benefit from quitting, which may prevent further damage to the airways.
Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to give up smoking successfully if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as tablets, patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this.
Read more about
stopping smoking
.
Inhalers
If an inhaler is prescribed for you, your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist can explain how to use it. They will check you are using it properly.
Most people learn to use an inhaler successfully, but if you are having problems, a spacer or a different type of inhaler device may help you take your medicines correctly. A spacer is a device that increases the amount of medication that reaches the lungs.
Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers
Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up.
There are two types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler:
beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline
antimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropium
The inhaler should be used when you feel breathless and this should relieve the symptoms.
Long-acting bronchodilator inhalers
If a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not help relieve your symptoms, your GP may recommend a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler. This works in a similar way to a short-acting bronchodilator, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours.
There are two types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers:
beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol
antimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium
Steroid inhalers
Steroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, work by reducing the inflammation in your airways.
If you are still getting breathless or having flare-ups even when taking long-acting bronchodilator inhalers, your GP may suggest including a steroid inhaler as part of your treatment. Most people with COPD will be prescribed a steroid inhaler as part of a combination inhaler.
Medicines
Theophylline tablets
If you are getting breathless or having flare-ups when using a combination of inhalers, your GP may prescribe theophylline tablets. Theophylline causes the muscles of your airways to relax and open up.
When you have been taking theophylline tablets regularly, you may need to give a blood sample to measure the amount of theophylline in your blood and help your GP prescribe the appropriate dose of tablet. This will allow you to get the correct dose of theophylline while reducing the likelihood of side effects.
Due to the risk of potential side effects, such as increased heart rate and headaches, other medicines, such as a bronchodilator inhaler, are usually tried before theophylline.
Mucolytic tablets or capsules
Mucolytics, such as carbocisteine, make the mucus and phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up. They are particularly beneficial for people with a persistent cough with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups.
Antibiotics and steroid tablets
If you have a chest infection, your GP may prescribe a short course of
antibiotics
.
Steroid tablets may also be prescribed as a short course if you have a bad flare-up. They work best if they are taken as the flare-up starts, so your GP may give you a course to keep at home. Occasionally, you may have to take a longer course of steroid tablets. Your GP will give you the lowest effective dose and monitor you for side effects. Side effects are uncommon if steroid tablets are given for less than three weeks.
Read more about the medicines used in the
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicines guide
.
Other types of treatment
Nebulised medication
Nebulised medication can be used for severe cases of COPD if other inhaler devices have not worked effectively. A compressor is a machine that administers nebulised medicine through a mouthpiece or a face mask. The medicine is in a liquid form and is converted into a fine mist. This enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go.
You can usually choose whether to use nebulised medication with a mouthpiece or a facemask. Your GP will advise you on how to use the machine correctly.
Long-term oxygen therapy
If the oxygen level in your blood is low, you may be advised to have oxygen at home through nasal tubes, also called a nasal cannula, or through a mask. Oxygen is not a treatment for breathlessness, but it is helpful for some patients with persistently low oxygen levels in the blood.
You will probably be referred for more detailed assessment to see whether you might benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.
If you are prescribed long term oxygen therapy, it must be taken for at least 15 hours a day to be effective. However, the longer you use it, the more effective it is.
The tubes from the machine are long so you will be able to move around your home while you are connected. Portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home.
The aim of long-term oxygen therapy is to extend your life.
Do not smoke when you are using oxygen. The increased level of oxygen produced is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could trigger a fire or explosion.
Ambulatory oxygen therapy
Part of the oxygen assessment is likely to consider if you may benefit from ambulatory oxygen – oxygen used when you walk or are active in other ways.
If your oxygen levels are normal while you are resting, but fall when you exercise, you may not need long-term oxygen therapy alongside ambulatory oxygen therapy.
Read more about
home oxygen treatment
.
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) helps a person breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face. You may receive it if you are taken to hospital because of a flare-up. You may be referred to a specialist centre to see if home NIV could help you. NIV is used to improve the functioning of your lungs.
Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a programme of exercise and education designed to help people with chronic lung problems. It can increase your exercise capacity, mobility and self-confidence.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is based on a programme of physical exercise training tailored to your needs. It usually involves walking or cycling, and arm and strength-building exercises. It also includes education about your disease for you and your family, dietary assessment and advice, and psychological, social and behavioural changes designed to help you cope better.
A rehabilitation programme is provided by a multidisciplinary team, which includes physiotherapists, respiratory nurse specialists and dietitians.
Pulmonary rehabilitation takes place in a group and the course usually lasts for about six weeks. During the course, you will learn more about your COPD and how to control your symptoms.
Pulmonary rehabilitation can greatly improve your quality of life."

About chronic pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation.
It’s different to
acute pancreatitis
, where the inflammation is only short-term.
The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain, which can be severe.
Other symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools.
Read more about the
symptoms of chronic pancreatitis
and
diagnosing chronic pancreatitis
.
When to seek medical advice
Always visit your GP if you’re experiencing severe pain – it’s a warning sign that something is wrong.
Why it happens
Long-term
alcohol misuse
is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas.
Less common causes include:
smoking
a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas
an inherited genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas
In as many as 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified – this is known as ‘idiopathic’ chronic pancreatitis.
Read more about the
causes of chronic pancreatitis
.
Who’s affected
Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54.
How it’s treated
In most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there’s no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas.
Treatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn’t respond to painkillers.
However, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life.
People who don’t smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis.

treating chronic pancreatitis
.
Complications
Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It’s important to speak to your GP if you’re experiencing
stress
,
anxiety
or
depression
caused by chronic pancreatitis.
Diabetes
is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin.
People with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing
pancreatic cancer
.
Read more about the possible
complications of chronic pancreatitis
.
Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis
The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems.
The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It’s been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases.
Some people also experience symptoms of
nausea and vomiting
during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.
Although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there’s often no trigger.
Eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.
Some people who
stop drinking alcohol
and
stop smoking
may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.
Advanced chronic pancreatitis
Additional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.
The absence of digestive juices makes it difficult for your digestive system to break down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet.
You may also experience:
weight loss
loss of appetite
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
symptoms of
diabetes
– such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired
ongoing nausea and vomiting
When to seek medical advice
Always visit your GP if you’re experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong.
You should also visit your GP if you develop symptoms of jaundice. Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it’s usually a sign that there’s something wrong with your digestive system.
You should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting.
Causes of chronic pancreatitis
Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a long period of time.
However, in up to 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause can’t be identified – known as ‘idiopathic’ chronic pancreatitis.
Alcohol consumption
Heavy drinking over many years can cause repeated episodes of
acute pancreatitis
. Acute pancreatitis is usually a short-term condition, but it can recur if you continue to drink alcohol.
Over time, repeated inflammation causes permanent damage to the pancreas, resulting in chronic pancreatitis.
Anyone who regularly consumes alcohol has an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, although only a minority develop the condition.

alcohol misuse
.
Problems with the immune system
Rare cases of chronic pancreatitis are the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the pancreas. This is known as ‘autoimmune pancreatitis’ and it’s not clear exactly why it happens.
Many people with autoimmune pancreatitis also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. These include
ulcerative colitis
or
Crohn’s disease
, both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system.
Genetics
Some cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. This is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called PRSS1 and SPINK-1. These mutations disrupt the normal working of the pancreas.
Genetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. Evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol.
Certain mutations of the CFTR gene, responsible for
cystic fibrosis
, are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases.
Other causes
Several other rare causes of chronic pancreatitis have also been identified, including:
injury to the pancreas
blocked or narrowed openings (ducts) of the pancreas
smoking
radiotherapy
to the abdomen (tummy)
Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a simple physical examination, but they’ll refer you for further tests if they suspect chronic pancreatitis.
These tests are usually carried out in your local hospital and may include:
requesting a stool sample
an
ultrasound scan
– where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas
an endoscopic ultrasonography
a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP
Endoscopic ultrasonography
During an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it.
You’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.
MRCP
An MRCP involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner
.
An MRI scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body.
An MRCP is a useful way of checking whether
gallstones
may be contributing to your symptoms.
Biopsy
Sometimes, the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to
pancreatic cancer
. Therefore, if you have symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and weight loss, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
A
biopsy
involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells.
A biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. The needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or CT scan. Alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography.
Treating chronic pancreatitis
Treatment for chronic pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and reduce any symptoms.
Lifestyle changes
If you’re diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended.
Avoiding alcohol
The most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if it isn’t the cause of your condition. This helps to prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain.
If you continue to drink alcohol, it’s likely that you’ll experience debilitating pain and you’ll be more likely to die from a
complication of chronic pancreatitis
.
Some people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, talk to your GP about getting help to stop drinking.
Treatment options for alcohol dependence include:
one-to-one counselling
self-help groups – such as
Alcoholics Anonymous
a medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcohol
Read more about
treating alcohol misuse
.
Stopping smoking
If you smoke, you should stop. Smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function.
It’s recommended that you use an anti-smoking treatment, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion (a medication used to reduce cravings for cigarettes). People who use these types of treatments have a much greater success rate in permanently stopping smoking than those who try to quit using willpower alone.
If you want to give up smoking, it’s a good idea to start by visiting your GP. They’ll be able to give you help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking support service.
These services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. Studies show you are 4 times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the NHS.
Read more about
stopping smoking
.
Dietary changes
As chronic pancreatitis can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet.
Your GP may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan.
A low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don’t make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional.
Enzyme supplements
You may be given pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. These supplements may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system.
Side effects of pancreatic enzyme supplements can include
diarrhoea
,
constipation
, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains.
Talk to your GP if you’re experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted.
Steroid medication
If you have chronic pancreatitis caused by problems with your immune system, treatment is relatively straightforward. The inflammation affecting the pancreas can usually be relieved using steroid medication (
corticosteroids
).
However, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such as
osteoporosis
and weight gain.
Pain relief
Pain relief is an important part of the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. At first, mild painkillers will be used, but more powerful ones will be needed if these don’t work.
Mild painkillers
In most cases, the first painkiller used is
paracetamol
or a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
, such as
ibuprofen
.
Taking NSAIDs on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developing
stomach ulcers
, so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect against this.
Stronger painkillers
If NSAIDs or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it’s likely that you’ll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. Side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.
The side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. You may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation.
See the page on
treating constipation
for more information.
If you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines.
Severe pain
If you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. These have similar side effects to opiate-based painkillers.
Long-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn’t usually recommended, because there’s a high risk of addiction. Therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery is usually recommended.
In some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. Amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people.
If medication isn’t effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for a few weeks or months using a procedure called a nerve block. This is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas.
Severe episodes
If the inflammation of your pancreas suddenly gets worse, you may need a short stay in hospital for treatment.
This may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose.
Read more about
treating acute pancreatitis
.
Surgery
Surgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used.
Endoscopic surgery
Patients with stones in the opening of their pancreas (the pancreatic duct) may benefit from endoscopic surgery and a treatment called lithotripsy.
Lithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. An endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed.
This treatment may improve pain to some extent, but the benefit may not be permanent.
Pancreas resection
In cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. This type of surgery is called a pancreas resection.
Pancreas resection can also be used if endoscopic treatment is ineffective.
The technique used for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. For example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas.
The different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. Simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times.
Discuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision.
Total pancreatectomy
In the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. This is known as a total pancreatectomy.
A total pancreatectomy can be very effective in treating pain. However, you’ll no longer be able to produce the insulin that’s needed by your body. To overcome this problem, a relatively new technique called autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation (APICT) is sometimes used.
During APICT, the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed.
The islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. If the APICT procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin.
In the short term, APICT appears to be effective, but you may need additional insulin treatment in the long term. See guidelines from the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) about
autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation
for more information.
Complications of chronic pancreatitis
Complications of chronic pancreatitis are relatively common and usually caused by living with chronic pain or damage to the pancreas.
Psychological effects of chronic pancreatitis
Any chronic health condition, particularly one causing recurring or constant pain, can have an adverse effect on your emotional and psychological health. The International Association for the Study of Pain found that up to 94% of people with chronic pancreatitis experience pain.
One study of people living with chronic pancreatitis found that one in seven people had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as
stress
,
anxiety
or
depression
.
Contact your GP if you’re experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. Effective treatments are available to help improve the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.
Joining a support group for people with chronic pancreatitis may also help. Talking to other people with the same condition can often help to reduce feelings of isolation and stress.
Diabetes
Around a third of people with chronic pancreatitis develop
diabetes
, usually many years after receiving their diagnosis (it’s not unusual for 20 years to pass before diabetes occurs).
Diabetes develops when your pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin (a chemical the body uses to break glucose down into energy). The main symptoms of diabetes are:
feeling very thirsty
going to the toilet a lot, particularly at night
extreme tiredness
weight loss and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk)
If you develop diabetes because of chronic pancreatitis, you’ll probably need to have regular insulin injections to compensate for the lack of natural insulin in your body.
Pseudocysts
Another common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pseudocysts (sacs of fluid which develop on the surface of your pancreas). They’re thought to affect around 1 in 10 people with chronic pancreatitis.
In many cases, pseudocysts don’t cause any symptoms and are only detected during a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
. However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause the following symptoms:
bloating
indigestion
dull abdominal pain
If the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for treatment, because they usually disappear on their own.
Treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or the pseudocysts are larger than 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting open, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.
Pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. This can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. Alternatively, an endoscopy may be used. This is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.
Sometimes, pseudocysts are treated by removing part of the pancreas using laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. This is known as a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. See guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on
laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy
.
Pancreatic cancer
Chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of developing
pancreatic cancer
. However, the increased risk is relatively small. For example, it’s estimated that for every 100 people with chronic pancreatitis, only 1 or 2 will develop pancreatic cancer.
The most common initial symptoms of pancreatic cancer are much the same as chronic pancreatitis. They include jaundice, abdominal pain and weight loss."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/coma/,"Coma
A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken.
It can result from injury to the brain, such as a
severe head injury
or
stroke
. A coma can also be caused by severe alcohol poisoning or a brain infection (encephalitis).
People with
diabetes
could fall into a coma if their blood glucose levels suddenly became very low
(hypoglycaemia)
or very high
(hyperglycaemia)
.
What is a coma?
Someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They’re alive, but can’t be woken up and show no signs of being aware.
The person’s eyes will be closed and they’ll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won’t normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily.
Someone in a coma will also have very reduced basic reflexes such as coughing and swallowing. They may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe.
Over time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.
Caring for and monitoring a person in a coma
Doctors assess a person’s level of consciousness using a tool called the
Glasgow Coma Scale
. This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses three things:
eye opening – a score of one means no eye opening, and four means opens eyes spontaneously
verbal response to a command – a score of one means no response, and five means alert and talking
voluntary movements in response to a command – a score of one means no response, and six means obeys commands
Most people in a coma will have a total score of eight or less. A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover.
In the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after in an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and their body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated.
In the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. This can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don’t develop bedsores, and gently exercising their joints to stop them becoming tight.
What you can do as a visitor
The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don’t.
Some people have reported feeling enormous reassurance from the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma.
When visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find the advice below helpful:
when you arrive, announce who you are
talk to them about your day as you normally would – be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard
show them your love and support – even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be a great comfort
Research has also suggested that stimulating the main senses – touch, hearing, vision and smell – could potentially help a person recover from a coma.
As well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume.
Recovering from a coma
A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.
a vegetative state – where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves
a minimally conscious state – where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes
Some people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all.
People who do wake up from a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with.
Some people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need physiotherapy,
occupational therapy
and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives.
The chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they’ve been in a coma. But it’s impossible to accurately predict whether the person will eventually recover, how long the coma will last and whether they’ll have any long-term problems.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/common-heart-conditions/,"Common heart conditions
There are many different heart conditions and problems which are collectively called heart disease.
It’s always best to discuss your heart condition with your health professional or heart specialist who can advise you on the correct diagnosis and name of your condition and treatment plan.
Heart disease and different conditions affect the heart’s ability to work efficiently.
It can be worrying and confusing to be diagnosed with a heart condition, but there’s a lot of information and support available to you. Sometimes understanding what is happening can help you worry less.
Coronary heart disease
The most common heart condition in Scotland is coronary heart disease. This is caused when the heart’s blood vessels – the coronary arteries – become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply enough blood to the heart.
It can lead to angina and/or a heart attack.
Read more about coronary heart disease
Angina
Angina is a pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, stomach or jaw that happens when the blood supply to your heart becomes restricted because of your arteries becoming narrowed. This clogging is called atheroma. Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease, not an illness in itself.
Angina is your heart’s way of telling you it’s not getting enough oxygen when you’re doing something strenuous or you’re feeling under stress. Many people learn to recognise how much activity will bring on an angina attack – this is called stable angina.
If you have unexplained chest pain, seek urgent medical advice – you will need an assessment of your overall health.
Unstable angina
Unstable angina can be undiagnosed chest pain or a sudden worsening of existing angina. It happens when the blood supply to the heart is severely restricted and angina attacks occur more frequently, with less and less activity.
These attacks may even happen at rest or wake you from sleep. They can last up to 10 minutes.
You should see your doctor urgently, and you may be admitted to hospital.
Until tests confirm the diagnosis, this is sometimes called Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).
Read m
ore about
angina
Heart attack
A heart attack – also known as myocardial infarction or MI – happens when the blood supply to part of your heart muscle becomes completely blocked. This is most commonly caused by a piece of fatty material breaking off and a blood clot forms within a coronary artery. This can cause damage to the part of your heart muscle which that particular coronary artery was supplying.
Read more about the
symptoms of a heart attack
Heart failure
If the heart’s pumping action can’t work effectively, your heart muscle can’t meet your body’s demand for blood and oxygen, and your body develops various different symptoms, like fatigue and shortness of breath. This is called heart failure because of the failure of your heart to work efficiently.
Read more about
heart failure
Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms)
The heart muscle has its own electrical system which helps to stimulate the heartbeat. If the electrical signals within your heart are interrupted or disturbed, your heart can beat too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) and/or in an irregular way. This is called an arrhythmia.
Read about
arrhythmia
on the Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland website
Valve disease
The valves open and close to regulate the flow of blood through the heart. Problems with the valves can increase the workload of your heart and can put a strain on your heart muscle, leading to a range of symptoms, like:
shortness of breath
swollen ankles
fatigue
chest pain (angina or palpitations)
dizziness or fainting
Read about
heart valve problems
on the Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland website
High blood pressure
Another condition which can affect the heart is high blood pressure or hypertension. Although it’s not a disease in itself, hypertension can lead to an increased risk of developing serious conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.

Congenital heart conditions
Congenital heart conditions occur when there’s an abnormality or defect with the structure of the heart of a developing foetus while inside the mother’s womb. A baby may be born with only one defect or with several defects. Some types of congenital heart defects are life-threatening, either immediately to the newborn or over time.

congenital heart disease
Inherited heart conditions
Inherited conditions can be passed on through families. They are sometimes called familial or genetic heart conditions.
They can affect people of any age and can be life-threatening. The first sign there’s a problem is often when someone dies suddenly with no obvious cause.
These conditions are different from most congenital heart conditions, although some congenital conditions can also be inherited.

About chronic myeloid leukaemia
Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:
lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections
myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage
These pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
acute myeloid leukaemia
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
What happens in chronic leukaemia
Your bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell:
red blood cells – which carry oxygen around the body
white blood cells – which help fight infection
platelets – which help stop bleeding
In leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets.
It’s this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.
Warning signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia
In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. As the condition develops, symptoms include:
tiredness
weight loss
night sweats
a feeling of bloating
bruising
bone pain
Read more about the
symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia
How common is chronic myeloid leukaemia?
Chronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer.
Chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. There is no evidence that it runs in families.
Symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia
In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.
When symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:
tiredness
frequent infections
unexplained weight loss
a feeling of bloating
less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless
Chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.
The symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include:
severe fatigue
bone pain
night sweats
fever
easily bruised skin
Causes of chronic myeloid leukaemia
Chronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells.
The change in the DNA causes the stem cells to produce more white blood cells than are needed.
They are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like healthy ‘adult’ white blood cells.
As the number of immature cells increases, the number of healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this fall which causes many of the symptoms of chronic leukaemia.
Philadelphia chromosome
Although the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality.
Most people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of DNA from one chromosome has been swapped with a section from another.
This is called the Philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and grow and multiply far more quickly than usual.
Possible triggers for chronic leukaemia
What triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. The one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation.
However, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at Chernobyl.
Benzene
There is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the UK there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.
Benzene is also found in cigarettes. However, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor in
acute leukaemia
than it is in chronic leukaemia.
Occupational risks
A number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals.
These occupations include:
all types of agricultural workers
people who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture
tailors and dressmakers
cleaners
builder’s labourer
Other risk factors
There is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who:
are
obese
have a weakened immune system – due to
HIV or AIDS
or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant
have inflammatory bowel disease – such as
ulcerative colitis
or
Crohn’s disease
Diagnosing chronic myeloid leukaemia
Chronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition.
A
blood test
that reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. If you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing.
Bone marrow biopsy
To confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow
biopsy
. A bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a
local anaesthetic
.
The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight.
The bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. If there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present.
Further tests
There are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. These can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated.
Cytogenetic testing
Cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are a number of specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.
For example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome. People who have this chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.
The blood test is repeated every 3 months for at least 2 years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.
Imaging tests
In some cases, the hospital may want to perform some imaging tests to help rule out other conditions or confirm a diagnosis. This may be either:
an
X-ray
– usually to examine your chest
an
ultrasound scan
– usually to examine your spleen and liver
Treating chronic myeloid leukaemia
Imatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. These tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them.
The aim of treatment is to achieve the following:
by 3 months, correct the blood count
by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome (see
Causes
page for information on this)
by 18 months, get to a stage where the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission)
Chemotherapy
is usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage.
Treating early-stage chronic myeloid leukaemia
Imatinib
A medicine called imatinib is the main treatment recommended for chronic myeloid leukaemia. It is usually given as soon as a diagnosis is made because the medicine is designed to slow the progression of the cancer and to prevent the condition reaching the accelerated or advanced phase.
Imatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase (tyrosine kinase helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). This reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells.
Imatinib is taken as a tablet. The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. They include:
nausea
vomiting
swelling in the face and lower legs
muscle cramps
rash
diarrhoea
Nilotinib
It is estimated that 10 to 40% of people who take imatinib become resistant to its effects, so an alternative treatment is required.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended nilotinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. In some cases, nilotinib is recommended as the first treatment.
Nilotinib works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells.
Side effects of nilotinib can include:
vomiting
abdominal pain
bone and joint pain
dry skin
loss of appetite
hair loss
insomnia
night sweats
dizziness
tingling or numbness
If the side effects become particularly troublesome, temporarily stopping the treatment usually helps to bring them under control. Treatment can then be resumed, possibly using a lower dose of medication.

Treating advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia
Chemotherapy
Once chronic myeloid leukaemia has progressed to a more advanced stage, chemotherapy is the next treatment.
Chemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. Side effects include:
tiredness
skin rash
increased vulnerability to infection
Chemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. This is known as being immunocompromised. Read
chronic leukaemia complications
for more information about this.
If your symptoms persist or get worse, chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy) will need to be used. Intravenous chemotherapy causes more side effects than chemotherapy tablets and they tend to be more severe.
Side effects include:
nausea
vomiting
tiredness
hair loss
infertility
These side effects should resolve after your treatment has finished, although there is a risk that infertility could be permanent.
Bone marrow and stem cell transplants
A bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary for some patients.
Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.
This can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.
Due to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation.
In most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit.
However, your specific circumstances may mean that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

bone marrow transplants
Complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia
Being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia.
There are 2 reasons for this:
the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection
many of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia can weaken the immune system
This means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.
You may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections from occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.
Symptoms of infection include:
high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above
headache
aching muscles
diarrhoea
tiredness
Avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).
While it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.
Also ensure that all of your
vaccinations
are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as:
the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine
the polio vaccine
the oral typhoid vaccine
the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)
the yellow fever vaccine
Psychological effects of chronic leukaemia
Receiving a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.
The situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress,
anxiety
and
depression
.
If you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.
You may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.
Another excellent resource is
Macmillan Cancer Support
. Their helpline number is
0808 808 00 00
and is open Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/clostridium-difficile/,"Clostridium difficile
Clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea.
The infection most commonly affects people who have recently been treated with
antibiotics
, but can spread easily to others.
C. difficile infections are unpleasant and can sometimes cause serious bowel problems, but they can usually be treated with another course of antibiotics.
Symptoms of a C. difficile infection
Symptoms of a C. difficile infection usually develop when you’re taking antibiotics, or when you’ve finished taking them within the last few weeks.
The most common symptoms are:
watery
diarrhoea
, which can be bloody
painful tummy cramps
feeling sick
signs of dehydration
, such as a
dry mouth
,
headaches
and peeing less often than normal
a high temperature (fever) of above 38C (100.4F)
loss of appetite and weight loss
In some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting.
Who’s most at risk of C. difficile?
C. difficile mostly affects people who:
have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that work against several types of bacteria) or several different antibiotics at the same time, or those taking long-term antibiotics
have had to stay in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or care home, for a long time
are over 65 years old
have certain underlying conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
cancer
or
kidney disease
have a weakened immune system, which can be because of a condition such as
diabetes
or a side effect of a treatment such as
chemotherapy
or
steroid medication
are taking a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of stomach acid they produce
have had surgery on their digestive system
Many C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and care homes.
However, strict infection control measures have helped to reduce this risk, and an increasing number of C. difficile infections now occur outside these settings.
When to get medical advice
Visiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection can put others at risk, so it’s best to phone your GP or NHS 111 if you’re concerned or feel you need advice.
Phone your GP if:
you have persistent diarrhoea after finishing a course of antibiotics
you have bloody diarrhoea
you have diarrhoea and experience severe tummy pain, a high fever, a rapid heart rate or fainting
you have
symptoms of severe dehydration
, such as confusion, drowsiness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Diarrhoea can be caused by a number of conditions and is a common side effect of antibiotics, so having diarrhoea while taking antibiotics doesn’t necessarily mean you have a C. difficile infection.
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to confirm whether you have C. difficile. A
blood test
may also be carried out to help determine how severe the infection is, and sometimes you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged.
Treatment for C. difficile
Your GP will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you’re not already in hospital). If the infection is relatively mild, you may be treated at home.
If you’re in hospital, you might be moved to a room of your own during treatment to reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.
Treatment for C. difficile can include:
stopping the antibiotics thought to be causing the infection, if possible – in mild cases, this may be the only treatment that’s needed
taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill C. difficile bacteria
rarely, serious infections may require surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowel
C. difficile infections usually respond well to treatment, with most people making a full recovery in a week or two. However, the symptoms come back in around 1 in 5 cases and treatment may need to be repeated.
Looking after yourself at home
If you’re well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading.
Do
make sure you finish the entire course of any antibiotics you’re prescribed, even if you’re feeling better
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration and eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread if you feel hungry
take paracetamol for tummy pain or a fever
regularly wash your hands and contaminated surfaces, objects or sheets
stay at home until at least 48 hours after your last episode of diarrhoea
Don’t
do not take anti-diarrhoeal medication, as this can stop the infection being cleared from your body
Your GP may contact you regularly to make sure you’re getting better. Phone them if your symptoms return after treatment finishes, as it may need to be repeated.
How you get C. difficile
C. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.
However, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in the bowel, which can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply and produce toxins that make the person ill.
When this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person’s diarrhoea.
Once out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they’re thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth.
Someone with a C. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up.
How to stop C. difficile spreading
C. difficile infections can be passed on very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home and in healthcare settings.
The following measures can help:
stay at home until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up
wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet and before eating – use liquid rather than bar soap and don’t use flannels or nail brushes
clean contaminated surfaces – such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles – with a bleach-based cleaner after each use
don’t share towels and flannels
wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature
when visiting someone in hospital, observe any visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not effective against C. difficile
avoid visiting hospital if you’re feeling unwell or have recently had diarrhoea"

About cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage.
Scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.
The damage caused by cirrhosis can’t be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. This is called liver failure.
Cirrhosis can be fatal if the liver fails. However, it usually takes years for the condition to reach this stage and treatment can help slow its progression.
Each year in the UK, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need a
liver transplant
to survive.
Signs and symptoms
There are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you’re likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin.
In the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites).
Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.
When to see your GP
As cirrhosis doesn’t have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it’s often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness.
See your GP if you have any of the following symptoms:
fever and shivering
shortness of breath
vomiting blood
very dark or black, tarry stools (faeces)
periods of confusion or drowsiness
Read more about
diagnosing cirrhosis
.
What causes cirrhosis?
In the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are:
drinking too much alcohol (
alcohol misuse
) over many years
being infected with the
hepatitis C
virus for a long time
a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that causes excess fat to build up in the liver
NASH is on the rise in the UK, due to increasing levels of
obesity
and reduced physical activity. It’s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.
Less common causes of cirrhosis include
hepatitis B
infection and inherited liver diseases, such as haemochromatosis.
Read more about the
causes of cirrhosis
.
Treating cirrhosis
There’s currently no cure for cirrhosis. However, it’s possible to manage the symptoms and any complications, and slow its progression.
Treating underlying conditions that may be the cause, such as using anti-viral medication to treat a hepatitis C infection, can also stop cirrhosis getting worse.
You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you’re overweight. A wide range of
alcohol support
services are available.
In its more advanced stages, the scarring caused by cirrhosis can make your liver stop functioning. In this case, a
liver transplant
is the only treatment option.
Read more about
treating cirrhosis
.
Preventing cirrhosis
Not exceeding the
recommended limits for alcohol consumption
is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis.
Hepatitis B and C are infections you can get by having unprotected sex or sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a
condom
during sex and not injecting
drugs
will reduce your risk of developing hepatitis B and C.
A vaccine for hepatitis B is available, but there’s currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Read more about
preventing cirrhosis
.
Symptoms of cirrhosis
There are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.
In early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.
Symptoms of cirrhosis can include:
tiredness and weakness
loss of appetite
weight loss and muscle wasting
feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting
tenderness or pain around the liver area
tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level
very itchy skin
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent
nosebleeds
or bleeding gums
hair loss
fever and shivering attacks
swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)
swelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases can make you look heavily pregnant)
You may also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (
insomnia
), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.
Late-stage symptoms
In the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can’t flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).
The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.
Over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.
When to seek medical help
You should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.
Seek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you’ve been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis:
fever and shivering attacks
shortness of breath
vomiting blood
very dark or black tarry stools
periods of mental confusion or drowsiness
Causes of cirrhosis
There are many different causes of cirrhosis. In the UK, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis C infections.
In some cases, no specific cause is identified.
Alcohol consumption
The liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver’s cells. Men and women who drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much.
If you’re a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it’s important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn’t just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you’re a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis.
Alcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build.
Stages of alcoholic liver damage
People who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3 separate stages.
The first stage of
alcohol-related liver disease
is known as ‘fatty liver’, which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It’s a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less.
The second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20% to 30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death.
About 10% of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease.
This risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over 3 or more days.
A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.
Read more about
alcohol units
.
Your GP can give you help and advice if you’re finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.
Hepatitis
Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis.
In the UK,
hepatitis C
is the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs.
Two other types of hepatitis infection,
hepatitis B
and D, can also cause cirrhosis.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis.
NASH can develop in people who are obese, have
diabetes
, have high levels of fat in the blood (
high cholesterol
) and
high blood pressure
. Most people with NASH feel well and aren’t aware they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected.
NASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of
obesity
and reduced physical activity. It’s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.
Other causes
There are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include:
autoimmune liver disease – the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs
some rare, genetic conditions – such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson’s disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body)
any condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked – such as
cancer of the bile ducts
or
pancreatic cancer
Budd-Chiari syndrome – caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver
Less commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis.
Diagnosing cirrhosis
If your GP suspects cirrhosis, they’ll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease.
If your GP suspects your liver is damaged, you’ll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis.
Tests
You may have a number of different tests.
Blood tests
Blood tests
can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).
Scans
An
ultrasound scan
, transient elastography scan,
computerised tomography (CT)
scan or a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan may be carried out on your liver. A transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it’s sometimes known as a Fibroscan).
These scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring.
The
Lab Tests Online UK
website has more information about
ALT
and
AST
measurements.
Liver biopsy
A liver
biopsy
is where a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope.
The biopsy is usually carried out under
local anaesthetic
, as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. The outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause. However, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
Endoscopy
An endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach.
Images of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels), which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen.
Grading
There are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe).
An alternative system called model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify people who need an urgent liver transplant.
Treating cirrhosis
Cirrhosis can’t be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse.
It’s usually not possible to reverse liver damage that’s already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated.
Treatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts.
Stopping cirrhosis getting worse
Taking medication to treat the underlying cause of the liver damage and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems.
Medication
The medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver.
For example, if you have viral hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication (
corticosteroids
) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).
Lifestyle changes
There are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including:
completely avoid
alcohol
, regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses
lose weight
if you’re overweight or obese
regular
exercise
to reduce muscle wasting
practise good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections
speak to your GP about
vaccinations
you may need, such as the
annual flu vaccine
or travel vaccines
speak to your GP or pharmacist if you’re taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines
Malnutrition
is common in people with cirrhosis, so it’s important to ensure you have a
balanced diet
to help you get all the nutrients you need.
Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can help reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See tips for a lower salt diet for more information.
The damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra calories and protein in your diet.
Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals.
Easing symptoms
A number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including:
a low-sodium (salt) diet or tablets called diuretics to reduce the amount of fluid in your body
tablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection
creams to reduce itching
Managing complications of advanced cirrhosis
In cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may need treatment.
Swollen varices
If you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices.
In these cases, urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital immediately.
Certain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as:
banding – an endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding
injection glue therapy – following an endoscopy, a type of medical ‘super glue’ is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding
a Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end – a special tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated; this puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding and you’ll be heavily sedated during the procedure
a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) – a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join 2 large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein); this creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varices
You may also be given a type of medication called a
beta-blocker
, such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that does occur.
Fluid in the tummy and legs
Ascites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They’ll need to be addressed as soon as possible.
You may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. The main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide.
If the fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with
antibiotics
. Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis to prevent infection in people at high risk.
In severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks.
Encephalopathy
People with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn’t clearing toxins properly.
The main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. This acts as a
laxative
(it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used.
Bleeding
Cirrhosis can affect the liver’s ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself.
Vitamin K
and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. You’ll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed.
Therefore, you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work.
Liver transplant
Your liver may stop functioning if it’s severely damaged by scarring. In this situation, a
liver transplant
is the only option. This is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver.
However, you’ll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors.
The
NHSBT Organ Donation
website has more information about transplants and joining the
Organ Donor Register
.
Preventing cirrhosis
You can reduce your chances of developing cirrhosis by limiting your alcohol consumption and protecting yourself from a hepatitis infection.
Limiting your alcohol consumption
Heavy alcohol consumption is one of the most common causes of cirrhosis of the liver. One of the best ways to avoid this is to keep within recommended limits.
men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week
spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week
If you have cirrhosis, you should stop drinking alcohol immediately because it speeds up the rate at which the condition progresses, regardless of the cause.
Read more about
alcohol misuse
.
Protect yourself from hepatitis
Cirrhosis can be caused by infectious conditions, such as
hepatitis B
and C. Hepatitis B and C can be caught through having unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs.
Using a
condom
when having sex will help you avoid the risk of getting hepatitis, as will avoiding injecting drugs.
Anyone who’s at risk of getting hepatitis B, such as police officers and social care workers, can be protected by being vaccinated against the condition. However, there’s currently no vaccine for
hepatitis C
.
People born in areas of the world where hepatitis B and C are widespread, such as parts of South Asia and Africa, need to be screened for hepatitis, as early treatment can help prevent the onset of cirrhosis."

About cold sores
Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They’re caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days.
You may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may happen some time later.
Cold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip.

If you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Cold sores aren’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.
If you’ve had outbreaks of cold sores before, it’s likely that you’ll know what they are if they return.
You only need to visit your pharmacist if you’re unsure whether it’s a cold sore or if it’s severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your pharmacist if a cold sore hasn’t healed after 7 to 10 days.
What causes cold sores?
The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1.
In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be the result of having oral sex with someone who has
genital herpes
.

Herpes simplex virus
The herpes simplex virus – or ‘cold sore virus’ – is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time.
However, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight, fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period.
Some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active.
Treating cold sores
Cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.
However, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.
To be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear – when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect.
Cold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals.
Antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases.

Complications of cold sores
Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications.
Dehydration
sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.
The herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include:
skin infections – these often occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a
cut or graze
, or a skin condition such as
eczema
herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) – this causes painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers
herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids
Left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness.
It’s therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes – for example, to remove contact lenses – wash your hands thoroughly first.
In very rare cases, encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as aciclovir.
Preventing infection
It’s not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection.
Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they’re completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.
However, there’s no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore.
You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below:
avoid touching cold sores unless you’re applying cold sore cream – creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in, as this can damage your skin further
always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area
do not share cold sore creams or medication with other people as this can cause the infection to spread
do not share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery
avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed
be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with
HIV
or those having
chemotherapy
if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers – for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight
Symptoms of cold sores
You won’t usually have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus (the primary infection).
An outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).
However, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.
Herpes simplex virus primary infection
In children
Symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than 5 years old. Symptoms include:
swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth – this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis
sore throat
and swollen glands
producing more saliva than normal
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
dehydration
feeling sick (nausea)
headaches
Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to 3 weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn’t usually recur after the primary infection.
In adults
Primary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults, but the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children.
You’ll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into
ulcers
with grey or yellow centres.
If you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.
Recurrent infections (cold sores)
Recurrent infections usually last for less time and are less severe than the primary infection. The only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands.
An outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip.
If you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. They may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. Initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation.
If the cold sores are very troublesome, it’s possible to suppress them by taking an antiviral tablet called acyclovir regularly, every day for a few months. This is usually only recommended if cold sores are causing a lot of problems, and they may come back when treatment is stopped.
Most cold sores disappear within 7 to 10 days without treatment and usually heal without scarring.
Causes of cold sores
Cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).
In most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood – for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore.
The virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it’s triggered at a later date.
Cold sore triggers
Factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include:
having another infection, such as a respiratory tract infection
having a high temperature (fever)
emotional upset or psychological
stress
tiredness and fatigue
an injury to the affected area
menstruation (periods)
strong sunlight
However, in many cases there’s no obvious trigger for an outbreak.
Herpes simplex virus type 2
Occasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).
This can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who has
genital herpes
, which is usually caused by HSV-2.
In genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.
Treating cold sores
Cold sores usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. Antiviral tablets or cream can be used to ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.
If you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes:
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
avoid acidic or salty foods and eat cool, soft foods
if brushing your teeth is painful, use an antiseptic mouthwash
dab creams on to sores rather than rubbing them in
wash your hands using soap and water before and after applying cold sore creams
avoid touching your cold sores, other than to apply cream, and don’t share your cold sore cream with others
Antiviral creams and tablets
Antiviral creams such as aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as Fenistil
®
) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection if used correctly.
Cold sore creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription.
They’re only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect.
If you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores, use antiviral medication as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that indicates a cold sore is about to develop. You’ll need to apply the cream up to 5 times a day for 4 to 5 days.
Antiviral creams can only help to heal a current outbreak of cold sores. They don’t get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring.
Antiviral tablets are generally more effective than creams at treating cold sores, but are usually only prescribed for more severe cases.
Cold sore patches
Cold sore patches that contain a special gel called hydrocolloid are also available. They’re an effective treatment for skin wounds and are placed over the cold sore to hide the sore area while it heals.
Non-antiviral treatments
Several non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter from pharmacies without the need for a prescription.
These creams aren’t specifically designed to treat cold sores and won’t help them heal faster, but they may help ease any pain or irritation. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a suitable treatment for you.
Pain can also be treated with painkillers such as
ibuprofen
or
paracetamol
– both are available in liquid form for young children.
However, don’t take ibuprofen if you have
asthma
or
stomach ulcers
, or you’ve had them in the past.
Children under the age of 16 shouldn’t be given aspirin.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have cold sores and you’re pregnant.
Treating complications
If your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged – for example, if you have
HIV
or you’re having
chemotherapy
treatment – you may be at risk of developing serious complications.
For example, your risk of developing encephalitis or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased.
Speak to your GP if you’re at risk. They may prescribe antiviral tablets and refer you for specialist treatment.
The type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of your cold sore symptoms and the complication that’s causing problems.
For example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – a secondary eye infection – you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor.
Gingivostomatitis
Visit your pharmacist if you or your child develops swollen, painful gums (gingivostomatitis) as a result of the primary herpes simplex infection. They’ll be able to suggest treatments to help ease your symptoms.
If the infection is painful, your pharmacist may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat.
Brushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. Your pharmacist may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. This helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can’t brush your teeth effectively.
As with the treatment of cold sores, any pain or fever can be treated using ibuprofen or paracetamol.
In rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it’s possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. Using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this.
Dehydration
If you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Young children are particularly at risk as they may refuse to eat or drink because of the pain in their mouth.
It’s important to watch out for signs of
dehydration
, such as:
headaches
tiredness
irritability
lightheadedness
low urine output
Most cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to 3 weeks for the sores to heal completely.
Specialist treatment
If you or your child still has symptoms of gingivostomatitis after 2 weeks or the infection is severe your pharmacist may advise you to contact your GP, who may refer you for specialist treatment.
Specialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you’re pregnant or have a weakened immune system.
Visit your GP if you have a newborn baby who develops gingivostomatitis, as they may also need to be referred for specialist treatment."

About constipation
Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you’re not passing stools regularly or you’re unable to completely empty your bowel.
Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small.
The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life.

symptoms of constipation
.
What causes constipation?
It’s often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including:
not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits
ignoring the urge to pass stools
side effects of certain medications
not drinking enough fluids
anxiety
or
depression
In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation.
Read more about the
causes of constipation
.
Who’s affected
Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It’s estimated that around 1 in every 7 adults and up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any one time.
The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy.
When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Constipation treatment from your pharmacy
If you have constipation you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Constipation isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.
Also speak to your pharmacist if you think your child might be constipated.
Laxatives
are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.
You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don’t help and the problem continues, you should see your pharmacist.
However, you should see your GP for advice if:
you notice any rectal bleeding
you notice any unexplained weight loss
you have persistent tiredness
your constipation lasts longer than 14 days without improvement
Treating constipation
Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation.
This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise.
If these aren’t effective, your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels.
Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established.

Preventing constipation
Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place.
Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet.

Complications
For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop:
haemorrhoids (piles)
faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum)
bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools)
Read more about the
complications of constipation
.
Symptoms of constipation
When you’re constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual.
Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3 or 4 days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week.
If you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation.
It may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small.
Other symptoms of constipation can include:
stomach ache and cramps
feeling bloated
feeling sick
loss of appetite
Constipation in children
As well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:
loss of appetite
a lack of energy
being irritable, angry or unhappy
foul-smelling wind and stools
stomach pain and discomfort
soiling their clothes
generally feeling unwell
Causes of constipation
Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry.
Most cases of constipation aren’t caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including:
not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits
having limited privacy when using the toilet
ignoring the urge to pass stools
immobility or lack of exercise
not drinking enough fluids
having a high temperature (fever)
being underweight or overweight
anxiety
or
depression
psychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma
Medication
Constipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you’re taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include:
aluminium antacids (medicine to treat
indigestion
)
antidepressants
antiepileptics (medicine to treat
epilepsy
)
antipsychotics (medicine to treat
schizophrenia
and other mental health conditions)
calcium supplements
opiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine
diuretics (water tablets)
iron supplements
If constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn’t stop taking any prescribed medication unless your GP advises you to.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have constipation that’s caused by a medicine. They may be able to advise you on how to treat the problem, or they might recommend you see your GP for an alternative medicine if appropriate.
Pregnancy
About 2 in every 5 women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages.
Constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant.
The bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along.
If you’re pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about
treating constipation
.
Other conditions
In rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
diabetes
hypercalcaemia – where there’s too much calcium in the bloodstream
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting
multiple sclerosis
– a condition that affects the nervous system
Parkinson’s disease
– where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting the co-ordination of body movements
spinal cord injury
anal fissure – a small tear or ulcer in the skin just inside the anus
inflammatory bowel disease – a condition that causes the intestines to become inflamed (irritated and swollen)
bowel cancer
Babies and children
Constipation in babies and children is quite common. It’s estimated that up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training can all be responsible.
Poor diet
Children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don’t get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it’s very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet.
Toilet training
It’s important that you don’t make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It’s also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they’re using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation.
Toilet habits
Some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a
phobia
about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school.
This fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse.
Other conditions
In rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:
Hirschsprung’s disease – which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools
anorectal malformation – where the baby’s anus and rectum don’t form properly
spinal cord abnormalities – including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy
cystic fibrosis
– a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to constipation
Diagnosing constipation
Constipation is a very common condition. Your pharmacist won’t usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history.
Your pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Don’t feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. It’s important they’re aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis.
Your pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines.
Constipation can be defined in a number of ways:
opening the bowels less than 3 times a week
needing to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions
passing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasions
Physical examination
If your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your GP for a physical examination. Read
complications of constipation
for more information about faecal impaction.
A typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You’ll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected.
An internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. Instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child’s tummy.
Further tests
If you’re experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as
blood tests
or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions.
Other tests you may have include:
an abdominal
X-ray
– where X-ray radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen
transit study examination – where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on X-rays; one or more X-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system
anorectal manometry – where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working
As there’s an increased risk of
bowel cancer
in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including
a computerised tomography (CT) scan
or colonoscopy.
Treating constipation
Treatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you’ve had it and how severe your symptoms are.
In many cases, it’s possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes.
Lifestyle advice
Changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases, this will improve the condition without the need for medication.
Some self-help methods of treating constipation are:
increase your daily intake of
fibre
(you should eat at least 18 to 30g of fibre a day)
add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet to help make your stools softer and easier to pass
avoid
dehydration
by drinking plenty of water
exercise more regularly – for example, by going for a daily
walk
or
run
if constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as
paracetamol
– always follow the dosage instructions carefully; children under 16 shouldn’t take
aspirin
keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you’re able to spend time on the toilet and respond to your bowel’s natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don’t delay
try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier
if medication you’re taking could be causing constipation, your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative
Read about
preventing constipation
for more ways to change your diet and lifestyle.
Your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don’t help.
Laxatives
Laxatives
are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.
Bulk-forming laxatives
Your pharmacist will usually start you on a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass.
Commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk, methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don’t take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative.
Osmotic laxatives
If your stools remain hard after you’ve taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them.
Commonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect of the laxative.
Stimulant laxatives
If your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus.
The most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours.
According to your individual preference and how quickly you need relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives.
How long will I need to take laxatives for?
If you’ve had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed.
However, if your constipation is caused by an underlying medical condition or a medicine you’re taking, your GP may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or even years.
If you’ve been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you’ll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months.
Your GP will advise you about when it’s best to stop taking long-term laxatives.
Treating faecal impaction
Faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along.
Sometimes as a result of impaction, overflow
diarrhoea
may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this.
If you have faecal impaction, you’ll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative.
If you don’t respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the following medications.
Suppository – this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. The suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form.
Mini enema – where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. Docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way.
Pregnancy or breastfeeding
If you’re pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You’ll also be advised to do gentle exercise.
If dietary and lifestyle changes don’t work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly.
Lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren’t absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won’t feel the effects of the laxative.
Laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don’t work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives).
However, senna may not be suitable if you’re in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it’s partially absorbed by your digestive system.

Babies who haven’t been weaned
If your baby is constipated but hasn’t started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you’re using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don’t dilute the mixture.
You may want to try gently moving your baby’s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.
Babies who are eating solids
If your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be puréed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are:
apples
apricots
grapes
peaches
pears
plums
prunes
raspberries
strawberries
Never force your baby to eat food if they don’t want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience.
If your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren’t suitable for babies, so they’ll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn’t work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative.
Children
For children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary.
As well as eating fruit, older children should have a
healthy, balanced diet
, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta.
Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or using the toilet. It’s important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they’ve passed as many stools as possible.
To encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child’s bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.
Complications of constipation
Constipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. Treatment is usually effective, particularly if it’s started promptly.
However, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications.
Rectal bleeding
Continually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding.
In some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it’s more often caused by
haemorrhoids (piles)
. Piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus.
As well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus.
The
symptoms of piles
often settle down after a few days without treatment. However, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort.
See your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding.
Faecal impaction
Long-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus.
Once you have faecal impaction, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get rid of the stools naturally.
Faecal impaction makes constipation worse because it’s harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed.
Faecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including:
swelling of the rectum
a loss of sensation in and around your anus
bowel incontinence
bleeding from your anus
rectal
prolapse
– where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur as a result of repeated straining in people with chronic constipation)
Faecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used.
Preventing constipation
There are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.
Fibre
Including enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don’t eat enough fibre.
You should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more:
fruit and vegetables
wholegrain rice
wholewheat pasta
wholemeal bread
seeds and oats
Eating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer.
It’s important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind (
flatulence
) and experience stomach cramps.
Read more about how to increase your intake of fibre and
eating a healthy, balanced diet
.
Fluids
Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it’s hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.
Toilet habits
Never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation.
When going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.
Exercise
Keeping active and mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.
As well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.

Complications of coeliac disease
About coeliac disease
Coeliac disease is a common autoimmune condition where the immune system in a person’s intestine (gut) reacts when they eat gluten. This causes chronic inflammation.
What is gluten?
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.
Gluten is found in food and drink that contains wheat, barley and rye, such as:
most types of bread
pasta
cakes
biscuits
crackers
many breakfast cereals
pastry
certain types of sauces
some types of ready meals
most beers and lagers
certain fruit squashes
How many people have coeliac disease?
Coeliac disease affects 1 person in every 100. Only about one third of them are ever diagnosed.
Coeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age.
Reported cases of coeliac disease are twice as high in women than men.
Symptoms
Coeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body.
Symptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years.
More about the
symptoms of coeliac disease
or
what is coeliac disease?
Causes
Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It’s unknown exactly why people develop the condition.
More about the
causes of coeliac disease
Diagnosis
Most people with coeliac disease have antibodies in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis is a simple blood test. The second stage might result in a biopsy, if necessary.
More about
how coeliac disease is diagnosed
Treatment
Coeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet. By adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, you can manage your condition and improve your quality of life.
More about
how coeliac disease is treated
Complications
If coeliac disease isn’t treated, you’re at greater risk of conditions like osteoporosis and cancer in later life.
More about the
complications of coeliac disease
Living well with coeliac disease
Living with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it’s completely manageable.
Symptoms of coeliac disease
Symptoms of coeliac disease vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe.
Some people may have no symptoms at all.
Sometimes the symptoms of coeliac disease are mistaken for:
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
wheat intolerance
stress
just getting older
Common symptoms
Some common symptoms of coeliac disease include:
severe diarrhoea, excessive wind and/or constipation
persistent or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting
recurrent stomach pain, cramping or bloating
iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency
anaemia
tiredness
sudden or unexpected weight loss (but not in all cases)
mouth ulcers
skin rash (
dermatitis herpetiformis
)
depression
repeated miscarriages
neurological (nerve) problems such as ataxia (loss of coordination, poor balance) and peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the hands and feet)
If you’ve any of these symptoms, speak to your GP. You must continue eating gluten as part of your diet until you’ve been diagnosed.
You can also take Coeliac UK’s
online assessment
.
Symptoms in children
Children with coeliac disease might also not grow at the expected rate, or be late to reach puberty.
Causes of coeliac disease
It’s not known exactly why people develop coeliac disease or why some have mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms. It could be that a person’s genetics and the environment play a part in why this condition develops.
Pre-exisiting conditions
Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions – such as type 1 diabetes, Down’s syndrome or autoimmune thyroid disease. Also, in close family members (parents or siblings) of people with coeliac disease.
Genetics
Coeliac disease often runs in families. If you’ve a close relative with the condition – such as a parent or sibling – your chance of developing it is higher.
This risk is approximately 10% for those with a family history, compared with 1% for someone without a close relative with the condition. If you have a close relative with coeliac disease and you have symptoms you should speak to your GP.
If you’ve an identical twin with coeliac disease, there’s an 85% chance you’ll also develop the condition.
Diagnosing coeliac disease
Coeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age, and both children and adults can show symptoms
Delayed diagnosis is common. It can take an average of 13 years to diagnose.
Blood tests
Most people with coeliac disease have antibodies that show up in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis can be a
blood test.
Who’ll have a blood test
A blood test should be offered if you’ve any of the following:
type 1 diabetes
autoimmune thyroid disease
dermatitis herpetiformis
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
anaemia without an obvious cause
certain symptoms related to your digestive system – such as frequent diarrhoea, abdominal pain or vomiting, nausea or sudden weight loss
close relatives (parents, siblings or children) with coeliac disease
A blood test might also be offered if:
you feel tired all the time
a child is not growing as fast as expected
you’ve other symptoms or conditions that sometimes occur in people with coeliac disease – such as mouth ulcers, particular types of problems with your bones or liver, Down’s syndrome, Turner syndrome or persistent constipation
Blood tests for coeliac disease are not recommended for infants who’ve not started to eat foods containing gluten.
Before a blood test
Before a blood test is taken, it’s important that you eat gluten-containing foods in more than one meal every day for at least 6 weeks before the test.
Remember to eat a normal gluten diet for 6 weeks before any tests. This means eating more than one meal a day that includes gluten-based foods.
What’s involved in a blood test?
A blood test for coeliac disease involves taking a blood sample and testing it for antibodies in the blood.
You must have been eating gluten-containing food in more than 1 meal for at least 6 weeks before the test, for it to be successful.
Blood tests are 95% accurate at diagnosing coeliac disease.
Positive result
If the coeliac antibodies are found in your blood, further investigation will be needed. This’ll be discussed with you.
Your GP will refer you to your local coeliac service for confirmation of the diagnosis. You should remain on a normal diet until all investigations are complete.
Negative result
It’s sometimes possible to have coeliac disease and not have antibodies in your blood.
If you continue to have coeliac disease-like symptoms your GP may still refer you for a biopsy of your gut.
Biopsy
A biopsy can help confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease.
If you’re referred for a biopsy, this will be carried out in hospital. Usually, a biopsy will be done by a gastroenterologist. This is a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the stomach and intestines.
What’s involved in a biopsy?
If you need to have a biopsy, a thin flexible tube with a light called an endoscope will be inserted into your mouth or nose and passed down to your small intestine.
Before the procedure, a local anaesthetic is given to numb the throat and/or a sedative to help you relax.
During the procedure, the endoscopist will pass a tiny biopsy tool through the endoscope to take samples of the lining of your small intestine. The sample will then be examined under a microscope for signs of coeliac disease.
For those under 16 years the endoscopy would be under an anaesthetic.
Diet before and after testing
You should continue to eat gluten-containing foods every day until a diagnosis has been confirmed.
A biopsy will only show coeliac disease if the person being tested has been eating gluten-containing foods regularly.
Only after coeliac disease is confirmed can you start a gluten-free diet.
If you’re already on a gluten-free diet and find it hard to eat gluten again, your GP should refer you to a specialist. You may not be able to get gluten-free foods on prescription if you do not have coeliac disease confirmed by a biopsy.

Lynsey’s diagnosis story
Tests after diagnosis
If you’ve been diagnosed with coeliac disease, you may also have other tests to assess how the condition has affected you so far.
Additional blood tests
You may have further blood tests to check levels of iron and other vitamins and minerals in your blood. This’ll help check for
anaemia
.
Dual energy X-ray (DEXA) scan (adults only)
In coeliac disease, a lack of nutrients caused by poor absorption can make bones weak and brittle (osteoporosis).
A DEXA scan is a type of very low dose X-ray that measures bone density. This may be required if your risk score (FRAX/Qfracture) is high. This will be calculated as part of your assessment.
Over-the-counter tests
You can buy over-the-counter tests for coeliac disease at pharmacies. There isn’t enough evidence that these tests are reliable.
If you’ve used one, it’s important that you talk to your GP about the result.
Before a diagnosis can be confirmed, you’ll still need to have a blood test and biopsy.
Treating coeliac disease
The only treatment for confirmed coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet.
How does a gluten-free diet help?
Following a gluten-free diet helps prevent gluten damaging the lining of the intestines (gut). This will improve or remove the symptoms.
A gluten-free diet will also help to prevent the complications later in life.
What if I continue to eat gluten?
If you’re diagnosed with coeliac disease and continue to eat foods that contain gluten, your symptoms will return and could cause long-term damage to your health.
Gluten-free food on prescription
If you’ve a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, you can access gluten-free foods on prescription through your GP or Scottish Gluten-free Food Service.
How to register with the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service​
How long does treatment take to work?
Symptoms should improve within weeks of starting a gluten-free diet. However, it may take up to 2 years for the digestive system to heal completely.
Dietary advice
After a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease, you’ll be seen by a dietitian for help with adjusting to your new gluten-free diet and lifestyle.
The dietitian will help by:
making sure the diet is balanced and contains all the nutrients you need
advising how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to ensure it’s gluten-free
The dietitian should provide you with:
guidance on gluten-free food alternatives
information on shopping, preparing, cooking and storing gluten-free foods
information about gluten-free prescriptions and the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service
details of local and national support groups
More about a
dietitian’s perspective
Dietary supplements
As well as adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, your GP or dietitian might also recommend that you take vitamin and mineral supplements for at least the first 6 months after diagnosis. This will ensure that the you get all the nutrients you need while your digestive system repairs itself.
Taking supplements can also help correct any deficiencies, such as anaemia (a lack of iron in the blood).
Feeding your baby
If you’ve coeliac disease, you shouldn’t introduce gluten into your baby’s diet before it’s 6 months old. Breast milk is naturally gluten-free and all infant milk formulas are too.
Foods with gluten should be introduced slowly when a child is around 6 months old. The situation should be carefully monitored.
Vaccinations
If you have coeliac disease, you should get vaccinations for:
pneumococcus
flu (annually)
You should discuss this with your GP or specialist before having any vaccinations.
Annual health checks
After starting treatment, you’ll need to have an annual coeliac disease health check to monitor your condition. This will be done by your GP, a dietitian or a pharmacist.
At this health check, they’ll ask you:
about your health in relation to coeliac disease
how you’re managing your gluten-free diet
You’ll also be given the chance to discuss any concerns. Living with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it’s completely manageable.
More about
living well with coeliac disease
Complications of coeliac disease
Complications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people that continue to eat gluten, or in people that have taken a long time to diagnose.
Possible complications of coeliac disease include:
lactose intolerance
nutritional deficiencies
osteoporosis
cancer
Lactose intolerance
If you’ve coeliac disease, you may also develop lactose intolerance because the body lacks the enzyme to digest milk sugar (lactose) found in dairy products.
Lactose intolerance is only temporary. It normally disappears when you follow a gluten-free diet.
More about
lactose intolerance
Nutritional deficiencies
Severe symptoms of coeliac disease can lead to malnutrition. However, this is rare.
More common is malabsorption where your body fails to absorb nutrients from the foods you eat. This can lead to anaemia if the body doesn’t take in enough iron, and osteoporosis if there’s not enough calcium and vitamin D being taken in.
More about
nutritional deficiencies
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis causes the bones to become brittle, weak and fracture more easily. Bones need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals to stay dense and strong.
If you’ve coeliac disease, you’ve an increased risk of developing osteoporosis due to the damaged gut failing to absorb key bone nutrients from food. This decreases blood vitamin and mineral levels and the body compensates for this by taking nutrients like calcium from the bones. This weakens your bones and puts you at increased risk of fracture.
If you have coeliac disease, you should make sure you’re eating enough calcium and take vitamin D supplements.
Read further information:
NHS inform: Vitamin D
NHS inform: osteoporosis
Cancer
Having undiagnosed or untreated coeliac disease can increase your risk of developing lymphoma and some types of bowel cancer but these are rare. Risks are reduced by following a gluten-free diet.
Less common complications
Less common complications of coeliac disease include low birth weight in newborn babies and in rare cases, hyposplenia."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19/,"Coronavirus (COVID-19)
British Sign Language (BSL)
Coronavirus, and other respiratory infections such as flu, can spread easily and cause serious illness in some people. Vaccinations are very effective at preventing serious illness from coronavirus. But there’s still a chance you might catch coronavirus, or another respiratory infection, and pass it on to other people.
Most people no longer need to take a coronavirus test. To prevent the spread of infection, you should try to stay at home if you’re unwell. You can still access testing if you have a health condition which means
you’re eligible for coronavirus treatments
.
Symptoms
To prevent the spread of coronavirus, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coronavirus and you:
have a high temperature or
do not feel well enough to go to work or carry out normal activities
Try to do this until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you feel better.
Symptoms of coronavirus include:
continuous cough
high temperature, fever or chills
loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell
shortness of breath
unexplained tiredness, lack of energy
muscle aches or pains that are not due to exercise
not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry
headache that’s unusual or longer lasting than usual
sore throat, stuffy or runny nose
diarrhoea
feeling sick or being sick
How to help your symptoms
Do
drink fluids like water to keep yourself hydrated
get plenty of rest
wear loose, comfortable clothing – don’t try to make yourself too cold
take over-the-counter medications like paracetamol – always follow the manufacturer’s instructions
Antibiotics will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
You might continue to have a
cough
or feel tired after your other symptoms have improved. This does not mean that you’re still infectious.
Phone 999 or to go A&E if:
You or your child:
seems very unwell, is getting worse or you think there’s something seriously wrong – children and babies in particular can get unwell very quickly
gets sudden chest pain
is so breathless they’re unable to say short sentences when resting, or breathing suddenly gets worse – in babies their stomach may suck under their ribs
starts coughing up blood
collapses, faints, or has a seizure or fit for the first time
has a rash that does not fade when you roll a glass over it, the same as
meningitis
Speak to your GP if:
your symptoms worsen
you’re concerned about your symptoms
you have symptoms that you can no longer manage at home
you’re worried about your child, especially if they’re under 2 years
If your GP is closed, phone 111. In an emergency phone 999.
It’s particularly important to get help if you’re at increased risk of becoming more unwell from coronavirus such as if you’re pregnant, aged 60 or over, or have a weakened immune system.
Stay at home advice
There are things you can do to reduce the spread of infection if you have symptoms, have tested positive, or are a close contact.
If you aren’t eligible for testing and you have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coronavirus and have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to go to work or carry out normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Try to do this until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you feel better.
If you have a positive coronavirus test result, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 5 days after the day you took your test, or from the day your symptoms started (whichever was earlier). You should count the day after you took the test as day 1.
If a child or young person aged 18 or under has a positive coronavirus test result, they should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 3 days after the day they took the test or from the day their symptoms started (whichever was earliest), if they can. Children and young people tend to be infectious for less time than adults.
If you’ve had a positive test result, and have completed 5 days of self-isolation
Although many people will no longer be infectious to others after 5 days, some people may be infectious to other people for up to 10 days from the start of their infection.
If you have a high temperature or still feel unwell after the 5 days, continue to try to stay at home. Try to stay at home until you:
feel well enough to go back to normal activities
no longer have a high temperature (if you had one)
This will help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.
You should avoid meeting people at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from coronavirus, especially
those whose immune system means that they are at higher risk of serious illness from coronavirus
for 10 days after the day you took your test.
If you’ve received a positive test result and have been following the stay at home advice, you do not need to test after the 5 day period unless you’ve been advised to do so by a health professional.
How to reduce the spread of infection
Do
work from home if you can – if you can’t, talk to your employer about your options
if you’ve been asked to attend a medical or dental appointment in person, tell them about your symptoms or positive test
ask friends, family or neighbours to get food and other essentials for you, if you wish
tell people you have recently been in contact with that you’re feeling unwell or have tested positive so they can be aware of symptoms
keep your distance from the people you live with if you can
ventilate rooms you have been in by opening windows and leaving them open for at least 10 minutes after you have left the room
wear a well-fitting face covering made with multiple layers or a surgical face mask if you do leave home or in shared areas in your home, especially if you live with someone with a weakened immune system
regularly clean frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles and remote controls, and shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms
if you do leave home, exercise outdoors in places where you will not have close contact with other people
cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
wash your hands regularly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, and before you eat or handle food
tell anyone who needs to come into your home that you have symptoms or have tested positive so they can protect themselves
Don’t
do not have close contact with anyone who is at higher risk, especially individuals with a weakened immune system, if you can avoid it
do not go to crowded places or anywhere that is enclosed or poorly ventilated if you do leave home
do not touch your face with unwashed hands, if you can avoid it
Children and young people aged 18 and under
Respiratory infections are common in children and young people, particularly during the winter months. Symptoms can be caused by several respiratory infections including the common cold, coronavirus and RSV.
For most children and young people, these illnesses will not be serious. They’ll soon recover following rest and plenty of fluids.
Very few children and young people with respiratory infections become seriously unwell.
When to stay at home
Children and young people with mild symptoms who are otherwise well, can continue to attend their education setting. Mild symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, or slight cough.
Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should stay at home and avoid contact with other people, where they can. They can go back to school, college or childcare, and resume normal activities when they no longer have a high temperature and they’re well enough to attend.
It’s not recommended that children and young people are tested for coronavirus unless advised to by a healthcare professional.
Children and young people who usually go to school, college or childcare and who live with someone who has a positive coronavirus test result should continue to attend as normal.

Complications of congenital heart disease
About congenital heart disease
Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart.
Types of congenital heart disease
There are over 30 different types of heart defect.
The two main types of congenital heart disease are:
cyanotic heart disease
acyanotic heart disease
Cyanotic heart disease
Cyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn’t enough oxygen present in the blood.
Babies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen.
They may also experience symptoms of:
breathlessness
chest pain
palpitations
fainting
fatigue
Acyanotic heart disease
Acyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it’s pumped abnormally around the body.
Babies born with acyanotic heart disease may not have any apparent symptoms but, over time, the condition can cause health problems.
In this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body.
In addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. This is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as:
breathlessness
fatigue
dizziness
fainting
How common is congenital heart disease?
Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition.
Some babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood.
Congenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as
Down’s syndrome
.
An infection during pregnancy, such as rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease.
However, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause.
Outlook for congenital heart disease
The outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect.
Research into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.
This poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.
Congenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as ‘grown-up congenital heart disease’ (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).
Congenital and rare condition register
Babies with congenital heart disease are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.
The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.
It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.
Further information about CARDRISS
Symptoms of congenital heart disease
As stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are:
cyanotic heart disease
acyanotic heart disease
Symptoms of cyanotic heart disease
The symptoms of cyanotic heart disease include:
a blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis)
palpitations
fainting
fatigue
chest pains
breathing problems
Children with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia.
Sometimes, their oxygen levels can fall further and cause additional symptoms such as anxiety and confusion or disorientation.
Symptoms of acyanotic heart disease
The symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include:
severe tiredness
palpitations
chest pain
shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs)
Common symptoms of congenital heart disease
There are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease.
These include:
poor appetite and feeding difficulties
sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding
delayed growth
Children with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age.
Causes of congenital heart disease
To understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child’s heart and general health, it’s useful to first understand how a healthy heart works.
Find out how your heart works, on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Congenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart’s structure prevent it from working as it should.
As outlined in the
introduction
, the two main types of congenital heart disease are:
cyanotic heart disease
acyanotic heart disease
Find common causes of each below.
Common types of acyanotic heart disease
Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. In cases of VSD, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle.
As blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle.
The heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. The excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension).
Atrial septal defect (ASD)
Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a similar type of defect to VSD, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles.
ASD can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs.
When referring to a ‘hole in the heart’, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either VSD or ASD.
Find out more about ASD on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Pulmonary stenosis
In pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart.
Find out more about pulmonary stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Aortic stenosis
In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve.
Because the aortic valve is the main route for oxygen-rich blood to supply the body, the narrowing can lower the body’s oxygen supply, which can cause symptoms of breathlessness and dizziness.
Find out more about aortic stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA)
Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth.
When an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby’s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta.
Therefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs.
Shortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. However, in cases of PDA, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs.
This can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct.
Common types of cyanotic heart disease
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. TOF is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. Tetralogy is a Greek word that means ‘four-fold’, and Fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition.
In cases of TOF, there are four defects that affect the heart:
A hole between the left and right ventricle (Ventricular Septal Defect).
A narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis).
The muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy).
The aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta).
As a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. This leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body.
As the body’s cells and tissue are not receiving enough oxygen, the child will develop symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.

Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease.
In cases of TGA, the pulmonary artery is attached to the left side of the heart, and the aorta is attached to the right side of the heart. This leads to oxygen-low blood, which should be pumped into the lungs, being pumped around the body, causing symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.

Risk factors for congenital heart disease
In many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart.
The known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below.
Maternal diabetes
Women with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes.
It is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect.
The increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus.
Rubella
The viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy.
If a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease.
Maternal alcohol abuse
Mothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease.
Alcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult.
Genetic conditions
There are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease.
Down’s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. Down’s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of children with Down’s syndrome will have congenital heart disease.
Other genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include:
Turner syndrome
Noonan syndrome
Diagnosing congenital heart disease
An increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born.
A foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby’s heart. It should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy.
It is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography.
Postnatal diagnosis
If a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, a diagnosis can usually be made quickly and confidently due to the distinctive blue colour of their skin.
If your baby is born with acyanotic heart disease, their symptoms may not become immediately apparent for several months, or possibly years, after birth.
Possible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include:
problems feeding
slow growth
shortness of breath after exercising
tiredness after exercising
swelling of their hands, feet and ankles
You should contact your GP if your child has any of the above symptoms. Further testing can confirm or disprove a diagnosis of congenital heart disease.
Further testing
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram may be used to check your child’s heart. Sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up.
Find out more about an echocardiogram on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child’s heart. Electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ECG machine. The machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm.
Find out more about an ECG on the British Heart Foundation website
.
Chest X-ray
A chest X-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. Both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease.
Find out more about a chest x-ray on the British Heart Foundation website.
Pulse oximetry
Pulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood.
The test involves placing a special sensor on your child’s fingertip, ear or toe. The sensor sends out light waves. A computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading.
A healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. It is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value.
Cardiac catheterisation
Cardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child’s heart.
During a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child’s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. The tube is moved up into the heart, using X-rays to help guide it.
A contrast dye that shows up on X-rays can be injected into the tube. The dye can then be studied as it moves through the heart, enabling medical staff to see how well each chamber of the heart is working. Blood pressure readings in different parts of the heart can also be taken; this will help with diagnosis and treatment planning.
Cardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure.
Treating congenital heart disease
There are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. Some of these are explained below.
Catheters
A catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects.
The advantage of this type of surgery is that it’s minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery.
Open heart surgery
For more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart.
During open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child’s body (bypass machine). An incision is made in your child’s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced.
Heart transplant
In more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. In this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart.
If your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the National Transplant Database (NTD). Depending on the condition of your child’s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. Machines, such as the ventricle assist device (VAD), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body.
Priority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. If your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time.
Once a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. You may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible.
Find out more about heart transplantation on the British Heart Foundation website.
Treatment for common types of congenital heart disease
Specific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below.
Septal defects
If your child is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD), the recommended treatment will depend on the size of the defect.
If the defect is small, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended, where your child receives no immediate treatment but their health is carefully monitored. This is because 90% of small defects will close as the child grows older.
In cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. The catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect.
In cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. This involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect.
Stenosis
If your child is diagnosed with a stenosis (a narrowing one of their valves) the treatment that is recommended will depend on the extent of the stenosis and if they are symptomatic.
In mild cases, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended. Medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child’s heart and lungs.
In more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. A small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. This is known as a balloon angioplasty. Once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. Sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened.
In more serious cases of stenosis, it’s sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. Replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. Pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart.
For people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. The catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. A replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position.
Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA)
Many cases of patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication.
Two types of medication – indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen – have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for PDA.
If a PDA does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug.
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
Babies born with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who are experiencing severe symptoms of breathlessness may require emergency surgery such as a Blalock-Taussig shunt (a BT shunt).
During a BT shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. Further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. During open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened.
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born.
A surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of TGA. During an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart.
Congenital heart disease in adulthood
About 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. Living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. Some adults will require specialised care.
Routine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. There is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required.
Due to these factors, it’s recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. The clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice.
Your GP or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.
Complications of congenital heart disease
Many children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking.
Some children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance.
If your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (IEP). The IEP makes an assessment of your child’s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist.
The IEP will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. Children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided.
Endocarditis
Both children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis.
Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart.
Symptoms of endocarditis include:
fever
chills
sweating (including night sweats)
muscular aches and pains
chest pain
coughs
weakness and fatigue
headache
shortness of breath
Endocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). This will involve a hospital stay for several weeks.
Endocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart.
Due to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease.
It is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings."

Conjunctivitis (or red eye) is a common eye condition. It usually gets better in a few weeks without treatment.
Symptoms of conjunctivitis
Conjunctivitis usually causes symptoms in both eyes like:
inflammation
redness
itching
a burning or gritty feeling
watering
pus that sticks to the eyelashes
Causes of conjunctivitis
Conjunctivitis happens when the conjunctiva becomes inflamed. This is a thin layer of cells covering the front of your eyes.
The 3 most common causes of this inflammation are:
infection (infective conjunctivitis)
an allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis)
something irritating the conjunctiva, like a loose eyelash (irritant conjunctivitis)
Treating and preventing conjunctivitis
Do
boil water and let it cool down before you gently wipe your eyelashes to clean off crusts with a clean cotton wool pad (1 piece for each eye)
hold a cold towel over your eyes for a few minutes
wash your hands regularly – this is particularly important after touching your eyes
use lubricant eye drops – these are available at pharmacies or they may be prescribed for you
Don’t
do not rub your eyes
do not wear contact lenses until the symptoms have cleared up
don’t re-use old lenses after the infection has gone – they could cause re-infection
do not not share pillows or towels
You don’t need to take time off school or work if you have conjunctivitis unless you’re feeling very unwell.
Get advice from a pharmacist
Speak to a pharmacist for advice about conjunctivitis. They can suggest eyedrops or antihistamines to help with your symptoms.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Phone an optometrist urgently if you have:
pain in your eyes
sensitivity to light
changes in your vision, like wavy lines or flashing
very red eyes (1 eye or both eyes)
a baby less than 28 days old with red eyes
These can be signs of a more serious eye problem.
If your optometrist is closed phone 111.
Speak to an optometrist if:
your baby has red eyes – get an urgent appointment if your baby is less than 28 days old
you wear contact lenses and have conjunctivitis symptoms as well as spots on your eyelids – you might be allergic to the lenses
you have symptoms that haven’t cleared up after 2 weeks
Treatments for conjunctivitis
Treatment for conjunctivitis will depend on what’s causing it.
You may be prescribed antibiotics to treat a bacterial infection. But these won’t work if the symptoms are caused by a virus or an allergy.
Allergic conjunctivitis can usually be treated with antihistamines. If possible, you should also try to avoid the substance that triggered the allergy.
Irritant conjunctivitis will ease when whatever is causing the symptoms is removed.
Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause conjunctivitis. This type takes longer to get better.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/common-cold/,"Common cold
A cold is a very common mild viral infection. You can often treat a cold without seeing a GP. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks.
There is a separate page on

Symptoms of a cold
The main symptoms of a cold include:
a
sore throat
a blocked or runny nose
sneezing
a
cough
a hoarse voice
generally feeling unwell
Less common symptoms of a cold include:
high temperature (fever) – this is usually about 37°C to 39°C (98.6°F to 102.2°F)
a
headache
earache
– severe earache may be a sign of a
middle ear infection
muscle aches
loss of taste and smell
mild irritation of your eyes
a feeling of pressure in your ears and face
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
your symptoms do not improve after 3 weeks
your symptoms get suddenly worse
your temperature is very high or you feel hot and shivery
you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms
you’re feeling short of breath or develop chest pain
you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition
you have a weakened immune system – for example, because you’re having chemotherapy
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Speak to a pharmacist if you have a cold and would like advice and treatment.
Find your local pharmacy
Treatment for a cold
There’s no cure for a cold, but there are things you can do to look after yourself at home. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
Do
rest
drink plenty of fluids
eat healthily
take over-the-counter pain relief, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
, to relieve high temperature and aches
use
decongestant
sprays or tablets to relieve a blocked nose
try remedies such as gargling salt water and sucking on menthol sweets
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child,
speak to a pharmacist
for advice.
Be careful not to use cough and cold medicines if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets. Cough and cold medicines often also contain paracetamol and ibuprofen so it can be easy to take more than the recommended dose.
How do colds spread?
A person can start spreading a cold from a few days before their symptoms start until their symptoms have gone.
You can catch the virus from an infectious person by:
touching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes
touching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes
breathing in tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus – these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes
Different viruses can cause a cold. It’s possible to have different colds one after the other, as each one may be caused by a different virus.
How to prevent a cold from spreading
Do
wash your hands often, especially before touching your nose or mouth and before handling food
always sneeze and cough into tissues
throw away used tissues straight away and wash your hands
clean surfaces regularly
use your own cup, plates, cutlery and kitchen utensils
do not share towels or toys with someone who has a cold
Is it a cold or flu?
It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a cold or flu, as the symptoms can be similar. The main differences are that flu symptoms:
come on quickly
usually include a headache, high temperature (fever) and sore muscles
make you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities
Cold symptoms:
come on slowly
mainly affect your nose and throat
are fairly mild, so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work

About deafblindness
Deafblindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person’s ability to communicate, access information and get around.
It’s also sometimes called ‘dual sensory loss’ or ‘multi-sensory impairment’.
A deafblind person won’t usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life.
These problems can occur even if hearing loss and vision loss are mild, as the 2 senses work together and 1 would usually help compensate for loss of the other.
Signs of deafblindness
Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children.
In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first.
Signs of a problem can include:
needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio
difficulty following a conversation
not hearing noises such as a knock at the door
asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly
needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television
difficulty moving around unfamiliar places
If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it’s important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too.
Read more about the
symptoms of deafblindness
Seeing your GP
Visit your GP if you think your hearing and/or eyesight may be getting worse.
If you’re worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP.
It’s best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness can be more effective if started early. Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner.
Read more about
diagnosing and assessing deafblindness
What causes deafblindness?
There are many potential causes of deafblindness. Some babies are born deafblind, but in many cases the hearing and/or vision loss occurs later in life.
Causes of deafblindness include:
age-related hearing loss
genetic conditions, such as Usher syndrome
an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles)
cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination
eye problems associated with increasing age, such as cataracts
Read more about the
causes of deafblindness
Living with deafblindness
A range of care and support services is available to help deafblind people.
Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they’ll have their own individual care needs.
The general aims of care for a deafblind person are to:
preserve and maximise any remaining sight or hearing the person has – this could involve treating underlying conditions like cataracts, wearing glasses or using a hearing aid
teach alternative methods of communication – such as hand on hand signing or braille
help retain or develop as much independence as possible – for example, by training the person to use a long cane, a guide dog or offering a communicator guide
Your local authority should arrange an assessment to determine exactly what care and support is needed.

Signs and symptoms of deafblindness
A person who’s deafblind won’t usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause difficulties with everyday activities.
The hearing and/or vision problems may be present from birth, but in many cases one or both problems develop gradually as a person gets older and they may not notice it themselves at first.
If someone you know has a combination of the signs mentioned below, it’s possible they have some degree of deafblindness and should seek medical advice.
Signs of a hearing problem
Hearing loss can occur from birth or may develop gradually or suddenly later on.
Signs that someone may have a problem with their hearing include:
not hearing you if you speak to them from behind
needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio
difficulty following a conversation – particularly if several people are speaking or the person they’re speaking to is unfamiliar
not hearing noises around them, such as a knock at the door or the doorbell ringing
asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly
leaning in very close to hear what’s being said
If someone already has a hearing problem – for example, they wear a hearing aid or use sign language – keep an eye out for signs of vision problems that could develop (see below).
Signs of a vision problem
Vision loss can also be present from birth or develop later on.
Signs that someone may have a problem with their vision include:
problems seeing in low light or bright light
difficulty recognising people they know
finding it hard to read facial expressions
relying on touch to find and identify items more than usual
needing to hold books or newspapers close to their face, or sitting near the television
difficulty moving around unfamiliar places – they may bump into or trip over things regularly
not looking directly at you or making proper eye contact
If a person already has a problem with their vision – for example, they wear glasses, use a cane to get around, or have a condition such as glaucoma or cataracts – keep an eye out for signs of hearing problems that could develop (see above).
Getting medical advice
Visit your GP if you notice any deterioration in your hearing or eyesight.
If you’re worried about a friend or family member’s vision and hearing, encourage them to speak to their GP.
It’s best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness can be more effective if started early.
Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner, and enable them to plan for the future (such as learning new communication methods).

Causes of deafblindness
There are many possible causes of deafblindness. The condition can either be present at birth or develop later in life.
Deafblindness from birth
Deafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness.
It can be caused by:
problems associated with premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy)
an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles), toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV)
genetic conditions, such as
CHARGE syndrome
or
Down’s syndrome
cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination
foetal alcohol syndrome
– health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy
Deafblindness later in life
In most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness.
A person with acquired deafblindness may be born without a hearing or sight problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem, and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on.
Problems that can contribute to acquired deafblindness include:
age-related
hearing loss
Usher syndrome
– a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance
eye problems associated with increasing age, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts and glaucoma
diabetic retinopathy – a complication of
diabetes
where the cells lining the back of the eye are damaged by high blood sugar levels
damage to the brain, such as from
meningitis
, encephalitis, a
stroke
or
severe head injury

further information about the causes of deafblindness
.
Diagnosing deafblindness
Deafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life.
Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child’s hearing and/or vision at any point.
If you’re worried about a family member or friend, try to encourage them to speak to their GP.
Newborn screening
If your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during
newborn screening
.
These are a series of checks carried out to see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing.
If no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.
Hearing and vision tests for adults
In most cases, deafblindness develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.
It’s therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.
You can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.
A person may be diagnosed with deafblindness if tests show they have both hearing and vision problems.
Their hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed even after they’ve been diagnosed, as the level of care and support they need will depend on how severely each sense is affected.
Find your local optometry practice
Specialist assessment
As soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by the local authority.
The assessment should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who is able to identify the deafblind person’s abilities and needs. The assessment should include assessing their needs in relation to:
communication
one-to-one human contact
social interaction
emotional wellbeing
support with mobility
assistive technology
rehabilitation
The assessment will also take into account the person’s current needs and those that develop in the future.
A deafblind person should have access to services suitable to their level of hearing and sight and their individual needs. Mainstream services aimed mainly at blind or deaf people may not always be appropriate.
Read more about the
treatments and services available for deafblind people
.
Managing deafblindness
It’s not always possible to treat the underlying causes of deafblindness, but a range of care and support services is available to help people with the condition.
Most deafblind people will still have some hearing and/or vision. The level of care and support they need will depend on how severe their hearing and vision problems are.
Individual care plan
The individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they’re diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up.
The care plan will aim to:
preserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has
teach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet (see below)
help the person retain as much independence as possible – for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog or through the provision of a communicator guide
for young children, ensure their educational needs are met

Sense: Benefits and money
Sense: Support for disabled children and young people
Communication systems
As deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.
The main communication systems used by deafblind people include:
clear speech – speaking clearly is one of the most effective and common ways of communicating with deafblind people who have some remaining vision and hearing
deafblind manual alphabet – a tactile form of communication where words are spelt onto the deafblind person’s hand using set positions and movements
block alphabet – a simple tactile form of communication where a word is spelt out in capital letters that are drawn onto the deafblind person’s palm
hands-on signing – an adapted version of British Sign Language (BSL) where the deafblind person feels what’s being signed by placing their hands on top of the signer’s hand
visual frame signing – an adapted version of BSL where the signs are adapted to be signed in a smaller space to match the position and size of a deafblind person’s remaining sight
braille – a system that uses a series of raised dots to represent letters or groups of letters
moon – similar to Braille, but uses raised, adapted capital letters that are simpler to feel

Sense: Ways of communicating
Vision aids
For some deafblind people, it may be possible to improve vision using low vision aids, such as glasses, magnifying lenses and task lights.

Hearing aids and implants
Some deafblind people may benefit from wearing a hearing aid. There are various hearing aid styles available to suit different types of hearing loss and personal preference.
Hearing aids use microphones to collect the sound from the environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. An audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing.
For some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. In these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant.
While these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system.

One-to-one support
Every deafblind person is entitled to help from a specially trained one-to-one support worker if they need it.
Depending on the person’s situation, this may be a:
communicator guide – someone who works with people who have become deafblind later in life, to offer the support the person needs to live independently
interpreter – someone who acts as a communication link between the deafblind person and other people, using the deafblind person’s preferred method of communication
intervenor – someone who works with children and adults who were born deafblind, to help them experience and join in the world around them as much as possible
Treating underlying conditions
Some conditions that affect hearing and vision can be treated using medication or surgery. For example:
cataracts can often be treated by surgically implanting an artificial lens in the eye
glaucoma can often be treated using eye drops or laser surgery – read more about treating glaucoma
diabetic retinopathy can be treated in the early stages using laser surgery
Some causes of temporary hearing loss are also treatable, such as a
build-up of earwax
or
middle ear infections

A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It’s rarely a sign of anything serious.
Most coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don’t require any treatment.
A dry cough means it’s tickly and doesn’t produce any phlegm (thick mucus). A chesty cough means phlegm is produced to help clear your airways.

Speak to a GP if:
you’ve had a cough for more than 3 weeks
your cough is particularly severe
you cough up blood
you experience shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or chest pain
you have any other worrying symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, a persistent change in your voice, or lumps or swellings in your neck
If your GP is unsure what’s causing your cough, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for an assessment. They may also request some tests, such as a chest
X-ray
, allergy tests, breathing tests, and an analysis of a sample of your phlegm to check for infection.

Short-term coughs
Common causes of a short-term cough include:
an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that affects the throat, windpipe or sinuses – examples are a
cold
,
flu
,
laryngitis
,
sinusitis
or
whooping cough
a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) that affects your lungs or lower airways – examples are acute
bronchitis
or
pneumonia
an
allergy
, such as
allergic rhinitis
or
hay fever
a flare-up of a long-term condition such as
asthma
,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
or chronic
bronchitis
inhaled dust or smoke
coronavirus (COVID-19)
In rare cases, a short-term cough may be the first sign of a health condition that causes a persistent cough.
Persistent coughs
A persistent cough may be caused by:
a long-term respiratory tract infection, such as chronic bronchitis
asthma – this also usually causes other symptoms, such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath
an
allergy
smoking – a smoker’s cough can also be a symptom of COPD
bronchiectasis – where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened
postnasal drip – mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose, caused by a condition such as rhinitis or sinusitis
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– where the throat becomes irritated by leaking stomach acid
a prescribed medicine, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which is used to treat high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease
In most cases, a doctor won’t worry whether a cough is dry or chesty, but will need to know if you are producing much more or darker phlegm than usual.
Rarely, a persistent cough can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as
lung cancer
,
heart failure
, a pulmonary embolism (blood clot on the lung) or
tuberculosis
.
Coughs in children
Coughs in children often have similar causes to those mentioned above. For example, respiratory tract infections, asthma and GORD can all affect children.
Causes of coughs that are more common in children than adults include:
bronchiolitis – a mild respiratory tract infection that usually causes cold-like symptoms
croup – this causes a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound known as stridor when the child breathes in
whooping cough
– look out for symptoms such as intense, hacking bouts of coughing, vomiting, and a ‘whoop’ sound with each sharp intake of breath after coughing
Occasionally, a persistent cough in a child can be a sign of a serious long-term condition, such as
cystic fibrosis
.
Read more about what to do if your child has cold or flu symptoms
Cough treatments
Treatment isn’t always necessary for short-term coughs because it’s likely to be a viral infection that will get better on its own within a few weeks.
Do
rest
drink plenty of fluids
take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
Cough medicines and remedies
Although some people find them helpful, medicines that claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm are not usually recommended. This is because there’s little evidence to suggest they’re any better than simple home remedies, and they’re not suitable for everyone.
The
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
recommends that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines shouldn’t be given to children under the age of six. Children aged 6 to 12 should only use them on the advice of a pharmacist or doctor.
A homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take. Honey shouldn’t be given to babies under the age of one because of the risk of infant botulism.
Treating the underlying cause
If your cough has a specific cause, treating this may help. For example:
asthma can be treated with inhaled steroids to reduce inflammation in your airways
allergies can be treated by avoiding things you’re allergic to and taking antihistamines to dampen down your allergic reactions
bacterial infections can be treated with
antibiotics
GORD can be treated with antacids to neutralise your stomach acid and medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces
COPD can be treated with bronchodilators to widen your airways
If you smoke, quitting is also likely to help improve your cough. Read more about
stopping smoking
.
Contact your GP or, if your GP’s closed, phone 111 if your child:
is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38°C or above
is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C or above
has fewer wet nappies or nappies that seem drier than usual or has a dry nappy for over 12 hours
isn’t getting better after a few days
is taking less than half their usual amount during their last 2 or 3 feeds
If you’re very concerned about your child trust your instincts and phone your GP or 111 for advice, or phone 999 in an emergency."

About croup
Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx).
Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in.
They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.
Take your child to A&E or phone 999 if your child:
has severe breathing difficulties
has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing)
has a worsening cough or rasping sound
shows distress and agitation
has dark, blue-tinged or pale skin
the skin around their ribs and chest appears to be pulled in and tight, making the bones of their chest and ribs more visible
has abnormal drowsiness and sleepiness
has an inability to drink fluids
Contact your GP or, if your GP’s closed, phone 111 if:
is less than 3 months old and has a temperature of 38 °C or above
is aged 3 months or older and has a temperature of 39 °C or above
your child has a distinctive barking cough
your child makes a harsh sound when they breathe in
Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home.

symptoms of croup
and
diagnosing croup
Why does croup happen?
Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.
Read more about the
causes of croup
Who is affected by croup?
Croup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds.
However, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare.
The condition is more common during the late autumn and early winter months.
It tends to affect more boys than girls.
A child may experience croup more than once during childhood.
Treating croup
Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
A single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat.
If your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask.
Read more about
treating croup
Complications
Most cases of croup clear up within 48 hours. However, in some cases symptoms can last for up to two weeks.
It is extremely rare for a child to die from croup.
There are a number of conditions that can follow croup, such as
pneumonia
and
middle ear infection
.
Read more about the
complications of croup
.
Preventing croup
Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent.
Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces.
A number of your child’s routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include:
MMR
– protection from measles, mumps and rubella
DTaP/IPV/Hib
– protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b
Symptoms of croup
A child can get croup at any time of the year, although it’s more likely to occur during late autumn or early winter.
This may be because there are more viruses, such as
colds
and flu, around at this time of year.
Typical symptoms of croup include:
a bark-like cough
a hoarse or croaky voice
difficulty breathing
a harsh grating sound when breathing in, called stridor
Stridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. But in more severe cases of croup it can also occur when the child is resting or sleeping.
Symptoms tend to be worse at night.
Some children have cold-like symptoms for a few days before developing croup symptoms.
These cold-like symptoms can include:
sore throat
runny nose
cough
high temperature (fever)
Although croup symptoms usually only last for a few days, they can occasionally last up to two weeks.
When to seek medical advice
Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and mild cases can be treated at home.
Take your child to A&E or phone 999 if your child:
has severe breathing difficulties
has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing)
has a worsening cough or rasping sound
shows distress and agitation
has dark, blue-tinged or pale skin
the skin around their ribs and chest appears to be pulled in and tight, making the bones of their chest and ribs more visible
has abnormal drowsiness and sleepiness
has an inability to drink fluids
You should take them to
your nearest hospital’s accident and emergency department
or dial 999 for an ambulance.
Some of these symptoms may indicate a potentially life-threatening underlying condition called epiglottitis (inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis).
The symptoms could also indicate tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe), which also requires immediate medical attention.
Causes of croup
Croup usually develops as the result of a viral infection. The infection causes the larynx (voice box) to become swollen and the trachea (windpipe) to become blocked, and may affect the tubes in the lungs (bronchi). It is sometimes called laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis
Parainfluenza virus
The parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup. Four strains of the virus are responsible for most croup cases. These are:
parainfluenza I
parainfluenza II
parainfluenza III
parainfluenza IV
Parainfluenza I is responsible for most cases of croup.
The virus can be transmitted through close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. As with many airborne viruses, the parainfluenza virus is often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes.
Other viruses
A number of other viruses can also cause croup. These include:
influenza A and B (flu viruses)
the
measles
virus, in children who have not been immunised against measles
the rhinovirus (common cold virus)
enteroviruses
the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems and
pneumonia
in babies
Other causes
Less common causes of croup include:
inhaling a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body)
epiglottitis – inflammation of the epiglottis, (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe)
an allergic reaction to substances such as pollen or dust mites
inhalation of irritants, such as chemicals
acid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat (
acid reflux
)
Diagnosing croup
A GP can diagnose croup by studying your child’s symptoms, particularly the sound of their cough. They may also check your child’s temperature for a fever and ask whether they have recently had a cold or viral infection.
In some cases, a pulse oximetry test may be carried out. This involves clipping a sensor onto your child’s earlobe or finger to find out their oxygen levels.
The test does not hurt and should not distress your child, and determines whether your child is absorbing enough oxygen into their blood.
Your GP will decide whether your child needs to be admitted to hospital or whether their croup is safe to treat at home.
You should not try to check your child’s throat yourself, because it could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. This could cause the airway to swell even more, making breathing even more difficult.
Ruling out other conditions
Croup can usually be diagnosed by studying your child’s symptoms, but your GP may want to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
Other possible causes for your child’s symptoms are:
an abnormality of the airway, which has been present from birth
an abscess in the tissues in the back of the throat
inhaled material (something they have breathed in)
swelling of the deeper layers of the skin (angio-oedema)
epiglottitis
congenital lesion
an allergic reaction
In very rare cases, epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis) or tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe) can cause similar symptoms to croup. In these cases, however, your child will usually feel very unwell generally, rather than just having the specific symptoms of croup.
Differentiating these causes from croup may require further tests.
Further investigation
If your child is admitted to hospital with severe croup, or if treatment is unsuccessful, further investigations may be needed to examine their neck and chest area for a possible obstruction.
An X-ray may be recommended if it is thought your child may have inhaled something and it is obstructing their airway.
Treating croup
Treatment of croup depends on how severe the symptoms are. Most cases are mild and can be managed at home.
However, if your child has severe croup, they will need to be admitted to hospital urgently.
Treatment croup at home
If your GP thinks your child has mild croup, they will usually recommend managing it at home.
This will often involve using children’s
paracetamol
to ease any pain associated with the condition and may help lower your child’s temperature if they have a fever.
You should also ensure your child is well hydrated by encouraging them to drink plenty of fluids.
Comforting your child is also important because their symptoms may get worse if they are agitated or crying. If your child is distressed, sitting them upright on your lap will help to comfort and reassure them.
Your GP will usually prescribe a single dose of an oral
corticosteroid
medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone to help reduce swelling (inflammation) in your child’s throat. Side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache.
Steam treatment is not advised for the treatment of croup. There is no evidence that allowing your child to breathe in humid air, for example steam from a hot bath or shower in a closed room, will help.
You should seek urgent medical advice if you notice your child’s symptoms getting worse.
Painkillers for children
Painkillers, such as paracetamol and
ibuprofen
, are available in liquid form for children. You can get liquid paracetamol and ibuprofen over the counter from pharmacies and some supermarkets.
Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.
Speak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of painkiller is suitable for your child.
Do not use cough medicines or decongestants as these do not help ease the symptoms of croup. These treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child has breathing difficulties.
Hospital treatment
In severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be required.
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath, are a major symptom of severe croup.
You should dial 999 immediately for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.
If your child has severe croup, they may be given adrenaline through a nebuliser. This will help improve symptoms within 10 to 30 minutes and the effects should last for up to two hours. A nebuliser allows your child to breathe the medication as a mist.
If your child is very distressed and finding it difficult to breathe, they will be given oxygen through an oxygen mask.
As with milder cases of croup, oral dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually be given to help reduce any swelling in your child’s airways.
In rare cases croup may require hospitalisation, where a child may need intubation. During intubation, a tube is inserted either through a nostril or the mouth and passed down into the windpipe. This will help your child breathe more easily.
Intubation is usually performed under
general anaesthetic
. This means your child will be completely unconscious throughout the procedure so they do not experience pain or distress.
Complications of croup
Complications that develop as a result of croup are rare.
Airway obstruction
If an obstructed airway is not treated promptly, it can lead to:
severe breathing difficulty (respiratory distress)
respiratory arrest (where breathing stops but the heart continues beating)
Always phone 999 for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.
Your child may find it difficult to drink fluids as a result of an obstruction in their airway. However, it is important they have plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
.
If your child refuses fluids, try not to force them. This could distress your child and make the condition worse.
Secondary infection
A secondary infection can sometimes develop following the initial viral infection that caused croup. A secondary infection can potentially cause:
pneumonia
, a chest infection which causes swelling of the tissue in one or both lungs
bacterial tracheitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that can occur after a viral respiratory infection
Other complications
Although rare, other possible complications of croup can include
middle ear infection
and lymphadenitis, an infection of the glands of the immune system (lymph nodes)."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd/crohns-disease/,"Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.
Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage. But it mostly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).
Crohn’s disease can affect people of all ages, but it’s usually diagnosed between the age of 15 and 40.
Symptoms
The symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary. They depend on which part of the digestive system is inflamed.
Common symptoms include:
recurring
diarrhoea
abdominal pain
and cramping, which is usually worse after eating
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
unintended weight loss
blood and mucus in your poo
You may have long periods without symptoms, or very mild symptoms. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.
Less common symptoms include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100°F) or above
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
joint pain and swelling (
arthritis
)
inflammation and irritation of the eyes (uveitis)
areas of painful, red and swollen skin – most often the legs
mouth ulcers
anal pain and discharge due to perianal Crohn’s
Children with Crohn’s disease may grow at a slower rate than expected.
Speak to your GP practice if you have:
diarrhoea for more than 7 days
persistent abdominal pain
unexplained weight loss
blood in your poo
concern about your child’s development
Causes
The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown.
A combination of factors may be responsible, including:
genetics – genes you inherit from your parents
a problem with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection and illness) – where it attacks healthy bacteria in the gut and causes inflammation
environmental factors – like air pollution, medication or previous infections
smoking – smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn’s disease, and usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers
Diagnosis
Your GP will usually ask you about:
your pattern of symptoms
your diet
any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers’ diarrhoea
whether you’re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines
whether anyone else in your family has any bowel conditions
Your GP may also carry out a tests to check your general health. For example, they may:
check your pulse
check your blood pressure
measure your height and weight
measure your temperature
examine your abdomen (tummy)
Your GP may also:
arrange
blood tests
to check for inflammation, infection and
anaemia
ask for a stool (poo) sample to use a qFIT test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin test
Referral to a specialist
You may be referred to a gastroenterologist. A gastroenterologist is a specialist in conditions of the digestive system. They might recommend more tests, such as:
gastroscopy – a thin flexible tube with a camera is put into your mouth to look at your food pipe and stomach
colonoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel
sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel
a colon capsule endoscopy
(pill camera)
X-ray
or
barium enema
MRI scan
or
CT scan
You will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.
Treatment
There’s currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, but treatment can improve the symptoms and keep the inflammation under control.
Your treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.
Once your symptoms are under control, you are likely to be offered treatment to help keep them under control. If your Crohn’s stays under control for a long time, you may choose to stop treatment. You may need to start again if your symptoms come back.
Steroid medication
The first treatment offered is usually steroids, such as prednisolone or budesonide (
corticosteroids
) to reduce inflammation quickly. Steroids are often effective in reducing your symptoms. But they can have significant
side effects
. So they’re not suitable for long-term use and your dose will slowly be reduced when your symptoms start to improve.
Medicines to suppress your immune system
Medicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) may be given alongside steroids if your symptoms flare up twice or more during 12 months, or return when your steroid dose is reduced.
Common types include azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate.
Biological therapies
If steroids and immunosuppressants don’t help or aren’t right for you, biological therapies may be used.
Biological therapies block particular chemicals involved in the immune response, which helps reduce inflammation. They’re made using living cells in a lab. They can be given as a drip or an injection. Treatment usually lasts at least 12 months. Your inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) team will be able to discuss these with you.
Common types are adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab.
There’s a risk that these medicines may cause side effects, which can cause symptoms such as:
itchy skin
a high temperature
joint and muscle pain
swelling of the hands or lips
problems swallowing
You should seek immediate medical help if you experience these symptoms. Reactions can occur immediately after treatment or months later, even after treatment stops.
Surgery
Surgery to treat Crohn’s disease may be an option if:
you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects
medications don’t control your symptoms
your quality of life is severely affected by your condition
you have serious complications of Crohn’s disease
Surgery might involve widening narrow parts of your bowel, or removing parts of it (resection).
Resection involves removing the inflamed area of the intestine.
If you have a resection, you might have the healthy sections of bowel joined back together. Or you might have the end of your small bowel joined to the skin of your tummy (an
ileostomy
or stoma). In this case, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear. An ileostomy might be temporary, to give your bowel time to heal, or it might be permanent.
Your IBD team will tell you what surgery they recommend and let you know what to expect.
Diet and smoking
There is no evidence that a particular diet causes or triggers flare-ups of Crohn’s disease. But alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people.
Do
eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals
try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains
drink plenty of water
Do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need. You can speak to your IBD team about:
keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms
removing trigger foods from your diet
taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet
being referred to a dietitian
If you smoke, it is advised that you make every effort to
stop smoking
, especially if you need to have surgery.
If you smoke, smoking can make Crohn’s worse and is it important that you make every effort to
stop smoking
.
Fertility and pregnancy
A woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by Crohn’s disease.
However, surgery for Crohn’s disease might affect your fertility.
Most women with Crohn’s disease will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. But if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your IBD team. This is because they may need to change your medication.
If you’re having a flare-up of Crohn’s disease you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control.
Complications
Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system. This can result in complications such as:
narrowing of the bowel (stricture)
a channel developing between your bowel and your skin, another section of bowel or a body organ (fistula)
These problems usually need surgical treatment.
Information about you
If you have Crohn’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

About dehydration
Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in.
When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions.
Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy.
Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include:
feeling thirsty and lightheaded
a dry mouth
tiredness
having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine
passing urine less often than usual
A baby may be dehydrated if they:
have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head
have few or no tears when they cry
have fewer wet nappies
are drowsy
The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid.
Read more about the
symptoms of dehydration
What causes dehydration?
Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration.
You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever.
Read more about the
causes of dehydration
Who is at risk from dehydration?
Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include:
babies and infants – they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss
older people – they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids
people with a long-term health condition – such as
diabetes
or
alcoholism
athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods
What to do
If you’re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts.
If you’re finding it difficult to keep water down because you’re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently.
Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems.
Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child.
If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death.

When to see your GP
See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated.
If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a
blood test
or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body.
Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or
NHS 24 111
service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:
extreme thirst
feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused
not passing urine for eight hours
rapid heartbeat
dizziness when you stand up that doesn’t go away after a few seconds
You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.
Symptoms of dehydration
Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids.
Two early signs of dehydration are
thirst
and dark-coloured urine. This is the body’s way of trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss.
Other symptoms may include:
dizziness or light-headedness
headache
tiredness
dry mouth
, lips and eyes
passing small amounts of urine infrequently (less than three or four times a day)
Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina. It’s a main cause of heat exhaustion.
You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage by drinking more fluids.
If dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of
kidney stones
. It can also lead to muscle damage and
constipation
.
When to see your GP
See your GP if your symptoms continue despite drinking fluids, or if you suspect that your baby or toddler is dehydrated.
You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.
If dehydration is suspected, you may be given a
blood test
or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body.
Severe dehydration
If dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe.
Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or
NHS 24 111
service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:
feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused, and you think you may be dehydrated
dizziness when you stand up that doesn’t go away after a few seconds
not passing urine for eight hours
a weak pulse
a rapid pulse
fits (seizures)
a low level of conciousness
If severe dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to complications. This level of dehydration needs hospital treatment and you will be put on a drip to restore the substantial loss of fluids.
Dehydration in babies
A baby may be dehydrated if they have:
a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head
few or no tears when they cry
a dry mouth
fewer wet nappies
dark yellow urine
drowsiness
fast breathing
cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet

Causes of dehydration
Dehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea.
The severity of dehydration can depend on a number of factors, such as climate, level of physical activity and diet.
There are several causes of dehydration, which are described below.
Illness
Dehydration is often the result of an illness, such as
gastroenteritis
, where fluid is lost through persistent bouts of
diarrhoea
and vomiting.
Sweating
You can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions.
In these situations, it’s important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. It doesn’t necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating.
Children and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore the
symptoms of dehydration
, or not know how to recognise and treat them.
Alcohol
Dehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much
alcohol
. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more.
The headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. You should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol.
Diabetes
If you have diabetes, you’re at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. Your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently.
Read more about the different
types of diabetes
Who’s at risk?
The groups of people most at risk of dehydration are:
babies and infants – their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss
older people – they may be less aware they’re becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids
people with a long-term health condition – such as
diabetes
or alcoholism
athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods
Hyponatremia
It’s possible to become overhydrated while exercising. This is known as hyponatremia and it’s caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. It can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time.
Hyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water.
Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting and headache. In serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures, coma and, in rare cases, death.
Treating dehydration
The best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice.
A sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt.
Babies
If your baby is dehydrated, take them to see your GP as soon as possible. They’ll be able to recommend appropriate treatments, such as those outlined below.
Give your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently.
Don’t dilute your baby’s formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water.
Avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse.
Giving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ORS) in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars.
Infants and children
Infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ORS (see below).
If you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently. You may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid.

vomiting in adults
and
vomiting in children and babies
Oral rehydration solutions
When you’re dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Drinking a rehydration solution will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. The solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch.
There are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children.
Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child.
Severe dehydration
Seek immediate medical help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (see
symptoms of severe dehydration
).
They may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. In particular, babies, infants and elderly people will need urgent treatment if they become dehydrated.
Fluid may be given up the nose using a nasogastric tube or using a saline drip into a vein (intravenously). This will provide essential nutrients faster than using solutions that you drink.
If you have had bowel surgery, some rehydration solutions may not contain enough salt. In this instance, you will need a higher-strength solution. Your GP or surgeon can recommend a suitable rehydration solution for you.
Preventing dehydration
You should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.
Most of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Be guided by your thirst, but be aware that in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more.
Mild dehydration can be relieved by drinking more water and diluted fruit squash. If necessary, you can purchase oral rehydration solutions (ORS) from a pharmacy. As a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (wee) is a good sign that you’re well hydrated.
Drink regularly
If you’re active, or if the weather is particularly hot, there’s a greater risk that you will become dehydrated. To prevent becoming dehydrated, you should increase your fluid intake.
As different people sweat at different rates, it’s very difficult to provide specific recommendations about how much fluid you should drink. However, you should drink more than normal while exercising, and it’s particularly important to keep well hydrated if you’re exercising in warm conditions. This is because you will sweat more and fluid will be lost from your body more rapidly.
Rarely, drinking more fluid than your body can process can reduce the amount of sodium (salt) in your blood. This can lead to a serious and potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia. If you start to feel discomfort and bloating from drinking, stop drinking and allow time to recover.
Illness
If you, your child or someone you are caring for is ill, particularly with a fever, vomiting or
diarrhoea
, there’s a high risk of becoming dehydrated, so it’s important to start replacing fluid as soon as possible.
Advice for children
There are no specific recommendations regarding the amount of water or other fluids that children need.
However, it’s important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. Like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active.
You should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overall
healthy, balanced diet

About deep vein thrombosis
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg.
Blood clots that develop in a vein are also known as venous thrombosis.
DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can also occur in the pelvis or abdomen.
It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.
DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).
DVT symptoms
In some cases, there may be no symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include:
pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf or thigh)
a heavy ache in the affected area
warm skin in the area of the clot
red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee
DVT usually (although not always) affects one leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee.
If you think you have deep vein thrombosis ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111
Phone 999 or go to A&E if you have symptoms of DVT like:
pain and swelling of the leg, along with either breathlessness or chest pain
Pulmonary embolism
This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream. This then blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs, preventing blood from reaching them.
If left untreated, about 1 in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes:
breathlessness
– which may come on gradually or suddenly
chest pain – which may become worse when you breathe in
sudden collapse
Both DVT and pulmonary embolism need urgent investigation and treatment.
Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and develop breathlessness and chest pain.
Read more about the
complications of DVT
DVT causes
Each year, DVT affects around 1 person in every 1,000 in the UK.
Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also some other risk factors, including:
having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism
having a family history of blood clots
being inactive for long periods – such as after an operation or during a long journey
blood vessel damage – a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot
having certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal – such as cancer (including
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome
being pregnant – your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy
being overweight or
obese
The
combined contraceptive pill
and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you’re taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is slightly increased.
Read more about the
causes of DVT
Diagnosing DVT
See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have DVT – for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. They’ll ask you about your symptoms and medical history.
D-dimer test
It can be difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone. Your GP may advise that you have a specialised
blood test
called a D-dimer test.
This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein.
However, the D-dimer test isn’t always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT.
Ultrasound scan
An
ultrasound scan
can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot.
Venogram
A venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can’t confirm a diagnosis of DVT.
During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up the leg and can be detected by
X-ray
, which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood.
DVT treatment
Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines. These reduce the blood’s ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger.
Heparin and
warfarin
are 2 types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.
A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they’ve been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects.
You’ll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications.

about treating DVT
DVT prevention
If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you’re there.
If you’re at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital. These include temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you’re in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings.
When you leave hospital, your care team may also make some recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include:
not smoking
eating a healthy, balanced diet
taking regular exercise
maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you’re
obese
There’s no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT.
See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you’re at risk of getting a DVT, or if you’ve had a DVT in the past.
When taking a long-distance journey (6 hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT. Drink plenty of water, perform simple leg exercises and take regular, short walking breaks.

preventing DVT
Deep vein thrombosis causes
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) sometimes occurs for no apparent reason.
However, the risk of developing DVT is increased in certain circumstances.
Inactivity
When you’re inactive your blood tends to collect in the lower parts of your body, often in your lower legs. This is usually nothing to worry about because when you start to move, your blood flow increases and moves evenly around your body.
However, if you’re unable to move for a long period of time – such as after an operation, because of an illness or injury, or during a long journey – your blood flow can slow down considerably. A slow blood flow increases the chances of a
blood clot
forming.
In hospital
If you have to go into hospital for an operation or procedure, your risk of getting a blood clot increases. This is because DVT is more likely to occur when you’re unwell or inactive, or less active than usual.
As a patient, your risk of developing DVT depends on the type of treatment you’re having. You may be at increased risk of DVT if any of the following apply:
you’re having an operation that takes longer than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the operation is on your leg, hip or abdomen
you’re having an operation for an inflammatory or abdominal condition, such as
appendicitis
you’re confined to a bed, unable to walk, or spending a large part of the day in a bed or chair for at least three days
You may also be at increased risk of DVT if you’re much less active than usual because of an operation or serious injury and have other DVT risk factors, such as a family history of the condition.
When you’re admitted to hospital you’ll be assessed for your risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment.
Blood vessel damage
If the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, it may become narrowed or blocked, which can cause a blood clot to form.
Blood vessels can be damaged by injuries such as broken bones or severe muscle damage. Sometimes, blood vessel damage that occurs during surgery can cause a blood clot, particularly in operations on the lower half of your body.
Conditions such as vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels),
varicose veins
and some forms of medication, such as
chemotherapy
, can also damage blood vessels.
Medical and genetic conditions
Your risk of getting DVT is increased if you have a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal. These conditions include:
cancer – cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and
radiotherapy
can increase this risk further
heart disease
and lung disease
infectious conditions, such as hepatitis
inflammatory conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
thrombophilia – a genetic condition where your blood has an increased tendency to clot
antiphospholipid syndrome – an immune system disorder that causes an increased risk of blood clots
Pregnancy
During pregnancy, blood clots more easily. It’s the body’s way of preventing too much blood being lost during childbirth.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) – DVT and pulmonary embolism – affects about 1 in 100,000 women of childbearing age.
DVTs are also rare in pregnancy, although pregnant women are up to 10 times more likely to develop thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age. A clot can form at any stage of pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after the birth.
Having thrombophilia (a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to clot), or having a parent, or brother or sister, who’s had a thrombosis, increase your risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy.
Other risk factors during pregnancy include:
being over 35 years old
being
obese
(with a BMI of 30 or more)
expecting 2 or more babies
having recently had a caesarean section
being immobile for long periods of time
smoking (find out how to
stop smoking
)
having severe
varicose veins
dehydration
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is usually used to treat pregnant women with DVT. LMWH is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. It’s given by injection and doesn’t affect your developing baby.
Contraceptive pill and HRT
The
combined contraceptive pill
and
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
both contain the female hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen causes the blood to clot a bit more easily than normal, so your risk of getting DVT is slightly increased. There’s no increased risk from the
progestogen-only contraceptive pill
.
Other causes
Your risk of getting DVT is also increased if you or a close relative have previously had DVT and:
you’re overweight or obese
you smoke
you’re dehydrated
you’re over 60 – particularly if you have a condition that restricts your mobility
Deep vein thrombosis treatment
If you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you’ll need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant.
Anticoagulation
Anticoagulant medicines prevent blood clots getting bigger. They can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism).
Although they’re often referred to as “blood-thinning” medicines, anticoagulants don’t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.
Heparin and warfarin are 2 types of anticoagulants that are used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After this initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.
Heparin
Heparin is available in 2 different forms:
standard (unfractioned) heparin
low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
Standard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as:
an intravenous injection – an injection straight into one of your veins
an intravenous infusion – where a continuous drip of heparin (via a pump) is fed through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm (this must be done in hospital)
a subcutaneous injection – an injection under your skin
LMWH is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.
The dose of standard (unfractionated) heparin to treat a blood clot varies significantly from person to person, so the dosage must be carefully monitored and adjusted if necessary. You may need to stay in hospital for 5 to 10 days and have frequent
blood tests
to ensure you receive the right dose.
LMWH works differently from standard heparin. It contains small molecules, which means its effects are more reliable and you won’t have to stay in hospital and be monitored.
Both standard heparin and LMWH can cause side effects, including:
a skin rash and other
allergic reactions
bleeding
weakening of the bones if taken for a long time (although rare with LMWH)
In rare cases, heparin can also cause an extreme reaction that makes existing blood clots worse and causes new clots to develop. This reaction, and weakening of your bones, is less likely to occur when taking LMWH.
In most cases, you’ll be given LMWH because it’s easier to use and causes fewer side effects.
Warfarin
Warfarin
is taken as a tablet. You may need to take it after initial treatment with heparin to prevent further blood clots occurring. Your doctor may recommend that you take warfarin for 3 to 6 months. In some cases, it may need to be taken for longer, even for life.
As with standard heparin, the effects of warfarin vary from person to person. You’ll need to be closely monitored by having frequent blood tests to ensure you’re taking the right dosage.
When you first start taking warfarin, you may need to have 2 to 3 blood tests a week until your regular dose is decided. After this, you should only need to have a blood test every 4 weeks at an anticoagulant outpatient clinic.
Warfarin can be affected by your diet, any other medicines you’re taking, and by how well your liver is working.
If you’re taking warfarin you should:
keep your diet consistent
limit the amount of
alcohol
you drink (no more than 14 units of alcohol a week)
take your dose of warfarin at the same time every day
not start to take any other medicine without checking with your GP, pharmacist or anticoagulant specialist
not take herbal medicines
Warfarin isn’t recommended for pregnant women who are given heparin injections for the full length of treatment.
Rivaroxaban
Rivaroxaban is a medication recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a possible treatment for adults with DVT, or to help prevent recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism.
Rivaroxaban comes in tablet form. It’s a type of anticoagulant known as a directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It prevents blood clots forming by inhibiting a substance called factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin (an enzyme that helps blood clot).
Treatment usually lasts 3 months and involves taking rivaroxaban twice a day for the first 21 days and then once a day until the end of the course.
Read the
NICE guidance about rivaroxaban
Apixaban
NICE also recommends apixaban as a possible method of treatment and prevention for DVT and pulmonary embolism.
Like rivaroxaban, apixaban is a DOAC that’s taken orally as a tablet, and prevents blood clots forming by hindering factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin.
Treatment usually lasts at least 3 months and involves taking apixaban twice a day.
Read the
NICE guidance about apixaban
Compression stockings
Wearing compression stockings helps prevent calf pain and swelling, and lowers the risk of ulcers developing after having DVT.
They can also help prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. This is damage to leg tissue caused by the increase in venous pressure that occurs when a vein is blocked by a clot and blood is diverted to the outer veins.
After having DVT, stockings should be worn every day for at least 2 years. This is because symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome may develop several months or even years after having a DVT.
Compression stockings should be fitted professionally and your prescription should be reviewed every 3 to 6 months. The stockings need to be worn all day but can be taken off before going to bed or in the evening while you rest with your leg raised. A spare pair of compression stockings should also be provided.
Exercise
Your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly once compression stockings have been prescribed. This can help prevent symptoms of DVT returning and may help to improve or prevent complications of DVT, such as post-thrombotic syndrome.
Raising your leg
As well as wearing compression stockings, you might be advised to raise your leg whenever you’re resting. This helps to relieve the pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf itself.
When raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. This will help the returning blood flow from your calf. Putting a cushion underneath your leg while you’re lying down should help raise your leg above the level of your hip.
You can also slightly raise the end of your bed to ensure that your foot and calf are slightly higher than your hip.

preventing DVT
Inferior vena cava filters
Although anticoagulant medicines and compression stockings are usually the only treatments needed for DVT, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters may be used as an alternative. This is usually because anticoagulant treatment needs to be stopped, isn’t suitable, or isn’t working.
IVC filters are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They trap large fragments of a blood clot and stop it travelling to the heart and lungs. They can be used to help prevent blood clots developing in the legs of people diagnosed with:
DVT
pulmonary embolism
multiple severe injuries
IVCs can be placed in the vein permanently, or newer types of filters can be placed temporarily and removed after the risk of a blood clot has decreased.
The procedure to insert an IVC filter is carried out using a
local anaesthetic
(where you’re awake but the area is numb). A small cut is made in the skin and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin area. The catheter is guided using an
ultrasound scan
. The IVC filter is then inserted through the catheter and into the vein.
Complications of deep vein thrombosis
The 2 main complications of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.
Pulmonary embolism
A pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of DVT. It happens when a piece of blood clot (DVT) breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to your lungs, where it blocks one of the blood vessels. In severe cases this can be fatal.
If the clot is small, it might not cause any symptoms. If it’s medium-sized, it can cause chest pain and
breathing difficulties
. A large clot can cause the lungs to collapse, resulting in
heart failure
, which can be fatal.
About one in 10 people with an untreated DVT develops a severe pulmonary embolism.
Post-thrombotic syndrome
If you’ve had a DVT, you may develop long-term symptoms in your calf known as post-thrombotic syndrome. This affects around 20-40% of people with a history of DVT.
If you have DVT, the blood clot in the vein of your calf can divert the flow of blood to other veins, causing an increase in pressure. This can affect the tissues of your calf and lead to symptoms, including:
calf pain
swelling
a rash
ulcers on the calf
(in severe cases)
When a DVT develops in your thigh vein, there’s an increased risk of post-thrombotic syndrome occurring. It’s also more likely to occur if you’re overweight or if you’ve had more than one DVT in the same leg.
Deep vein thrombosis prevention
If you’re admitted to hospital or planning to go into hospital for surgery, your risk of developing a blood clot while you’re there will be assessed.
Surgery and some medical treatments can increase your risk of developing DVT – see
causes of DVT
for more information.
If you’re thought to be at risk of developing DVT, your healthcare team can take a number of measures to prevent a blood clot forming.
Before going into hospital
If you’re going into hospital to have an operation, and you’re taking the
combined contraceptive pill
or
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
, you’ll be advised to temporarily stop taking your medication four weeks before your operation.
Similarly, if you’re taking medication to prevent blood clots, such as
aspirin
, you may be advised to stop taking it one week before your operation.
There’s less risk of getting DVT when having a
local anaesthetic
compared with a
general anaesthetic
. Your doctor will discuss whether it’s possible for you to have a local anaesthetic.
While you’re in hospital
There are a number of things your healthcare team can do to help reduce your risk of getting DVT while you’re in hospital.
For example, they’ll make sure you have enough to drink so you don’t become
dehydrated
, and they’ll also encourage you to move around as soon as you’re able to.
Depending on your risk factors and individual circumstances, a number of different medications can be used to help prevent DVT. For example:
anticoagulant medicines – such as dabigatran etexilate or fondaparinux sodium, which are often used to help prevent blood clots after certain types of surgery, including orthopaedic surgery
low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) – often used in many cases to help prevent blood clots, including during and shortly after pregnancy
unfractionated heparin (UFH) – often used in people with severe kidney impairment or established
kidney failure
Compression stockings or compression devices are also commonly used to help keep the blood in your legs circulating.
Compression stockings are worn around your feet, lower legs and thighs, and fit tightly to encourage your blood to flow more quickly around your body.
Compression devices are inflatable and work in the same way as compression stockings, inflating at regular intervals to squeeze your legs and encourage blood flow.
Your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly after you’ve been prescribed compression stockings. Keeping mobile can help prevent the
symptoms of DVT
returning and may help prevent or improve
complications of DVT
, such as post-thrombotic syndrome.

treating DVT
When you leave hospital
You may need to continue to take anticoagulant medicine and wear compression stockings when you leave hospital.
Before you leave, your healthcare team should advise you about how to use your treatment, how long to continue using it for, and who to contact if you experience any problems.
Lifestyle changes
You can reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:
not
smoking
eating a
healthy, balanced diet
getting
regular exercise
maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you’re
obese
Travelling
See your GP before long-distance travel if you’re at risk of getting a DVT, or if you’ve had a DVT in the past.
If you’re planning a long-distance plane, train or car journey (journeys of six hours or more), make sure you:
drink plenty of water
avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol because it can cause
dehydration
avoid taking sleeping pills because they can cause immobility
perform simple leg exercises, such as regularly flexing your ankles
take occasional short walks when possible – for example, during refuelling stopovers
wear elastic compression stockings

preventing DVT when you travel
Travel insurance
If you’re travelling abroad, it’s very important to ensure you’re prepared should you or a family member fall ill.
Make sure you have full travel insurance to cover the cost of any healthcare you may need while abroad. This is particularly important if you have a pre-existing medical condition, such as
cancer
or
heart disease
, which may increase your risk of developing DVT.
DVT can be a very serious condition, and it’s important you receive medical assistance as soon as possible. Treating DVT promptly will help minimise the risk of complications."

About cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.
It can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. Over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.
Most cases of cystic fibrosis in the UK are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. It’s estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis.
A number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition, but unfortunately average life expectancy is reduced for people who have it.
Symptoms of cystic fibrosis
Symptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood.
Some of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include:
recurring
chest infections
difficulty putting on weight
frequent, wet-sounding
coughs
diarrhoea
occasional wheezing and
shortness of breath
People with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including
diabetes
, thin, weakened bones (
osteoporosis
) and liver problems.

symptoms of cystic fibrosis
Causes of cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents.
The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways.
To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene – one from each of their parents. Their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally.
If both parents carry the faulty gene, there’s a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis.
Read more about the
causes of cystic fibrosis
Screening and testing for cystic fibrosis
Most cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the
newborn blood spot test
.
This involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby’s heel and testing it for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.
More tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis, such as:
a sweat test – to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal
a genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis
These tests can also be carried out in older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who haven’t been screened previously.
If you have a family history of cystic fibrosis, you can be tested to determine if you’re at risk of having a child with the condition by checking if you’re a “carrier” of the faulty gene that causes it.

how cystic fibrosis is diagnosed
Treatments for cystic fibrosis
There’s currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent complications, and make the condition easier to live with.
Possible treatments include:
antibiotics
to prevent and treat
chest infections
medicines to make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up
medicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation
special techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs
medicines that help the person absorb food better
following a special diet and taking supplements to prevent
malnutrition
A
lung transplant
may eventually be needed if the lungs become greatly damaged.

treating cystic fibrosis
Outlook for cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time.
Eventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly.
The outlook for cystic fibrosis has improved considerably in recent years because of advancements in treatment, although most people with cystic fibrosis will have a shorter-than-average life expectancy.
Currently, about half of the people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this.
Information about you
If you or your child has cystic fibrosis, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Symptoms of cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis can cause a range of problems. The lungs and digestive system are the main areas that are affected.
Symptoms tend to start in early childhood, but sometimes they can develop soon after birth and very occasionally they may not be obvious until adulthood.
Nowadays, cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed before symptoms appear, through screening tests carried out soon after birth. Read more about
screening for cystic fibrosis
.
The main problems associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below.
Lung problems
Cystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. This can cause:
recurring
chest infections
– these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria
persistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened (
bronchiectasis
)
increased
coughing
occasional wheezing and
shortness of breath
Over time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.
Digestive system problems
The mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which can affect how food travels through the gut and how it’s broken down or absorbed.
This can cause:
a serious bowel obstruction in the first few days of life (meconium ileus) – this will often need an operation to remove the blockage
jaundice
diarrhoea
or large, smelly stools
problems putting on weight and growing – this can occur because the body struggles to digest and absorb nutrients (
malnutrition
)
diabetes
from late childhood or early adulthood – this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damaged
Other problems
People with cystic fibrosis can also experience a number of other problems, including:
sinusitis
nasal polyps
thin, weakened bones (
osteoporosis
) – this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition
swelling and pain in the joints (
arthritis
or arthralgia) from late childhood
difficulty conceiving children – most men with cystic fibrosis are unable to have children naturally (although some fertility treatments may still work) because the tubes that carry sperm don’t develop correctly; women can become pregnant, however
liver problems caused by the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus
leaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits (
stress incontinence
)
Causes of cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents.
The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways – particularly the lungs and digestive system.
The condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it.
How cystic fibrosis is inherited
Genes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father.
To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents.
This can happen if the parents are ‘carriers’ of the faulty gene. This means they don’t have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene.
It’s estimated that around 1 in every 25 people in the UK are carriers of the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.
If both parents are carriers, there’s a:
25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won’t have cystic fibrosis or be able to pass it on
50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier
25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have cystic fibrosis
This is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
Diagnosing cystic fibrosis
Tests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age.
Most cases are now detected soon after birth through newborn screening, but older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who weren’t screened can also have tests to check for the condition.
Tests to find out if you are a ‘carrier’ of the faulty gene responsible for cystic fibrosis may also be recommended for some people.
Newborn screening
A
newborn blood spot test
is offered to all babies in Scotland to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis.
When your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.
You should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you’ll be asked to attend a hospital appointment.
The screening result isn’t 100% accurate, so more tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.
Confirming a diagnosis
Tests to confirm a diagnosis will be carried out if screening suggests that your child may have cystic fibrosis, or your doctor thinks you could have the condition and you haven’t been screened previously.
Two main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis:
sweat test – a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal
genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis
The sweat test is most commonly used, although genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that’s causing the condition.
Carrier testing
Testing to find out if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis may be useful if:
you have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent, who’s a known carrier
you have a close relative with cystic fibrosis
your partner is known to carry the cystic fibrosis gene
This can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. The sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene.
Finding out whether you’re a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you’re at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. A genetic counsellor will explain the results of the test to you and discuss the implications and options available for future pregnancies.
Treating cystic fibrosis
There’s currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but it’s possible to help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with.
A person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. A care plan will be drawn up that’s tailored to their individual needs.
A range of treatments may be used and sometimes treatment in hospital will be needed. Regular appointments to monitor the condition will also be recommended.
Some of the main treatments for cystic fibrosis include:
Medications for lung problems
People with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. These may be swallowed, inhaled or injected.
Some of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are:
antibiotics
to prevent and treat
chest infections
medicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder
a medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body – although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis
bronchodilators
to widen the airways and help make breathing easier
steroid medication
to treat nasal polyps (small growths inside the nose)
It’s also important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with all
routine vaccinations
and have the
flu jab
each year once they’re old enough.
Airway clearance techniques
In addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. A physiotherapist can give you advice.
Some of the main techniques include:
active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) – a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing
autogenic drainage – a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs
modified postural drainage – a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs
airway clearance devices – handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of £45-60 for one of these devices
Your care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above.
Dietary and nutritional advice
For people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill.
However, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they’re a baby. Occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem.
A dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoid
malnutrition
. They may recommend:
taking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion – the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person
following a special balanced diet that’s high in calories (energy), fat and protein
taking vitamin and mineral supplements
Lung transplants
In severe cases of cystic fibrosis, when the lungs stop working properly and all medical treatments have failed to help, a
lung transplant
may be recommended.
A lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis.
The outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they’re often younger and in better general health. It’s estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant.
The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on
lung transplants in cystic fibrosis
.
Treatments for associated problems
People with cystic fibrosis can have a number of other problems that may benefit from treatment.
For example:
exercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with cystic fibrosis – any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you’re not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice
medicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn’t get enough vitaminD and calcium (from their diet and/or from supplements)
insulin medication and a special diet may help someone with
diabetes
caused by cystic fibrosis control their blood sugar levels"

About cystitis
Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bladder infection.
It’s a common type of
urinary tract infection (UTI)
, particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days.
However, some people experience episodes of cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment.
There’s also a chance that cystitis could lead to a more serious
kidney infection
in some cases, so it’s important to seek professional advice if your symptoms don’t improve.
Signs and symptoms of cystitis
The main symptoms of cystitis include:
pain, burning or stinging when you pee
needing to pee more often and urgently than normal
urine that’s dark, cloudy or strong smelling
pain low down in your tummy
feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired
Possible symptoms in young children include a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, weakness, irritability, reduced appetite and vomiting.
Read more about the
symptoms of cystitis
When to get professional advice
Speak to your pharmacist if you think you may have cystitis or symptoms of a urine infection. Women who have had cystitis before don’t necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as mild cases often get better without treatment. You can try the self-help measures, or ask your pharmacist for advice.
Pharmacy First Scotland: Urinary infection treatment from your pharmacy
Women over 16 with symptoms of a mild urinary infection can get advice and treatment directly from their pharmacist through the Pharmacy First Scotland service. Your pharmacist may be able to provide you with treatment to clear the infection, although there may be situations where they will recommend you see your GP. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
You should see your GP if:
your symptoms don’t start to improve within a few days
you get cystitis frequently
you have severe symptoms, such as blood in your urine
you’re pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis
you’re a man and have symptoms of cystitis
your child has symptoms of cystitis
Your GP should be able to diagnose the problem by asking about your symptoms. They may test a sample of your urine for bacteria to help confirm the diagnosis.
What causes cystitis?
Most cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body).
It’s not always clear how this happens, but it can be caused by:
having sex
wiping your bottom after going to the toilet – particularly if you wipe from back to front
inserting a tampon or
urinary catheter
(a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder)
using a
diaphragm
for contraception
Women may get cystitis more often than men because their anus (back passage) is closer to their urethra, and their urethra is much shorter, which means bacteria may be able to get into the bladder more easily.
Read more about the
causes of cystitis
Treatments for cystitis
If you see your pharmacist with symptoms of cystitis you can be treated under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. If you are female over 16 with signs of a mild urine infection, the pharmacist may offer you a course of
antibiotics
to treat the infection where appropriate. These should start to have an effect within a day or two.
If you’ve had cystitis before and don’t feel you need to see your pharmacist or GP, you may want to treat your symptoms at home.
Until you’re feeling better, it may help to:
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
drink plenty of water
hold a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs
avoid having sex
Some people find it helpful to try over-the-counter products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate), but there’s a lack of evidence to suggest they’re effective.
If you keep getting cystitis, your GP may give you an antibiotic prescription to take to a pharmacy whenever you develop symptoms, without needing to see your doctor first. Your GP can also prescribe a low dose of antibiotics for you to take continuously over several months if necessary.

treating cystitis
Preventing cystitis
If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it’s not clear how effective most of these measures are.
These measures include:
not using perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals – use plain, unperfumed varieties
having a shower, rather than a bath – this avoids exposing your genitals to the chemicals in your cleaning products for too long
going to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and always emptying your bladder fully
staying well hydrated – drinking plenty of fluids may help to stop bacteria multiplying in your bladder
always wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet
emptying your bladder as soon as possible after having sex
contraception instead
wearing underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon, and not wearing tight jeans and trousers
Drinking cranberry juice has traditionally been recommended as a way of reducing your chances of getting cystitis. However, large studies have suggested it doesn’t make a significant difference.
Symptoms of cystitis
Cystitis can cause problems with peeing and make you feel unwell.
Symptoms of cystitis in adults
Cystitis in adults can cause:
pain, burning or stinging when you pee
needing to pee more often and urgently than normal
feeling like you need to pee again soon after going to the toilet
urine that’s dark, cloudy or strong-smelling
pain low down in your tummy
feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired
blood in your urine
In adults, cystitis doesn’t usually cause a high temperature (fever). If you have a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above and pain in your lower back or sides, it may be a sign of a
kidney infection
.
Symptoms of cystitis in children
It can be difficult to tell whether a child has cystitis, because the symptoms can be vague and young children cannot easily communicate how they feel.
Possible symptoms of cystitis in young children may include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
weakness and tiredness
irritability
reduced appetite
vomiting
Children with cystitis can sometimes also have symptoms usually found in adults, such as pain when peeing, peeing more often than normal and pain in their tummy.
When to see your GP
You should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of cystitis for the first time.
Cystitis isn’t usually a cause for serious concern, but the symptoms can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to get a proper diagnosis.
If you’re a woman who has had cystitis before, you don’t necessarily need to see your GP again. Cystitis is very common in women and mild cases often get better on their own. Speak to a pharmacist if you need any advice about
treating cystitis
.
However, you should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or don’t start to get better in a few days, you get cystitis frequently, or you’re pregnant.
Children and men should always be seen by a GP if they have symptoms of cystitis, as the condition is less common and could be more serious in these groups.
Causes of cystitis
Cystitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it sometimes happens when the bladder is irritated or damaged for another reason.
Bacterial infections
Most infections are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) and start to multiply.
Cystitis is much more common in women than men, probably because the anus (back passage) is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is much shorter.
It’s not always obvious how the bacteria get into the bladder, but it can be caused by:
having sex
wiping your bottom after going to the toilet – particularly if you wipe from back to front
inserting a tampon or
urinary catheter
(a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder)
using a
diaphragm
for contraception
What can increase your risk?
There are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing an infection in your bladder.
Not being able to empty your bladder
If you’re unable to empty your bladder fully, any bacteria that get inside may not be flushed out when you go to the toilet and can multiply more easily.
You may not be able to empty your bladder fully if:
you have a blockage in your urinary system, such as a bladder stone
you’re pregnant, as the baby may be pressing on your bladder
(in men) you have an
enlarged prostate
gland that presses on the urethra
Menopause
For women who have been through the
menopause
, or are going through it, the lining of the urethra can shrink and become thinner because of a lack of the hormone oestrogen.
The natural balance of bacteria in the vagina may also change, which can allow potentially harmful bacteria to become more common.
This can make the urethra more vulnerable to infection, which could spread into the bladder.
Diabetes
You’re more likely to get cystitis if you have
diabetes
– a condition where the level of sugar in your body becomes too high.
High levels of sugar in your urine can provide a good environment for bacteria to multiply, so any bacteria that get into the bladder are more likely to cause cystitis.
Other causes of cystitis
Cystitis can also be caused by damage or irritation to the urethra and bladder.
This can be the result of:
friction from sex
chemical irritants, such as those in perfumed soap or bubble bath
damage caused by a catheter or surgery on your bladder
radiotherapy
to your pelvis or treatment with certain
chemotherapy
medicines
a woman’s genitals having been deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons (an illegal practice called
female genital mutilation or FGM
)
Cystitis has also been linked to recreational use of the drug ketamine.
Treating cystitis
Mild cystitis will usually clear up on its own within a few days, although sometimes you may need to take antibiotics.
See your GP for advice and treatment if:
you have
symptoms of cystitis
for the first time
your symptoms don’t start to improve within a few days
you get cystitis frequently
you have severe symptoms, such as blood in your urine
you’re pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis
you’re a man and have symptoms of cystitis
your child has symptoms of cystitis
Women who have had cystitis before don’t necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as mild cases often get better without
antibiotics
. You can try the self-help measures or ask your pharmacist for advice.
Things you can try yourself
If you’ve had cystitis before and don’t feel you need to see your GP, the following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until the condition clears up:
take over-the-counter painkillers, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
– always read the medicine information leaflet beforehand to check whether you can take it, and check with your pharmacist if you’re not sure
drink plenty of water – it’s been suggested this may help flush the infection out of your bladder and some people find it helpful, although it’s not clear how effective it actually is
use a hot water bottle – holding a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs may reduce any discomfort
don’t have sex until you’re feeling better, because it may make the condition worse
Some people find drinking cranberry juice or using products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate) reduce their symptoms, but there’s a lack of evidence to suggest they’re effective.
These products are also not suitable for everyone. Check with your GP or pharmacist before trying them if you’re taking any other medication.
Antibiotics
In some cases, your GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics. This will usually involve taking a tablet or capsule 2 to 4 times a day for 3 days.
Antibiotics should start to have an effect quite quickly. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven’t started to improve within a few days.
Most people won’t have any side effects from antibiotic treatment, but possible side effects can include feeling or being sick,
itching
, a rash and
diarrhoea
.
If cystitis keeps coming back
If you keep getting cystitis (known as recurrent cystitis) your doctor may prescribe stand-by antibiotics or continuous antibiotics.
A stand-by antibiotic is a prescription you can take to a pharmacy the next time you have symptoms of cystitis, without needing to visit your GP first.
Continuous antibiotics are taken for several months to prevent further episodes of cystitis. These may be prescribed:
if cystitis usually occurs after having sex – you may be given a prescription for antibiotics to take within 2 hours of having sex
if cystitis is not related to having sex – you may be given a low-dose antibiotic to take for a trial period of 6 months
Your doctor may also recommend some measures you can take to prevent cystitis, although it’s not clear how effective these are."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/dental-abscess/,"Dental abscess
If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always
phone the dental practice that you normally attend
.
If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should
read our advice on dental emergencies
.
A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form inside the teeth, in the gums, or in the bone that holds the teeth in place. It’s caused by a bacterial infection.
An abscess at the end of a tooth is called a periapical abscess. An abscess in the gum is called a periodontal abscess.
Dental abscesses are often painful, but aren’t always. In either case, they should be looked at by a dentist.
It’s important to get help as soon as possible, because abscesses don’t go away on their own. They can sometimes spread to other parts of the body and make you ill.
Symptoms of a dental abscess
Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include:
an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse
pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum
pain that’s worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep
redness and swelling in your face
a tender, discoloured and/or loose tooth
shiny, red and swollen gums
sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink
bad breath and/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth
If the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have
difficulty swallowing
or breathing.
What to do if you have a dental abscess
You should see a dentist as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Avoid visiting your GP, as there is little they can do to help.
You can get help from:
your registered dentist – if it’s out of hours, they should have an answerphone message with details of how to access out-of-hours dental treatment
NHS 24
111
service – who can give you details of dental services in your area
your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) – who can tell you the phone number of your local dental access helpline
your local accident and emergency (A&E) department – if there are no other options or you’re having difficulty breathing
You may have to pay for emergency NHS dental treatment, depending on your circumstances.
Read about NHS dental charges.
Relieving your symptoms
While you’re waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain.
Ibuprofen
is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you’re unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take
paracetamol
instead. Aspirin shouldn’t be given to children under 16.
If one painkiller doesn’t relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16.
It may also help to:
avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse
try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth
use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth
These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn’t use them to delay getting help from a dentist.
Treatments for a dental abscess
Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.
Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include:
removing the affected tooth (extraction) – this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn’t possible
root canal treatment – a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it
incision and drainage – where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed)
Local anaesthetic
will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep).
Antibiotics
aren’t routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe.
What causes dental abscesses?
Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.
If you don’t keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to
tooth decay
or
gum disease
.
The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:
poor oral hygiene – plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don’t floss and brush your teeth regularly
consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink – these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess
an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums – bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums
having a weakened immune system – this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as
diabetes
, and those having treatment, including
steroid medication
or
chemotherapy
Preventing dental abscesses
You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.
To do this, you should:
use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line
brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day – spending at least two minutes each time
avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away – just spit out any excess toothpaste
cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks – particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed
visit your dentist regularly – your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health

What is depression?
Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.
While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it’s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.
With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.
Do I have depression?
Depression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. The symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. It’s also common for people with depression to have symptoms of
anxiety
.
Physical symptoms happen with depression too – these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.
If the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. It’s common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.

Severe symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal – as if life is no longer worth living. Read more about depression symptoms

Seeing a doctor about depression
Big changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. You’re also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it’s also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.
You can learn more about depression causes
here
.
​Symptoms and causes of depression
Symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.
Depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.
Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:
mild depression – it has some impact on daily life
moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life
severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day
A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of
psychotic depression
.
Below is a list of depression symptoms – it’s unlikely that one person would have all of them.
Psychological depression symptoms include:
continuous sadness or low mood
losing interest in things
losing motivation
not getting any enjoyment in life
feeling tearful
feeling guilty
feeling
anxious
feeling irritable
finding it hard to make decisions
feeling intolerant of other people
feeling helpless
feeling hopeless
low self-esteem
feeling
worried
thinking about
suicide
thinking about harming yourself
Physical symptoms include:
speaking or moving slower than usual
aches and pains that can’t be explained
losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight
constipation
loss of interest in sex
disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)
loss of energy
changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)
Social symptoms are common too. These include:
avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends
taking part in fewer social activities
neglecting interests and hobbies
doing poorly at work
difficulties with your family or home life
It’s not always possible to tell that you’re having symptoms of depression right away – it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don’t realise they’re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there’s a problem.
Depression and grief
Depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they’re different in many important ways. Depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss.
If you’re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it’s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.
People with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don’t get enjoyment from anything.
Learn more about the differences between grief and depression
here
.
Different types of depression
There are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:
Bipolar disorder
– people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as “manic depression”, experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as “mania”). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
is also called “winter depression”. It’s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.
Postnatal depression
happens to some women after they’ve had a baby. It’s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.
Learn more about how depression is diagnosed
here
.
Causes of depression
Depression doesn’t have one single cause – it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.
Different reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you’re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.
It’s common to hear about depression being brought on by a “downward spiral” – one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.
There are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There’s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.
Depression and illness
Long-lasting or life-threatening conditions like
cancer
or
coronary heart disease
can put you at higher risk of developing depression.
Many people don’t know that head injuries can cause depression, and a
severe head injury
can lead to emotional problems and mood swings.
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can happen as a result of immune system problems. It’s also possible, although rare, for a minor head injury to damage the pituitary gland. This is a gland the size of a pea which sits at the base of the brain and produces hormones that stimulate the thyroid. Damage to the pituitary gland can cause symptoms, including severe tiredness and a lack of interest in sex, which can then cause people to develop depression.
Depression and drugs and alcohol
“Drowning your sorrows” is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. Alcohol is categorised as a “strong depressant” which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life.
There’s evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax.
Other causes of depression
There are a number of things that can lead to developing depression.
Stressful events – big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. When these things happen, it’s important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone – this increases your risk of developing depression.
Giving birth – pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. Postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby.
Loneliness – your risk of depression gets higher if you aren’t in contact or spending time with family and friends.
Personality – some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. These include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. These personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life.
Family history – it’s more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before.
​Diagnosing and treating depression
There’s no physical test for depression.
If you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your GP. This is especially important if:
you have symptoms of depression that aren’t getting any better
you have thoughts of self-harm or
suicide
your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood
It can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them – but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.
Your GP may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn’t another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an
underactive thyroid
.
When you see your GP, they’ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you’re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.
Telling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your GP to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. It’s important to be as open as possible.
Your conversation with your GP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.
Treating depression
The first place to go is your GP – they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.
You may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you’d rather not talk to your GP.
Talking treatments for depression
There are a number of talking therapies for depression.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it’s recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.
You can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts – this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.
Most people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT.
Computerised CBT (CCBT)
This type of CBT is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. It should be supported by a healthcare professional – your GP may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the GP surgery to access it. CCBT involves a series of weekly sessions.
Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)
IPT is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. These can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement.
There’s evidence that suggests IPT can be as effective for depression as CBT or medication, but more research needs to be done.
Psychodynamic psychotherapy
This is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. You’ll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you’re thinking. This helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression.
Read more about psychotherapy
here
.
Counselling
Counselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that’s currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.
On the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential.
A counsellor helps you to think about what’s going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They’ll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don’t tell you what to do.
Antidepressants
Antidepressants
are medicines that treat depression symptoms. There are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.
Most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn’t the case for everyone. One type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. It can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.
Side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.
If you’re prescribed antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication – every week or two for at least four weeks. This is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.
If the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. People who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.
Antidepressants aren’t addictive. However, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. You can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
If your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you’ll usually be prescribed a modern type called a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
. Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cipramil (citalopram).
They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a “good mood” chemical.
SSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects.
They can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time.
Some SSRIs aren’t suitable for children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of
self-harm
and suicidal behaviour may increase if they’re taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
This group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression.
TCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs.
They work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood.
They’re generally quite safe, but it’s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly.
Side effects of TCAs may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person.
The side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication.
Other antidepressants
New antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine) and Zispin Soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs.
Venlafaxine and duloxetine are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.
Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though they’re not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.
Withdrawal symptoms
Antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including:
upset stomach
flu-like symptoms
anxiety
dizziness
vivid dreams at night
sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks
In most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor).
Withdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks.
Other treatments for depression
There is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.
St John’s Wort
St John’s Wort is a herbal treatment that you can buy from pharmacies and health food shops. Some people take it for depression. There’s some evidence that it can help the symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression, but doctors don’t recommend St John’s Wort because the amount of active ingredients change depending on the brand and batch. This means that you can never be sure what kind of effect it will have.
If you take St John’s Wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. St John’s Wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.
You shouldn’t take St John’s Wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can’t be certain that it’s safe.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – electric shock treatment
If you have severe depression and other treatments, like medication, haven’t worked, ECT might be recommended for you.
When receiving ECT, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. Electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical “shock” to your brain.
ECT is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks.
ECT can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems.
Most people find that ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed.
Lithium
If you’ve tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment.
There are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you’re taking one that works for you, it’s best not to change.
If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You’ll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you’re on the medication.
You’ll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet.
​Living with depression
There’s a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better.
Talking about depression
You can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. According to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress.
If you don’t feel comfortable talking about your symptoms and feelings with other people, you can write about how you feel or use poetry or art to express yourself – doing this can also help you to feel better.
Smoking, drugs, alcohol and depression
It might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse.
If you have depression it’s especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. Research has shown there’s a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use.
According to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression:
your symptoms get worse
you feel less interested in things
you’re more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression
you’re less likely to recover fully from depression
you feel more tired
you won’t respond as well to antidepressants
you’re more likely to stop taking antidepressants
You can get advice and support from your GP on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.
Learn more about stopping smoking
here
Learn more about help to cut down or stop drinking alcohol
here
Work, money, and depression
You might need to take time off work if your depression is caused by working too much, or if the symptoms are making it hard for you to do your job. However, research has shown that taking a long time off work can make depression worse, and that going back to work can help you to get better.
When you’re dealing with depression it’s important to avoid as much stress, work-related and otherwise, as you can. If you’re working you might be able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. This is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms.
The Equality Act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make it possible to employ people with disabilities – this can include people who have been diagnosed with depression and other mental health conditions.
You can find more information about dealing with stress at work

.
If your depression means you are unable to work, there are benefits you may be eligible to claim. These include:
Attendance Allowance
Carer’s Allowance
Council Tax Benefit
Personal Independence Payment (
PIP
)
Housing Benefit
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
Statutory Sick Pay
Bereavement and depression
Your depression can be triggered by losing someone who is close to you. The emotional blow suffered when a person you care about dies is powerful – it might feel like you will never recover from the loss.
Along with time, the right help and support can make it possible to start living your life again. Find out more about coping with a bereavement
here
.
Looking after someone who has depression
If you’re close to someone with depression, their condition can affect you too. Your relationship, and family life in general, can be strained, and you might not know what to do or how to help.
Talking about the situation can help. Finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. If the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you.
When suffering from depression, men are less likely to ask for help than women. They’re also more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the symptoms.
Depression and suicide
The majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression.
Warning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are:
making final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends
talking about death or suicide – this may be with direct statements, like “I wish I was dead”, but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: “I think dead people must be happier than us” or “wouldn’t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up”
self-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes
a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decision
If you’re feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your GP as soon as possible. They will be able to help you.
If you can’t or don’t want to contact your GP, call the Samaritans on 116 123, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Alternatively, visit the
Samaritans website
or email
jo@samaritans.org
.
Helping a suicidal friend or relative
If you see any of the above warning signs:
get professional help for the person
let them know they’re not alone and that you care about them
offer your support in finding other solutions to their problems
If you feel there is an immediate danger, stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of committing suicide, such as medication.
Over-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication.
Also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach.
​Psychotic depression
Some people who have severe depression will also experience symptoms of psychosis – these are hallucinations and delusional thinking.
Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression.
Symptoms of severe depression
People who have severe clinical depression feel sad and hopeless for most of the day, and feel no interest in anything. They feel this way practically every day, and getting through the day feels nearly impossible for them.
Other symptoms include:
fatigue (exhaustion)
losing pleasure in things
inability to concentrate
difficulty making decisions
sleep disturbance
appetite changes
feeling guilty
feeling that they’re worthless
having thoughts about suicide, or death
Read more about the different types of depression symptoms

.
Symptoms of psychosis
Moments of psychosis are known as psychotic episodes. The person experiencing a psychotic episode will have:
Delusions – beliefs or thoughts that are likely to be false.
Hallucinations – hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren’t there. Hearing voices is a common type of hallucination.
Hallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. They may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something.
People with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. People experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time.
The opposite symptom can also happen – psychomotor retardation can cause a person’s thoughts and the movement of their body to slow down.
People who have psychotic depression are at a higher risk of thinking about suicide.
Causes and treatments of psychotic depression
We don’t fully understand what causes psychotic depression yet. However, we know that depression doesn’t have one single cause, and that the condition has a lot of different triggers.
Causes of psychotic depression
Big, stressful events like divorce, serious illness, financial worries, or bereavement can trigger depression for some people.
Severe depression can run in families, which suggests genes might play a role in depression, but the reason some people develop psychosis as part of severe depression is not known.
Many people who have psychotic depression have experienced a difficult time in childhood, like a traumatic event.
Learn more about
causes of clinical depression
Treating psychotic depression
Treatment for psychotic depression has three main parts:
medication – taking a combination of
antipsychotics
and
antidepressants
can help to relieve psychosis symptoms
psychological therapies – cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy done one-to-one with a trained counsellor, and it has succeeded in helping some people with psychosis
social support – support with social needs like employment, education and accommodation
People with psychotic depression may have to spend some time in hospital to receive treatment.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, or electric shock treatment) is sometimes recommended if other treatments, including antidepressants, haven’t worked for severe depression.
Although treatment for psychotic depression is usually very effective, people with the condition still need follow-up appointments with their treatment team so they can be continuously monitored.
Getting help for someone with psychotic depression
Often friends, relatives, or carers have to seek help for a person with psychotic depression. This is because people with psychosis often don’t know they’re acting and thinking strangely.
If you’re worried about someone you know and think they may be experiencing psychosis, and they’ve been diagnosed with a mental health condition before, contact their community mental health team or social worker.
If they’ve never shown signs of a mental health condition and you think they may be experiencing psychotic depression, contact their GP or take them to Accident and Emergency (A&E).
If you think the person’s symptoms are putting them at risk, you can:
take them to the nearest A&E, if they agree
phone their GP
phone the local
out-of-hours GP
phone 999 and ask for an ambulance

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune skin condition that can be linked to
coeliac disease
.
How many people have dermatitis herpetiformis?
DH affects around 1 in 10,000 people.
DH can appear at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in those between the ages of 15 and 40.
It’s more common in men than women and is rare in children.
Symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
People with DH can have:
red, raised patches often with blisters that burst with scratching
severe itching and often stinging
The rash can affect any area of the skin but is most commonly seen on the:
elbows
knees
buttocks
The rash usually occurs on both sides of the body, for example on both elbows.
Dermatitis herpetiformis often affects the knees.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Gut symptoms
Most people with DH will have the same kind of gut damage seen with coeliac disease, but may not complain of gut symptoms like:
diarrhoea
constipation
stomach pain
bloating
Just over half (60%) of people with DH don’t have gut symptoms.
Causes of d
ermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
DH is caused by the body’s immune system reacting to a protein called gluten in foods containing wheat, barley and rye. This reaction causes a skin rash to develop.
Diagnosing d
ermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
A diagnosis of DH is confirmed by a skin test called a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure where a sample of skin is removed to be tested.
As DH is strongly linked to coeliac disease, blood tests may be taken for this condition as well.
What happens during a skin biopsy test?
During a skin biopsy test, a specialist skin doctor called a dermatologist will take a small sample of skin from an area without the rash. Samples of skin taken from the area with the rash don’t always give an accurate result.
The skin sample is then tested. If you test positive for DH you’ll be referred to a specialist gut doctor called a gastroenterologist to be tested for coeliac disease.
Diet before and during diagnosis
To ensure an accurate skin test is taken first time, it’s important to keep eating foods with gluten before and during diagnosis.
If you’ve already removed gluten from your diet, you must reintroduce it in more than one meal every day. You should do this for at least 6 weeks before having the tests.
Treating d
ermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
The treatment for DH is a lifelong gluten-free diet.
A gluten-free diet is when all gluten-containing foods are removed from your diet
Gluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and sometimes people are sensitive to oats too.
A gluten free diet should only start once the diagnosis of DH is given and a referral to a dietitian has been made.
Find out how to live with a gluten-free diet
How long does treatment take to work?
The length of time it takes for the skin to heal varies from person to person but it can take up to 2 years or more.
Medication during treatment
Some patients will be given medication to help them over this period of recovery.
Medication will only be given to control the skin itching and blisters and doesn’t treat any other symptoms.
The drug most likely to be used is called Dapsone.
Dapsone
Dapsone is taken in tablet form and must be swallowed.
It helps ease the itching and controls the development of blisters. It should work within a few days.
If you stop taking Dapsone before the gluten-free diet has taken effect, the rash will return.
Side effects of Dapsone
The most common side effect of Dapsone is
anaemia
.
Less common side effects are
headaches
and
depression
, while nerve damage is rare.
You’ll always be prescribed the lowest effective dose to help prevent these side effects.
DH should be monitored once the drug dose has been reduced.
Alternatives to Dapsone
Some people can’t tolerate Dapsone. If you’re one of these people, the following drugs can also be taken to clear the rash:
Sulphapyridine
Sulphamethoxypyridazine
Complications of d
ermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
DH can cause
the same conditions and complications as coeliac disease
.
Some potential complications of DH include:
osteoporosis
certain kinds of gut cancer
an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, such as
type 1 diabetes
and thyroid disease
As with coeliac disease, the risk of developing these is reduced by following a gluten-free diet."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/diabetes/diabetes/,"Diabetes
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.
There are two main types of diabetes –
type 1 diabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
.
Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.
There are 4.7 million people living with diabetes in the UK. That’s more than one in 15 people in the UK who has diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed).
This figure has nearly trebled since 1996, when there were 1.4 million. By 2025, it is estimated that 5 million people will have diabetes in the UK.
Pre-diabetes
Many more people have blood glucose levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.
This is sometimes known as prediabetes. If your blood glucose level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased.
It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.
When to see a doctor
You should therefore visit your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms, such as feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual, and feeling tired all the time.
It’s also advised to see your GP if you have risk factors of diabetes and are worried about developing diabetes in future.
Symptoms of diabetes
The main symptoms of diabetes are:
feeling very thirsty
urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of
thrush
cuts or wounds that heal slowly
blurred vision
Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over a few hours or even days.
Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.
What causes diabetes?
The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).
When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it’s broken down to produce energy.
However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there’s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn’t work properly.
Type 1 diabetes
In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body’s organs.
Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.
Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.
If you’re diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you’ll need insulin injections for the rest of your life.
You’ll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.
For example, you’ll need to
eat healthily
, take
regular exercise
and carry out regular blood tests.
Read more about
living with type 1 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.
If you’re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood glucose levels.
However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets.
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with
obesity
. Obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it’s more common in older people.

living with type 2 diabetes
Diabetic eye screening
Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year by the national diabetes retinal screening service.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated.
Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively.
Read more about diabetic eye screening
Gestational diabetes (in pregnancy)
During pregnancy, all women need to make more insulin. In some women this doesn’t happen and blood glucose levels rise – typically in the middle of pregnancy onwards.
Diabetes diagnosed in pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes.
Risk of gestational diabetes is increased with the same risk factors for type 2 diabetes (increased weight, at risk ethnicity and family history of diabetes), but also if you have given birth to a baby in the past who was bigger than expected.
For most women with gestational diabetes, blood glucose levels will return to normal after pregnancy. Although you will have an increased risk of developing diabetes in later life.
If you’re worried about gestational diabetes then discuss this with your midwife.
Blood glucose control is also very important for women with diabetes before pregnancy (type 1, type 2 or other kinds). If you’re planning a pregnancy or are in the early stages of pregnancy, it’s important to discuss this with your GP, midwife or hospital clinic.
Other types of diabetes
In addition to Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes, there are a range of other types of diabetes.
These types of diabetes are much rarer, with about 2% of people having them. The rare types of diabetes include:
different types of monogenic diabetes
cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
diabetes caused by rare syndromes
diabetes caused by certain medications such as steroids and antipsychotics
diabetes caused by surgery or hormonal imbalances
Unfortunately, many people with rarer types of diabetes are misdiagnosed leading to delays in getting the right treatment.

Treating dementia with Lewy bodies
About dementia with Lewy bodies
Dementia with Lewy bodies, also known as Lewy body dementia, is a common form of dementia estimated to affect more than 100,000 people in the UK.
The term “dementia” describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It’s rare in anyone younger than 65.
Symptoms usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years.
Signs and symptoms
People with dementia with Lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those with
Alzheimer’s disease
, but are also likely to have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space).
They may experience:
slowed movement, stiff limbs, and tremors
recurrent visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren’t there)
sleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day
fainting, unsteadiness, and
falls
People with the condition tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. These extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day.
Read more about the
symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies
What causes dementia with Lewy bodies?
Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with
Parkinson’s disease
, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement.
It’s not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it’s thought they disrupt the brain’s normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another.
Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families.
Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies
If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.
Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary.
At one of these clinics, you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. You may also have
blood tests
and brain scans.
The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by dementia with Lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or something else entirely.
Read more about
how dementia with Lewy bodies is diagnosed
How dementia with Lewy bodies is managed
There is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any medication that will slow it down.
However, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat
Alzheimer’s disease
) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people.
Supportive treatments – such as physiotherapy,
occupational therapy
, and speech and language therapy – can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication.
Psychological therapies and specific
dementia activities
, such as memory cafés, can also help with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation.
Read more about
treating dementia with Lewy bodies
Outlook
How quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.
The average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease – around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer’s disease, this can be highly variable.
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. The NHS, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.
Symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies
The symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of a few years.
Like other forms of dementia, the condition causes problems with:
thinking speed
language
understanding
judgement
memory (although significant memory loss may not occur until later on)
People with dementia with Lewy bodies may also have other symptoms that can help distinguish it from other types of dementia, such as:
extreme swings between alertness and confusion or drowsiness, which may happen unexpectedly and change from hour to hour or day to day
slow movement, stiff limbs, and tremors (as seen in
Parkinson’s disease
), which cause shuffling when walking
seeing or hearing things that aren’t real (hallucinations), which can range from pleasant to distressing
fainting, unsteadiness, and
falls
sleep disturbances, which can cause talking in your sleep or acting out dreams
loss of facial expression
difficulty swallowing
(dysphagia)
depression
These symptoms can make daily activities very difficult and can lead to further health problems, such as injuries from falls, and
chest infections
caused by accidentally inhaling food instead of swallowing it.
Seeking medical advice
If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.
Symptoms of dementia can have a number of different causes. Your GP will be able to carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for further tests if necessary.
Read more about
diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies
Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies
Confirming a diagnosis of dementia can be difficult, particularly when the condition is in its early stages. This is because many of the symptoms of dementia can also be caused by other conditions.
For dementia with Lewy bodies to be diagnosed correctly, you will have a number of tests and assessments, including:
an assessment of your symptoms – for example, whether you have typical
symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies
a full assessment of your mental abilities
a physical examination
a review of the medication you are taking
a range of tests, including
blood tests
, to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a
vitamin B12 deficiency
brain scans, such as a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
or a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
, which can check for signs of a stroke, brain tumour or brain shrinkage – a single photon emission CT (SPECT) scan, which looks at the dopamine system in the brain, can also sometimes help
Some of these tests can be carried out by your GP. Some will be carried out by other specialists, such as a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system), an elderly care physician, or a psychiatrist with experience of treating dementia.
Assessing your mental abilities
The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used to help test mental ability.
The MMSE can be used to assess a number of different mental abilities, including:
short- and long-term memory
attention span
concentration
language and communication skills
ability to plan
ability to understand instructions
The MMSE involves a series of tasks, which together carry a maximum score of 30 points. Example tasks include:
memorising a short list of objects and then repeating the list back
correctly identifying the day of the week, the date, or the year
The MMSE is not a test to diagnose dementia, but it’s useful for assessing the level of mental impairment a person with dementia may have.
Treating dementia with Lewy bodies
There’s currently no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies, but treatments can help manage the symptoms.
First of all, your future health and social care needs will need to be assessed and a care plan drawn up.
This is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as:
what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible
whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in
whether you need any financial assistance
Read more about
care plans
Medication
Medication cannot stop the progression of dementia with Lewy bodies, but it can sometimes help reduce the symptoms.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl) or rivastigmine (Exelon), may help improve hallucinations, confusion, and drowsiness in some people.
These medicines work by increasing levels of the chemical acetylcholine in the brain, which improves the ability of the brain cells to send signals to each other.
Common side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include feeling and being sick,
diarrhoea
,
headaches
, fatigue (extreme tiredness), and muscle cramps.
Other medications
Other medications that may help control some of the symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies include:
levodopa (a medication used to treat
Parkinson’s disease
) can help reduce movement problems, although it can also worsen hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, so it needs to be carefully monitored by your doctor
antidepressants
may help you cope if you have depression
clonazepam can sometimes help improve your sleep if you experience sleep disturbances
Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, should be avoided wherever possible, and should only be used to treat severely challenging behaviour that is putting you or others at risk of harm. This is because they can cause a range of serious side effects, including rigidity and immobility.
If antipsychotics are needed, they will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose, for the shortest possible time, by a specialist experienced in treating dementia with Lewy bodies.
Supportive measures and treatments
In addition to medication, there are a number of therapies and practical measures that can help make everyday living easier for someone with dementia. These include:
occupational therapy
to identify problem areas in everyday life, such as getting dressed, and help work out practical solutions
speech and language therapy to help improve any communication or swallowing problems
physiotherapy to help with movement difficulties
psychological treatments, such as
cognitive stimulation
, to help improve memory, problem-solving skills and language ability
relaxation techniques, such as massage, and music or dance therapy
home modifications, such as removing loose carpets and potential trip hazards, ensuring the home is well lit, and adding grab bars and handrails
checking for problems with vision and hearing that could be contributing to hallucinations

living well with dementia
Legal matters
If you have been diagnosed with dementia, you will need to make arrangements for your care that take into account the gradual decline in your mental abilities. This should include ensuring that your wishes are upheld if you’re not able to make decisions for yourself.
You may wish to draw up an advance decision after first receiving a diagnosis of dementia. This makes your treatment preferences known now, in case you are unable to do this in the future.
You may also want to consider giving a relative lasting
power of attorney
. This is the power to make decisions about you if you are unable to.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/dizziness-lightheadedness/,"Dizziness (lightheadedness)
Dizziness (lightheadedness) is a common symptom that’s not usually a sign of anything serious, but should be investigated by a doctor.
The term “dizziness” means different things to different people – some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning.
Because the symptom is quite vague and can be caused by a wide range of things, it may not always be easy to identify the underlying cause.
This page explains what you should do if you feel dizzy for no apparent reason, and outlines the most common causes.
When to seek help with dizziness
Speak to your GP if you:
are feeling lightheaded or off balance
have fainting episodes
experience headaches
Your GP will want to establish exactly what you mean by dizziness, and check that you’re not actually describing
vertigo
– a severe type of dizziness, where you feel your surroundings are spinning or moving.
They’ll also want to know:
whether the dizziness started for no apparent reason, or if it followed an illness
whether you have repeated episodes of dizziness and, if so, when you tend to experience these
how long the dizziness lasts
Dizziness can sometimes be caused by an ear condition. A simple way of distinguishing between ear-related dizziness and dizziness due to other causes is to determine whether it occurs only when you’re upright or also when you’re lying down.
If feeling dizzy occurs when you’re upright its probably not related to the ear. If it happens when you’re lying down, its usually caused by a viral ear infection, which can’t be treated with
antibiotics
.
It’s a good idea to keep a diary recording when and where you feel dizzy and take it with you to your GP appointment. It’s helpful to note:
what you were doing at the time you felt dizzy
how long it lasted and how bad it was
whether you had any other symptoms – such as fainting, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, headache,
hearing loss
or
tinnitus
If you’re taking prescription medicine, your GP will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect. If necessary, they can prescribe a different medication for you to try.
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and investigations.
Common causes of dizziness
The most common causes are:
labyrinthitis
– an inner ear infection that affects your hearing and balance, and can lead to a severe form of dizziness called
vertigo
migraine
– dizziness may come on before or after the headache, or even without the headache
stress
or
anxiety
– particularly if you tend to hyperventilate (breathe abnormally quickly when resting)
low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia)
– which is usually seen in people with
diabetes
postural
hypotension
– a sudden fall in blood pressure when you suddenly sit or stand up, which goes away after lying down. This is more common in older people
dehydration
or heat exhaustion – dehydration could be due to not drinking enough during exercise, or illness that causes vomiting,
diarrhoea
or fever
vertebrobasilar insufficiency – decreased blood flow in the back of the brain, which may be caused by the blood vessels that lead to the brain from the heart being blocked (known as atherosclerosis)
Less common causes of dizziness
Less common causes include:
having a severe illness or condition that affects the whole body
using recreational drugs or consuming excessive amounts of
alcohol
(either
binge drinking
or long-term
alcohol misuse
)
certain types of prescription medicine – such as
antidepressants
or blood pressure medication
having a heart rhythm problem – such as
atrial fibrillation (a fast, irregular heartbeat)
carbon monoxide poisoning"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/downs-syndrome/,"Down’s syndrome
A baby with Down’s syndrome is born with more of chromosome 21 in some or all of the cells that make up their DNA. It’s also known as Trisomy 21.
People with Down’s syndrome may lead active, healthy and independent lives into their 60s, 70s and beyond.
Most will have mild to moderate learning disabilities and some may have more complex needs.
It cannot be known before birth if a person will need any additional help and support.
Living with Down’s syndrome
There are increasing opportunities and support in education, work and housing for people with Down’s syndrome.
People with Down’s syndrome can live healthy and fulfilling lives as part of their families and communities.
Some may:
live independently
have jobs
be in relationships
socialise with minimal support.
Evidence suggests most families of people with the condition feel satisfied with their lives.
Many children with Down’s syndrome attend mainstream school and receive additional support if they need it.
Congenital and rare condition register
Babies with Down’s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.
The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.
It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.
Read more about CARDRISS
Down’s syndrome and health
Many children with Down’s syndrome have similar health conditions to all children.
Some health conditions can be more common in people with Down’s syndrome, but some are less common.
Around half of all children with Down’s syndrome will have heart issues, although fewer than 1 in 5 of those may need surgery.
They’re more likely to have muscle tone and digestion issues and may have reduced hearing or vision.
However, they’re less likely to develop some cancers and types of heart disease.
Regular health checks can make sure any health conditions are picked up early and managed.
Down’s syndrome is not a life-limiting condition. People with the condition can lead active, healthy and fairly independent lives into their 60s, 70s and beyond.
Screening for Down’s syndrome
During your pregnancy you’ll be offered a
screening test
to detect if your baby might have Down’s syndrome.
All pregnant women, no matter what age, can be tested.
A
blood test and nuchal translucency (NT) scan
can be used to screen for this condition.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/dry-mouth/,"Dry mouth
It’s normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if you’re dehydrated or feeling nervous. A persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem though.
Contact your dentist or GP if:
You have a dry mouth and:
your mouth is still dry after trying home or pharmacy treatments for a few weeks
you have difficulty chewing, swallowing or talking
you’re struggling to eat regularly
you’re having problems with your sense of taste that are not going away
your mouth is painful, red, swollen or bleeding
you have sore white patches in your mouth
you think a prescribed medicine might be causing your dry mouth
you have other symptoms, like needing to pee a lot or dry eyes
The GP can check what the cause might be and recommend treatment for it.
What can cause a dry mouth?
A dry mouth can happen when the salivary glands in your mouth do not produce enough saliva.
This is often the result of
dehydration
.
This means you do not have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It’s also common for your mouth to become dry if you’re feeling anxious or nervous.
A dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as:
medication – many different medications can cause a dry mouth including
antidepressants
, antihistamines and diuretics
a blocked nose – breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out
diabetes
– a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar level to become too high
radiotherapy
to the head and neck – this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis)
Sjögren’s syndrome
– a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glands
If you contact your dentist or GP, tell them about any other symptoms you’re experiencing. Also tell them about any treatments you’re having. This will help them work out why your mouth is dry.
What problems can a dry mouth cause?
Saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience some other problems, such as:
a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth
dry lips
bad breath (halitosis)
a reduced or altered sense of taste
mouth infections that keep coming back, such as
oral thrush
tooth decay
and
gum disease
difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing
It’s important to maintain good
oral hygiene
if you have a dry mouth. This can reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on.
Treating a dry mouth
If your doctor or dentist is able to find out what’s causing your dry mouth, treating this may help your symptoms.
If medication is suspected as a cause, for example, your doctor may lower your dose or suggest trying a different treatment.
Some of the conditions mentioned have specific treatments, like:
nasal
decongestants
for a blocked nose
insulin for diabetes
Things to try yourself
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.
Do
drink plenty of cold water – take regular sips during the day and keep some water by your bed at night
suck on ice cubes or ice lollies
sip on cold unsweetened drinks
chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free sweets
use lip balm if your lips are also dry
brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash – you’re more likely to get tooth decay if you have a dry mouth
Don’t
do not drink lots of alcohol, caffeine (such as tea and coffee) or fizzy drinks
do not eat foods that are acidic (like lemons), spicy, salty or sugary
do not smoke
do not sleep with dentures in
do not use acidic artificial saliva products if you have your own teeth
do not stop taking a prescribed medicine without getting medical advice first – even if you think it might be causing your symptoms
Saliva substitutes and stimulants
If the measures above don’t help, your dentist, GP or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute. An artificial saliva substitute will help keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals.
If your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or Sjögren’s syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day. It helps to stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva."

About dysphagia
Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties.
Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can’t swallow at all.
Other signs of dysphagia include:
coughing
or choking when eating or drinking
bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose
a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest
persistent drooling of saliva
Over time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections.
You should see your GP if you have swallowing difficulties.
What causes dysphagia?
Dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as:
a condition that affects the nervous system, such as a
stroke
,
head injury
, or
dementia
cancer
– such as
mouth cancer
or
oesophageal cancer
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus
Dysphagia can also occur in children as the result of a developmental or learning disability.
Dysphagia can be caused by problems with the:
mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or ‘high’ dysphagia
oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or ‘low’ dysphagia
Read more about the
causes of dysphagia
.
Treating dysphagia
Treatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus.
Many cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn’t always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include:
speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques
changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow
alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach
surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent)
Read more about
diagnosing dysphagia
and
treating dysphagia
.
Complications of dysphagia
Dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the ‘wrong way’ and blocks your airway.
If this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead to
malnutrition
and
dehydration
.
Some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration
pneumonia
, which require medical treatment.
Dysphagia can also affect your quality of life as it may prevent you enjoying meals and social occasions.
Read more about the
complications of dysphagia
.
Causes of dysphagia
As swallowing is a complex process, there are many reasons why dysphagia can develop.
Neurological causes
The nervous system is made up of the brain, nerves and spinal cord. Damage to the nervous system can interfere with the nerves responsible for starting and controlling swallowing. This can lead to dysphagia.
Some neurological causes of dysphagia include:
a
stroke
neurological conditions that cause damage to the brain and nervous system over time, including
Parkinson’s disease
,
multiple sclerosis
,
dementia
, and
motor neurone disease
brain tumours
myasthenia gravis
– a rare condition that causes your muscles to become weak
Congenital and developmental conditions
The term ‘congenital’ refers to something you’re born with. Developmental conditions affect the way you develop.
Congenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include:
learning disabilities – where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult
cerebral palsy – a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination
a cleft lip and palate – a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth
Obstruction
Conditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach) can make swallowing difficult.
Some causes of obstruction and narrowing include:
mouth cancer
or throat cancer, such as
laryngeal cancer
or
oesophageal cancer
– once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue
pharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as Zenker diverticulum – where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids; it’s a rare condition that mainly affects older people
eosinophilic oesophagitis – where a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the oesophagus as the result of a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux; the build-up damages the lining of the oesophagus and causes swallowing difficulties
radiotherapy
treatment – this can cause scar tissue, which narrows the passageway in your throat and oesophagus
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus
infections, such as
tuberculosis
or
thrush
– these can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis)
Muscular conditions
Any condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia, although such conditions are rare.
2 muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are:
scleroderma – where the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles
achalasia – where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomach
Other causes
As you get older, the muscles used for swallowing can become weaker. This may explain why dysphagia is relatively common in elderly people. Treatment is available to help people with age-related dysphagia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. Breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow.
Dysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck surgery.
Diagnosing dysphagia
See your GP if you’re having any difficulty swallowing. They’ll carry out an initial assessment and may refer you for further tests and treatment.
Tests will help determine whether your dysphagia is the result of a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or ‘high’ dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or ‘low’ dysphagia).
Diagnosing the specific type of dysphagia can make treatment more effective and reduce your chances of developing
complications of dysphagia
, such as choking or
pneumonia
.
Your GP will want to know:
how long you’ve had dysphagia
whether your symptoms come and go, or are getting worse
whether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both
whether you’ve lost weight
Specialist referral
Depending on the suspected cause, you may be referred for further tests with:
an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist
a speech and language therapist (SLT)
a neurologist – a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord
a gastroenterologist – a specialist in treating conditions of the gullet, stomach, and intestines
a geriatrician – a specialist in the care of elderly people
Water swallow test
A water swallow test is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and can give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. You’ll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible.
The time it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. You may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit.
Videofluoroscopy
A videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is.
An
X-ray
machine records a continuous moving X-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail.
You’ll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on X-rays.
A videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. You may feel sick after the test, and the barium may cause
constipation
. Your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system.
Nasoendoscopy
A nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope.
The endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. It has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. This allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified.
FEES can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you’re asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk).
Before the procedure, you may have
local anaesthetic
spray into your nose, but because the camera doesn’t go as far as your throat, it doesn’t cause retching. The procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes.
Manometry and 24-hour pH study
Manometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. It involves passing a small tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function.
The test measures the pressures within your oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it’s working.
The 24-hour pH study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach. This can help determine the cause of any swallowing difficulties.
Diagnostic gastroscopy
Diagnostic gastroscopy, also known as diagnostic endoscopy of the stomach, or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), is an internal examination using an endoscope.
The endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. It can often detect cancerous growths or scar tissue.

Nutritional assessment
If dysphagia has affected your ability to eat, you may need a nutritional assessment to check that you’re not lacking nutrients
(malnourished)
. This could involve:
measuring your weight
calculating your
body mass index (BMI)
to check whether you’re a healthy weight for your height
carrying out
blood tests
Treating dysphagia
Most swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment you receive will depend on the type of dysphagia you have.
Treatment will depend on whether your swallowing problem is in the mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or ‘high’ dysphagia), or in the oesophagus (oesophageal, or ‘low’ dysphagia).
The cause of dysphagia is also considered when deciding on treatment. In some cases, treating the underlying cause, such as
mouth cancer
or
oesophageal cancer
, can help relieve swallowing problems.
Treatment for dysphagia may be managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT may include a speech and language therapist (SLT), a surgeon, and a dietitian.
High (oropharyngeal) dysphagia
High dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat.
It can be difficult to treat if it’s caused by a condition that affects the nervous system. This is because these problems can’t usually be corrected using medication or surgery.
There are 3 main treatments for high dysphagia:
swallowing therapy
dietary changes
feeding tubes
Swallowing therapy
You may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia.
An SLT is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties.
SLTs use a range of techniques that can be tailored for your specific problem, such as teaching you swallowing exercises.
Dietary changes
You may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) for advice about changes to your diet to make sure you receive a healthy, balanced diet.
An SLT can give you advice about softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. They may also try to ensure you’re getting the support you need at meal times.
Feeding tubes
Feeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you’re recovering your ability to swallow. They may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk of
malnutrition
and
dehydration
.
A feeding tube can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions.
There are 2 types of feeding tubes:
a nasogastric tube – a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach
a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube – a tube that is implanted directly into your stomach
Nasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. The tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. PEG tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced.
Most people with dysphagia prefer to use a PEG tube because it can be hidden under clothing. However, they carry a greater risk of complications compared with nasogastric tubes.
Minor complications of PEG tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2 major complications of PEG tubes are infection and internal bleeding.
Resuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a PEG tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. The convenience of PEG tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who use nasogastric tubes.
You should discuss the pros and cons of both types of feeding tubes with your treatment team.
Low (oesophageal) dysphagia
Low dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the oesophagus.
Medication
Depending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat
indigestion
may improve symptoms caused by narrowing or scarring of the oesophagus.
Botulinum toxin
Botulinum toxin can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. This is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach.
It can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. However, the effects only last for around 6 months.
Surgery
Other cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery.
Endoscopic dilatation
Endoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. It can also be used to stretch your oesophagus if it’s scarred.
Endoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy) using an endoscopy.
An endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen.
Using the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. If a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed.
You may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. There’s a small risk that the procedure could cause a tear or perforate your oesophagus.
Inserting a stent
If you have
oesophageal cancer
that can’t be removed, it’s usually recommended that you have a stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. This is because, if you have cancer, there’s a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it’s stretched.
A stent (usually a metal mesh tube) is inserted into your oesophagus during an endoscopy or under
X-ray
guidance.
The stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. You’ll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having blockages.
Congenital dysphagia
If your baby is born with difficulty swallowing (congenital dysphagia), their treatment will depend on the cause.
Cerebral palsy
Dysphagia caused by cerebral palsy can be treated with speech and language therapy. Your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes.
Cleft lip and palate
Cleft lip and palate is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. It’s usually treated with surgery.
Narrowing of the oesophagus
Narrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus.
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Dysphagia caused by
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. Sometimes medication may also be used.
Breastfeeding or bottle feeding
If you’re having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby, see your midwife, health visitor or GP.
Complications of dysphagia
The main complication of dysphagia is coughing and choking, which can lead to pneumonia.
Coughing and choking
If you have dysphagia, there’s a risk of food, drink or saliva going down the ‘wrong way’. It can block your airway, making it difficult to breathe and causing you to cough or choke.
Read more information and advice about
what to do if someone is choking
.
If you have dysphagia, you may also develop a fear of choking. However, it’s very important you don’t avoid eating and drinking, as it could cause
dehydration
and
malnutrition
.
If you often choke on your food because of dysphagia, you may also be at an increased risk of developing a condition called aspiration
pneumonia
.
Aspiration pneumonia
Aspiration pneumonia is a chest infection that can develop after accidentally inhaling something, such as a small piece of food. It causes irritation in the lungs, or damages them. Older people are particularly at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
The symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include:
a cough – this may be a dry cough, or you may produce phlegm that’s yellow, green, brown, or bloodstained
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or over
chest pain
difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow and you may feel breathless, even at rest
Contact your treatment team immediately if you’re being treated for dysphagia and you develop these symptoms. If this isn’t possible, contact your local
out-of-hours service
or phone
NHS 24 111 service
.
Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and it is usually treated with
antibiotics
. Severe cases will require hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics (through a drip). Read more about
treating pneumonia
.
In particularly old or frail people, there’s a chance the infection could lead to their lungs becoming filled with fluid, preventing them working properly. This is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Your chances of developing pneumonia as a result of dysphagia are higher if you have a weakened immune system,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
, or if your oral and
dental hygiene
is poor.
Dysphagia in children
If children with long-term dysphagia aren’t eating enough, they may not get the essential nutrients they need for physical and mental development.
Children who have difficulty eating may also find meal times stressful, which may lead to behavioural problems."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/dystonia/,"Dystonia
Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder. People with dystonia experience involuntary muscle spasms and contractions.
Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) is often associated with some types of dystonia.
Dystonia can be a condition on its own (primary dystonia). Some people experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition (secondary dystonia).
Symptoms of dystonia
Symptoms of dystonia can include:
uncontrolled muscle spasms
parts of your body twisting into unusual positions – like your neck being pulled to the side or your feet turning inwards
shaking (tremors)
excessive blinking
The symptoms may be continuous or come and go. They may be triggered by voluntary movements.
Types of dystonia
There are different types of dystonia.
Generalised dystonia
Generalised dystonia affects all parts of the body.
Focal dystonia
If you have focal dystonia, only one muscle group is affected.
The most common type of focal dystonia is neck dystonia, also known as cervical dystonia. This usually causes the head to be pulled in one direction. This can then affect movement and cause pain.
Other types of focal dystonia can impact:
your voice (laryngeal dystonia)
the muscles around your eyes (blepharospasm)
limbs (like writer’s cramp)
Causes of dystonia
Dystonia is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls movement.
Primary and secondary dystonia may have different underlying causes.
Causes of primary dystonia
Primary dystonia often begins in childhood. This type of dystonia is more likely to have a recognised genetic cause.
Causes of secondary dystonia
You might experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition.
Secondary dystonia might be caused by:
Parkinson’s disease
cerebral palsy
certain medications (like some antipsychotics and some anti sickness medications)
injury to the brain
stroke
Diagnosing dystonia
If your GP thinks you have dystonia, they may refer you to a specialist neurologist.
You may need to have tests to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia.
Depending on your symptoms, you might have a blood test or scan.
Treating dystonia
There are treatments that can control the involuntary movements and spasms of dystonia.
You might need to try several treatment options to find out which one works best.
Botulinum toxin
If you have focal dystonia, you might be offered botulinum toxin.
Botulinum toxin is injected into the affected muscles. It blocks the neurotransmitters within the nerve, reducing muscle spasms.
The effects of the injection can last from around 3 months to 6 months.
Medication
Oral medications, like tablets, can be effective for some people with generalised dystonia.
The following are medications which might be used to treat dystonia:
anticholinergics
baclofen
muscle relaxants
Physiotherapy
Depending on the type of dystonia you have, physiotherapy might help you improve your range of movement.
Surgery
You might have surgery if your dystonia symptoms don’t improve with other treatments.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS)
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a type of brain surgery. It’s offered to some people with dystonia where other treatments haven’t been successful.
The surgeon will place a small device, like a pacemaker, under the skin of your chest or tummy.
The device sends electrical signals along wires placed in the part of the brain that controls movement.
It’ll be several weeks or months before you begin to feel the benefit of DBS.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/earwax-build-up/,"Earwax build-up
Earwax is made inside your ears to keep them clean. It usually falls out on its own. Sometimes too much can build up and block the ears.
A build-up of earwax is a common problem. It can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy.
Symptoms of an earwax build-up
A build-up of earwax in your ear can cause:
earache
hearing loss
tinnitus
(hearing sounds from inside your body)
itchiness
in or around the ear
ear infections
These problems will usually get better once the build up of earwax has been removed.
What to do if you think your ear is blocked
Do not try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down.
Try eardrops
If the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy. Using drops may make your hearing or symptoms a little worse at first before getting better. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally.
There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing:
sodium bicarbonate
olive oil
almond oil
Eardrops aren’t suitable for everyone and some can irritate the skin. You shouldn’t use eardrops if you have a hole or tear in your eardrum.
Speak to your pharmacist about the right product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Speak to your GP practice if:
you’re worried about your symptoms
eardrops haven’t helped after 1 week
Diagnosing earwax build up
Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they’re blocked. They might carry out some simple hearing tests.
Treatments to remove earwax
If pharmacy treatment doesn’t work, speak to your GP practice.
Treatments may include:
ear irrigation – a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out
microsuction – a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear (you may need to be referred for this)
These treatments are not suitable for everyone. Your doctor can discuss this with you.
If these treatments don’t help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
What causes a build up of earwax?
Some people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax.
Other causes include:
producing naturally hard or dry earwax
having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum)
being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age
bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal
Earwax can also block your ear if you often insert objects into your ear, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or hearing aids."

About discoid eczema
Discoid eczema is a long-term skin condition that causes skin to become itchy, reddened, swollen and cracked in circular or oval patches.
It’s also known as discoid dermatitis.
The patches can be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in size and can affect any part of the body, although they don’t usually affect the face or scalp.
The patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time.
The patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur.

Seeking medical advice
You should see your pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema.
Your GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions.
Your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a doctor who specialises in managing skin conditions) if they are unsure of the diagnosis or if you need patch testing.
Your GP or specialist can recommend suitable treatments.
What causes discoid eczema?
The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought to be triggered by irritation of the skin.
Discoid eczema tends to affect adults and is rare in children. It is more common among men aged from 50 to 70 and women in their teens or twenties.
Some people with discoid eczema may also have other types of eczema, such as
atopic eczema
.
Read more about the
causes of discoid eczema
.
How discoid eczema is treated
Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medications are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control.
Treatments used include:
emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry
topical corticosteroids
– ointments and creams applied to the skin that can help relieve severe symptoms
antihistamines – medications that can reduce itching and help you sleep better
There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels.
Additional medication can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe.
Read more about
treating discoid eczema
.
Symptoms of discoid eczema
Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema.
The patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the:
lower legs
forearms
trunk (torso)
hands
feet
The face and scalp are not normally affected.
The first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.
Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.
Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for
ringworm
.
You may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry.
Patches of discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can keeping recurring – often in the same area that was affected previously.
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up.
Discoid eczema can occur anywhere on the body, including the ankles.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Signs of an infection
Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include:
the patches oozing a lot of fluid
a yellow crust developing over the patches
the skin around the patches becoming red, hot, swollen, and tender or painful
feeling sick
chills
a general sense of feeling unwell
When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP or pharmacist if you think you may have discoid eczema, as the condition can take a long time to improve without treatment and it may keep recurring.
You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected, as you may need to use
antibiotic
cream or, in very severe cases, take antibiotics tablets.
Read more about
diagnosing discoid eczema
.
Causes of discoid eczema
The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin.
Dry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin.
It’s important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin.
Contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema.
Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of
atopic eczema
, which often occurs in people who are prone to
asthma
and
hay fever
. However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.
Other possible triggers
An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an
insect bite
or a
burn
.
Some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking:
interferon and ribavirin – when they are used together to treat
hepatitis C
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers – which are used to treat some types of
arthritis
statins
(cholesterol-lowering medication), which can cause dry skin and rashes
Dry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse and sunny or humid (damp) environments may make your symptoms better.
Treating discoid eczema
There is no simple cure for discoid eczema, but there are medications that can help ease the symptoms.
These include:
emollients – to use all the time
soap substitutes – to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products
topical corticosteroids
– for flare-ups
oral corticosteroids
– for severe flare-ups
antibiotics
– for infected eczema
antihistamines – for severe itching
There are many different preparations for each type of medication and it is worth taking time with your pharmacist to find the best one for you.
A range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription.
Ask your pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See your GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation.
Self-help
There are also some self-help tips that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as:
avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes – even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; you should use an emollient soap substitute instead
protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as they may trigger discoid eczema
taking daily lukewarm baths or showers – using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards
not scratching the patches – keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching
making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your GP or pharmacist
If you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your GP. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.
Emollients
Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.
Choice of emollient
Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:
an ointment for very dry skin
a cream or lotion for less dry skin
an emollient to use instead of soap
an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower
one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body
The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.
Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed.
If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product.
How to use emollients
Use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms as they can help limit the return of your condition. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school.
To apply the emollient:
use a large amount
don’t rub it in, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows instead
for very dry skin, apply the emollient every two to three hours
after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist
If you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work.
Don’t share emollients with other people.
Side effects
Occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP, who can recommend an alternative product.
Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.
Topical corticosteroids
To treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation.
You may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. However, corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes. When used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for discoid eczema.
Choice of topical corticosteroid
There are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema.
You might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups.
How to use topical corticosteroids
When using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, you should follow directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the corticosteroid.
Do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people will only have to apply it once a day.
To apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps:
apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin
apply a good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area
use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your GP
Speak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.
Side effects
Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause:
thinning of the skin
changes in skin colour
acne
(spots)
increased hair growth
Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.
Generally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount of topical corticosteroid, will increase your risk of getting side effects. For this reason, you should use the weakest and smallest amount possible to control your symptoms.
Corticosteroid tablets
If you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week.
If corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as:
reduced growth rate in children
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
osteoporosis
(brittle bones)
diabetes
For this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist.
Antibiotics
If your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic.
Oral antibiotics
If you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin.
Topical antibiotics
If you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. This means the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream.
Some topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids.
Topical antibiotics should normally be used for up to 2 weeks as necessary.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines are a type of medicine that work by stopping the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching.
Antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin.
Many older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask your pharmacist or GP to recommend one of the more modern “non-sedating” antihistamines.
Further treatments
If the treatments prescribed by your GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a dermatologist (specialist in treating skin conditions).
Further treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include:
phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation
bandaging – where medicated dressings are applied to your skin
immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system"

What causes diarrhoea?
There are many different causes of diarrhoea. A bowel infection (
gastroenteritis
) is a common cause in both adults and children.
Gastroenteritis can be caused by:
a virus – such as
norovirus
or rotavirus
bacteria – such as campylobacter and Escherichia (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food
a parasite – such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water
These infections can sometimes be caught during travelling abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers’ diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a
food allergy
, medication, or a long-term condition, such as
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
.
What to do if you have diarrhoea
Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment.
You should drink plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
. Drink small sips of water often. It’s very important that babies and children do not become dehydrated.
Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or you child are particularly at risk of dehydration.
You should eat solid foods as soon as you feel able to. If you’re breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal.
Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others.
Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary. Most types of medication should not be given to children
Preventing diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene.
Do
wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food
clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each episode of diarrhoea
avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members
avoid potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food when travelling abroad"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/epilepsy/,"Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures.
Epilepsy affects more than 600,000 people in the UK. Almost one in every 100 people has the condition.
Symptoms of epilepsy
The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.
The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.
The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).
Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.
Types of seizures
People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.
Seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep.
The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:
focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected
generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected
Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.
Focal seizures
There are two main types of focal seizure.
Focal aware seizures
Focal aware seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout.
Symptoms of a focal aware seizure can include:
a general strange feeling that is hard to describe
a “rising” feeling in your tummy – sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride
an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)
experiencing an unusual smell or taste
a tingling sensation, or “pins and needles”, in your arms and legs
a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy
stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand
These seizures are sometimes known as “warnings” or “auras”, because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you’re in a safe place.
Focal impaired awareness seizures
Focal impaired awareness seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness. You won’t remember what happened after this type of seizure.
The symptoms of a focal impaired awareness seizure can involve random bodily behaviour, like:
smacking your lips
rubbing your hands
making random noises
moving your arms around
picking at clothes
fiddling with objects
adopting an unusual posture
chewing or swallowing
During a focal impaired awareness seizure, you’ll not be able to respond to anyone else. You’ll usually have no memory of it.
Generalised seizures
There are 6 main types of generalised seizure.
Absences
Absence seizures mainly affect children, but they also occur in adults. They cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. The person will seem to stare vacantly into space. Some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The person will have no memory of the seizure.
Absences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child’s performance at school. They can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road.
Myoclonic seizures
These types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you’ll normally remain conscious during this time.
Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. They can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures.
Clonic seizures
These cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to 2 minutes. You might lose consciousness during a clonic seizure.
Atonic seizures
Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. There’s a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself.
Tonic seizures
Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. You might lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there’s a risk of injury.
Tonic-clonic seizures
Tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You’ll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer.
This type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit.
Myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.
What to do if someone has a seizure
If you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure.
Phone 999 if:
the seizure has not stopped after 5 minutes
the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between
you know it’s the person’s first seizure
the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason
the person’s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe
If you’re with someone who has a seizure:
protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby
cushion their head with your hands or soft material
do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger)
don’t put anything in their mouth
stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness
When the convulsions have stopped, put them into the
recovery position
until they’ve recovered.
Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.
You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. It’s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.
If you’ve been trained to treat the condition, you’ll usually have been advised to use either:
a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person’s cheek or up their nose (this is the most common immediate treatment)
a medication called diazepam that’s placed in the person’s rectum (less commonly used)
If you’ve tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, phone 999 for an ambulance.
Causes of epilepsy
In some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found.
If there’s an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition.
The brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures.
The categories of epilepsy can be separated by their causes which might be:
Structural
Causes of structural epilepsy can include:
cerebrovascular disease (problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain) – such as a
stroke
or subarachnoid haemorrhage
brain tumours
severe head injuries
Genetic
A genetic abnormality can cause epilepsy. Research has found more genetic causes of epilepsy.
Sometimes epilepsy is hereditary (passed on from one or both parents) or it can be a new gene abnormality.
Infectious
Infections like
meningitis
can cause damage to the brain which can result in epilepsy. Viral infections like HIV can also cause epilepsy.
Metabolic
Sometimes epilepsy is caused by an imbalance of the bodies chemicals. This is very rare.
Immune
Autoimmune conditions that cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can cause someone to develop epilepsy.
Unknown
In many cases, no cause of epilepsy is found. This may be because medical investigations are not advanced enough to identify the cause.
Seizure triggers
For many people with epilepsy, seizures can occur without any obvious trigger. However, certain circumstances or the use of certain substances can sometimes come before a seizure. These include:
stress
lack of sleep
withdrawal from alcohol following heavy drinking
some medications
illegal drugs
your
menstrual cycle or period
flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger that affects less than 5% of people with epilepsy, and is known as photosensitive epilepsy)
Keeping a seizure diary is a good way to help find out what might trigger your seizures. Every time you have a seizure, record it and make a note of what you were doing. Over time, you might notice some avoidable things that seem to trigger your symptoms.
Diagnosing epilepsy
Epilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. In most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure.
It can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, like fainting,
migraines
and
panic attacks
, can cause similar symptoms.
If you’ve had a seizure, you’ll be referred to a specialist in epilepsy. This will normally be a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).
Describing your seizures
Some of the most important pieces of information needed to diagnose epilepsy are the details about your seizures.
The doctor will ask you what you can remember and any symptoms you may have had before it happened – things like feeling strange before the seizure or experiencing any warning signs. It is extremely useful to talk to anyone who seen your seizure and ask them exactly what they saw, especially if you cannot remember.
The doctor will also ask about your medical and personal history. They’ll ask whether you use any medicines, drugs or alcohol.
The doctor may be able to make a diagnosis of epilepsy from the information you give. They might run further tests like an electroencephalogram (EEG) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
Even if these tests don’t show anything, it’s still possible that you have epilepsy based on your symptoms and description of your seizures.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
An
MRI scan
is a type of scan which uses strong magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the inside of your body.
It can be useful in cases of suspected epilepsy. It can often detect possible causes of the condition, such as defects in the structure of your brain.
Electroencephalogram (EEG)
An EEG test can detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. It measures the electrical activity of your brain through electrodes placed on your scalp.
During the test, you may be asked to breathe deeply or close your eyes and you may be asked to look at a flashing light. The test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.
In some cases, an EEG may be carried out while you’re asleep (sleep EEG). Or you may be given a small, portable EEG recording device to monitor your brain activity over 24 hours (ambulatory EEG).
You might be asked to come into the hospital for a few days to have a video telemetry and EEG. During this, an EEG and video will be used to monitor you.
Treating epilepsy
Most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring.
There are many different ASMs. They work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. This reduces the chance of a seizure.
The type of ASM recommended for you will depend on a number of factors like:
the type of seizures you have
your age
whether there are any concerns about a certain ASM interacting with other medicines (like the
contraceptive pill
)
whether you’re thinking of having a baby
Examples of commonly used ASMs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam.
Taking ASMs
ASMs are available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids and syrups.
It’s important you follow any advice about when to take ASMs and how much to take. Never suddenly stop taking an ASM because it could cause a seizure.
You shouldn’t take any other medicines whilst taking ASMs without speaking to your GP or epilepsy specialist. This includes over-the-counter medicines or complementary medicines such as St John’s Wort. Other medicines could have a dangerous interaction with your ASM and cause a seizure.
Sodium valproate is not usually prescribed for women of childbearing age. This is because it could cause a baby to have physical defects or developmental problems.
It can be used if there is no alternative, or if your specialist has assessed you and it’s unlikely you’ll respond to or tolerate other treatments. Your specialist or GP will also need to check you’re using a reliable form of contraception. Learn more about the
risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy
.
Side effects are common when starting treatment with ASMs. They’re usually short-lived and pass in a few days.
Speak to your healthcare team for more information on the side effects.
Brain surgery
If your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with ASMs, you may be referred to a specialist epilepsy centre. They’ll assess if you’re suitable for surgery.
This involves having various types of brain scans to find out where the epilepsy is focused. Memory and psychological tests will assess how the surgery might affect you.
Surgery is only recommended when:
a single area of the brain is causing seizures (focal seizures)
removing that part of the brain would not cause any significant loss of brain function
Most people recover from the effects of surgery after a few days. But it could be several months before you’re feeling fit and able to return to work.
Alternative procedures
Your doctor might suggest an alternative procedure if:
your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with ASMs
brain surgery is not suitable for you
This might be vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
VNS involves surgically implanting a small electrical device under your skin, near your collarbone. The device is like a
pacemaker
.
The device has a wire that’s wrapped around one of the nerves in the left side of your neck, known as the vagus nerve. The device passes a regular dose of electricity to the nerve to stimulate it. This can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.
If you feel the warning sign of a seizure coming on, you can activate an extra “burst” of stimulation. This might prevent the seizure from occurring. The stimulation normally occurs every five minutes and lasts for 30 seconds.
How and why VNS works is not fully understood. It’s thought that stimulating the vagus nerve alters the chemical transmissions in the brain.
Most people who undergo VNS still need to take ASMs.
The battery for the VNS device typically lasts up to 10 years. After 10 years you’ll need another procedure to replace it.
Ketogenic diet
A ketogenic diet is a diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates and protein. It’s thought that it may make seizures less likely by altering the chemical composition of the brain.
A ketogenic diet is sometimes advised for children with seizures that are difficult to control and have not responded to ASMs. This is because it’s reduces the number of seizures in some children. It should only be used under the supervision of an epilepsy specialist with the help of a dietitian.
It can also be effective in adults with certain types of epilepsy.
Living with epilepsy
Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone. They can help prevent many conditions, including
heart disease
and many forms of
cancer
.
Try to eat a balanced diet, containing all the food groups, to give your body the nutrition it needs. Exercising regularly can increase the strength of your bones, relieve stress and reduce fatigue.
Drinking
Alcohol can also interact with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs can heighten the effects of alcohol. Alcohol also can make the side effects of ASMs worse and make the medication less effective.
Heavy drinking can disrupt your sleep patterns. This increases your chances of having a seizure. Drinking no more than the
recommended daily limits
may help reduce this risk.
Read more about drinking and alcohol
Contraception
Some anti-seizure medication (ASMs) can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception. This includes:
contraceptive injections
contraceptive patches
the combined oral contraceptive pill
– often known as ‘the pill’
the
progesterone-only pill (POP)
or ‘mini pill’
contraceptive implants
If you’re sexually active and do not want to become pregnant, ask your GP or epilepsy specialist if your ASMs could affect your contraception.
You may need to ensure you or your partner use another form of contraception like a
condom
or
intrauterine device (IUD)
.
The effectiveness of the ASM lamotrigine may be reduced if you’re taking the combined oral contraceptive pill.
Some ASMs can make the emergency contraceptive pill less effective. If you need emergency contraception, you may need an IUD. Your GP, family planning clinic or pharmacist should be able to help you.
Pregnancy
There’s no reason why women with epilepsy cannot have a healthy pregnancy.
It’s better if the pregnancy is planned because there’s a slightly higher risk of complications. With forward planning, you can minimise these risks.
The main risk is that some ASMs increase the chances of a serious birth defect, like spina bifida, cleft lip or
congenital heart disease
. The risks depend on the type of ASM and the dose you’re taking.
The
UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register
can provide more information and advice about the use of ASMs during pregnancy.
If you’re planning a pregnancy, talk to your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to change the ASM you’re taking to minimise risks. Taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of a folic acid supplement each day can also help reduce risks of birth defects. You might be recommended to take more than this by your healthcare team.
If you discover you’re pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine. The risks to your baby from uncontrolled seizures are far higher than any risks associated with your medicines.
If you’re breastfeeding or planned to breastfeed, discuss the medication you’re taking with your healthcare team or midwife.
Children and epilepsy
Many children with well-controlled epilepsy can learn and take part in their school’s activities unaffected by their condition. Others may need extra support to get the most out of their time at school.
Make sure your child’s teachers know about their condition and the medication they need to control it.
Epilepsy is more common among children with learning disabilities and special educational needs. These children are entitled to extra help to overcome their difficulties.
Driving
You must tell the Driving and Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) if you’ve had any epileptic seizures or blackouts. You must stop driving right away. If you ignore these regulations, you might be prosecuted.
The DVLA may wish to contact your GP or epilepsy specialist.
The DVLA may issue a licence if your seizures have never caused you to lose awareness or affected your ability to safely control a vehicle.
Your GP has a legal responsibility to inform the DVLA if they feel that your driving is putting both you and others at risk.
Read about epilepsy and driving on the DVLA website
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)
When somebody with epilepsy dies and there’s no clear cause, it’s known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
The risk of SUDEP for someone with epilepsy is low.
The exact causes of SUDEP are unknown. It’s not possible to predict who it will affect. One theory is that seizures could affect the person’s breathing and heartbeat.
Things that may lead to SUDEP include:
having seizures which cause loss of consciousness and the body to go stiff and jerk (tonic-clonic seizures)
poorly controlled epilepsy, such as not using ASMs prescribed to control seizures
having sudden and frequent changes to ASMs
being a young adult (in particular male)
having sleep seizures
having seizures when alone
drinking large amounts of alcohol
If you’re worried that your epilepsy is poorly controlled, contact your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to refer you to a specialist epilepsy centre for further treatment.
A charity called
SUDEP Action
can offer advice and support on SUDEP. They have a helpline for people who have lost a loved one as a result of epilepsy."

About diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon).
In diverticular disease, small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets become inflamed or infected.
Symptoms of diverticular disease include:
lower abdominal pain
feeling bloated
The majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis.
Symptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include:
more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements
Read more about the
symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis
.
Diverticulosis, diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Diverticula
‘Diverticula’ is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon).
Diverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine is thought to cause the bulges to form.
Read more about the
causes of diverticula
.
It’s estimated that 5% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old.
Diverticular disease
1 in 4 people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain.
Having symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease.
Diverticulitis
Diverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms.
Diverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to the intestine.
Read more about the
complications of diverticulitis
.
Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis
A
high-fibre diet
can often ease symptoms of diverticular disease, and
paracetamol
can be used to relieve pain – other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working.
Mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with
antibiotics
prescribed by your GP. More serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications.
Surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare.
Read more about
treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis
.
Who is affected
Diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions.
Both sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old.
Diverticular disease is often described as a ‘Western disease’ because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries.
A combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to eat less fibre.
People aged 50 to 70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease – compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.
Symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits.
Diverticulosis
If diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means.
However, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70% to 80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them.
Diverticula are extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer. It’s thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.
Diverticular disease
The most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side.
The pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help relieve the pain.
Other long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include:
a change in your normal bowel habits, such as
constipation
or
diarrhoea
, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like ‘rabbit pellets’
bloating
Another possible symptom of diverticular disease is bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is an uncommon complication.
Diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP.
Diverticulitis
Diverticulitis shares most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). However, the pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. It is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2.
Other symptoms of diverticulitis can include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a general feeling of being tired and unwell
feeling sick (nausea) or
being sick
(vomiting)
The pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.
In Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons.
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis.
If you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP as the symptoms can be treated at home.

treatment of diverticular disease
.
If you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your GP so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:
a
stomach ulcer
pancreatitis
cholecystitis
bowel cancer
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.
Causes of diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Diverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. If any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis.
The exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but they are associated with not eating enough fibre.
Fibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body.
The pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer (mucosa) to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula.
There is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. However, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in Western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre.
Diverticular disease
It is not known why only 1 in 4 people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. Diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. The symptoms are very similar to
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
and may overlap.
However, factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include:
smoking
being overweight or
obese
having a history of
constipation
use of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
painkillers, such as
ibuprofen
or naproxen
having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50
Exactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear.
Diverticulitis
Diverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula.
It is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.
Diagnosing diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Diverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
.
As a first step, your GP may recommend
blood tests
to rule out other conditions such as
coeliac disease
(a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or
bowel cancer
.
In some cases, you may be offered treatment for IBS and diverticular disease at the same time.
Colonoscopy
To make sure there is not a more serious cause of your symptoms, your GP may refer you for a colonoscopy, where a thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is inserted into your rectum and guided into your colon. Before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels.
A colonoscopy is not usually painful, but it can feel uncomfortable. You may be offered painkilling medication and a sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help reduce any discomfort.
CT pneumocolon or colonography
Another technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a
computerised tomography (CT scan)
. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.
As with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the CT scan.
Unlike a regular CT scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to pump some air up into your rectum. The CT scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back.
You may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary.
Diverticulitis
If you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your GP will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a physical examination. A blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. If your symptoms are mild, your GP will treat it at home and you should recover within 4 days.
Further tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease.
If you are unwell, your GP may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. This is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia.
An
ultrasound scan
may be used, as well as a CT scan.
A CT scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. This is to check whether a complication, such as a perforation or an abscess, has occurred.
Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Treatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are.
Diverticular disease
Most cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home.
The over-the-counter painkiller
paracetamol
is recommended to help relieve your symptoms.
Painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding.
Eating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. Some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month to feel the benefits fully. Read more advice about
using diet to improve the symptoms of diverticular disease
.
If you have
constipation
, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system.
Heavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in 20 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a
blood transfusion
.
Signs that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include:
feeling very dizzy
mental confusion
pale clammy skin
shortness of breath
If you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP at once. If this is not possible then phone
NHS 24 111 service
or your
local out-of-hours service
.
Diverticulitis
Treatment at home
Mild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe
antibiotics
for the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain. It’s important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better.
Some types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting and
diarrhoea
.
Your GP may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. This is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. You can gradually introduce solid foods over the next 2 or 3 days.
For the 3 to 4 days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. This is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to deal with while it is inflamed.
If you have not been diagnosed with diverticular disease before, your GP may refer you for a test such as a colonoscopy or CT colonography after the symptoms have settled.
Treatment at hospital
If you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if:
your pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol
you are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated
you are unable to take antibiotics by mouth
your general state of health is poor
you have a weakened immune system
your GP suspects complications
your symptoms fail to improve after 2 days of treatment at home
If you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube directly connected to your vein). Most people start to improve within 2 to 3 days.
Surgery
In the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2 episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications.
This is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits.
However, there are exceptions to this, such as:
if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis
if you have symptoms of diverticular disease from a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication)
if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to infections
If surgery is being considered, discuss both benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care.
In rare cases, a severe episode of diverticulitis can only be treated with emergency surgery. This is when a hole (perforation) has developed in the bowel. This is uncommon, but causes very severe abdominal pain, which needs an emergency trip to hospital.
Colectomy
Surgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your large intestine. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2 ways this operation can be performed:
an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your large intestine
laparoscopic colectomy – a type of ‘keyhole surgery’ where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of large intestine
Open colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. People who have laparoscopic colectomies tend to recover faster and have less pain after the operation.
Emergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in a
stoma
being formed.
Stoma surgery (‘having a bag’)
In some cases, the surgeon may decide your large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible.
In such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your large intestine. It is known as ‘having a bag’ as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag.
Stoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen – known as a stoma. There are 2 ways this procedure can be carried out.
An
ileostomy
– where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. Your small intestine is separated from your large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the large intestine is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo).
A
colostomy
– where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material.
In most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your large intestine has recovered from the surgery. This will depend on the situation when you had the operation. If it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma.
If a large section of your large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy.
Results of surgery
In general terms, elective (non-emergency) surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. Following surgery, an estimated 1 in 12 people will have a recurrence of symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.
In an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation.
Complications of diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Complications of diverticulitis affect 1 in 5 people with the condition. Those most at risk are aged under 50.
Bleeding
Around 15% of people with diverticular disease or diverticulitis experience bleeding, which is usually painless, quick and resolves itself in 70% to 80% of cases.
However, if the bleeding does not resolve itself, an emergency
blood transfusion
may be required due to excessive bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to be admitted to hospital for monitoring.
Urinary problems
Diverticulitis can lead to the inflamed part of the bowel being in contact with the bladder. This may cause urinary problems, such as:
pain when urinating (dysuria)
needing to urinate more often than usual
in rare cases, air in the urine
Abscess
The most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). An abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. Abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD).
A radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (CT) scans) uses an ultrasound or CT scanner to locate the site of the abscess.
A fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. The tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. A PAD is performed under a local anaesthetic.
Depending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all the pus has been drained. If the abscess is very small – usually less than 4cm (1.5 inches) – it may be possible to treat it using
antibiotics
.
Fistula
A fistula is another common complication of diverticulitis. Fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2 parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder.
If infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. After the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. Fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (
cystitis
).
Fistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula.
Peritonitis
In rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). An infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis.
Peritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Surgery may also be required to drain any pus that has built up, and it may be necessary to perform a
colostomy
.
Intestinal obstruction
If the infection has badly scarred your large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. A totally blocked large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your large intestine will start to decay and eventually split, leading to peritonitis.
A partially blocked large intestine is not as urgent, but treatment is still needed. If left untreated, it will affect your ability to digest food and cause you considerable pain.
Intestinal blockage from diverticular disease is very rare. Other causes, such as cancer, are more common. This is one of the reasons your GP will investigate your symptoms.
In some cases, the blocked part can be removed during surgery.
However, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanent
colostomy
may be needed.
Preventing diverticular disease and diverticulitis
Eating a high-fibre diet may help prevent diverticular disease, and should improve your symptoms.
Your diet should be balanced and include at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus whole grains. Adults should aim to eat 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight.
It’s recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). Drinking plenty of fluids will also help prevent side effects.
If you have established diverticular disease, it may be suggested that you avoid eating nuts, corn and seeds due to the possibility that they could block the diverticular openings and cause diverticulitis. People usually find out themselves if these foods cause symptoms. Probiotics have also been recommended, but evidence is lacking. Overall, there is a lack of good quality scientific evidence on how to prevent diverticular disease.

Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer.
The 3 main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.
Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old.
Sarcomas
A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body’s supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and
soft tissue sarcomas
are the 2 main types.
Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the:
pelvis bone (hips)
thigh bone (femur)
shin bone (tibia)
However, the condition can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone.
Symptoms of Ewing sarcoma
The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.
The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.
Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.
In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.
What causes Ewing sarcoma?
Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown.
As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones.
The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.
Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.
However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the
risks and causes of bone cancer
.
Diagnosing Ewing sarcoma
When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they’ll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.
Your GP may refer you for an
X-ray
to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).
They may recommend that you have a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
to examine the area in closer detail.
A bone
biopsy
may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a
general anaesthetic
or a
local anaesthetic
.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about
tests for bone cancer
and
the stages of bone cancer
.
Treating Ewing sarcoma
Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.
Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of
chemotherapy
, surgery and radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.
Ewing sarcoma also responds well to
radiotherapy
. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.
In some cases, surgically removing Ewing’s sarcoma can be difficult – for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.
Surgery
If surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on:
the size of the tumour
where it is in your body
whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone
You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection.
Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.
In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (
amputation
). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.
For more information about the
types of treatment for bone cancer
, visit the Cancer Research UK website.
Living with bone cancer
If you’re diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions.
The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure.
However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and
bereavement
.
It’s important to seek help and talk about how you’re feeling. You could talk to your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment.
There are also a number of practical issues you’ll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information on
coping with bone cancer
.
Information about you
If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Earache is a common problem, particularly in children. It can be worrying, but it’s usually only caused by a minor infection and will often get better in a few days without treatment.
Earache can be a sharp, dull or burning ear pain that comes and goes or is constant. One or both ears may be affected.
Earache self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
When to get medical advice
You do not always need to see a GP as earache will usually get better on its own within a few days.
Speak to your pharmacist for advice and treatment if you have earache. Your pharmacist may recommend that you speak to your GP practice if required.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Speak to your GP practice if:
You or your child have earache and:
a high temperature (fever)
vomiting
a severe
sore throat
hearing loss
swelling around the ear
discharge from the ear
there is something stuck in your or your child’s ear
the earache doesn’t improve within a few days
your child is under 2 and has earache in both ears
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
Speak to your GP practice if:
You or your child:
have earache for more than 3 days
keep getting earache
Treatment for earache
Do
ask your pharmacist about using over-the-counter painkillers such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
, or eardrops to treat the pain
place a warm flannel against the affected ear
Don’t
do not use eardrops or olive oil drops if the eardrum has burst
If you or your child has an ear infection, you should avoid putting objects in the ear, such as cotton buds, or getting the affected ear wet.
Common causes of earache
Ear infections
If the cause of earache is an ear infection, there may be a watery or pus-like fluid coming out of the ear.
Outer ear infections
(infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum) and
middle ear infections
(infections of the parts of the ear behind the eardrum) are very common causes of earache.
Many ear infections clear up on their own without treatment in a few days or weeks, but in some cases your GP may prescribe eardrops or
antibiotics
.
Glue ear
Glue ear (also known as otitis media with effusion, or OME) is a build-up of fluid deep inside the ear, which commonly causes some temporary
hearing loss
. The condition tends to be painless, but sometimes the pressure of this fluid can cause earache.
Glue ear will often clear up on its own, although this can take a few months. If the problem is persistent, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended to help drain the fluid.
Read more about
glue ear
Damage to the ear
Earache can sometimes result from injury to the inside of the ear. For example, by scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud, or poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum.
The ear canal is very sensitive and can easily become damaged. The ear should heal on its own without treatment, but it can take up to 2 months for a perforated eardrum to heal. If you have a perforated eardrum, eardrops shouldn’t be used.
Earwax or an object in the ear
A build-up of
earwax
or an object stuck inside the ear can sometimes cause earache.
If there is something in your or your child’s ear that seems be causing pain, don’t attempt to remove it yourself. You may push it further inside and you may damage the eardrum.
If you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally. In some cases, your GP will organise for removal of the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation.
If there is an object in the ear, your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed.
Throat infections
If you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection such as
tonsillitis
or quinsy. Quinsy is an abscess on the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow.
Some types of tonsillitis will clear up after a few days without the need for
antibiotics
. But if you have quinsy, you will need to see your GP as soon as possible for treatment. You may have quinsy if your sore throat gets worse very quickly.
A problem with your jaw
Earache is occasionally caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull). This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can be caused by problems such as
arthritis
or teeth grinding.
Jaw pain can often be treated with painkillers, warm or cold compresses, and trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth.
A dental abscess
A
dental abscess
is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in your affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing, although the pain can sometimes spread to your ear.
If you think you may have a dental abscess, make a dentist appointment as soon as possible. They may need to remove the abscess and drain the pus.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/ectopic-pregnancy/,"Ectopic pregnancy
An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg develops outside the womb.
This usually happens in one of the fallopian tubes which lead from your ovaries to your womb. If an egg implants there, it can’t develop into a baby.
Ectopic pregnancy puts your health at risk too, and can be very serious if it isn’t treated.
About 1 in 100 pregnancies are an ectopic pregnancy.
Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy
Symptoms usually start when you’re about 6 weeks pregnant and can include:
pain low down and on one side of your abdomen
bleeding from your vagina
pain in the tip of your shoulder
discomfort when going to the toilet
a brown watery discharge from your vagina
You might also have:
other more general symptoms such as pale skin and sweating

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/ewing-sarcoma-children/,"Ewing sarcoma: Children
Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. This information describes Ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are now new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Sarcomas
Sarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are 2 main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas.
Bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones.
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body.
Ewing sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column).
It usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys.
Although Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. This is called extraosseous Ewing sarcoma. Another type of Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). These can be found in either the bone or soft tissue.
Causes
The exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. The development of Ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. Like other cancers, it’s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.
Signs and symptoms
Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss.
How Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed
Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an X-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest X-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (
biopsy
). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy. An MRI or CT scan may also be done.
Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.
Treatment
A combination of various treatments is used to treat Ewing sarcoma. These include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.
This is a very important component of treatment for the majority of children with Ewing sarcoma and can help make surgery more straightforward. A combination of different chemotherapy drugs are given before surgery and continued afterwards in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the sarcoma from spreading. Chemotherapy given in this way is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
Surgery
If surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. The aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. If the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery.
Amputation
Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport.
Limb-sparing surgery
There are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. It may involve:
replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)
replacing the bone with bone taken from another part of the body (a bone graft)
After limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. However, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. This may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. It’s often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. If the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it’s a good option.
Side effects of treatment for Ewing sarcoma
Treatment often causes
side effects
. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the actual treatment being used and the part of the body that’s being treated.
Side effects can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
hair loss
increased risk of infection
bruising and bleeding
tiredness
diarrhoea
Radiotherapy
can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Your child will have regular follow-up appointments, with x-rays or scans as necessary. Many children with Ewing sarcoma can be cured. Even if the tumour comes back, further treatment may be given successfully. Your child will be checked up on every few months for the first 3 years after treatment and then every 6 months for another 2 years.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor who knows the situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/eye-cancer/,"Eye cancer
There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including:
eye melanoma
squamous cell carcinoma
lymphoma
retinoblastoma
– a childhood cancer
Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts.
This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer.
Symptoms of eye cancer
Eye cancer doesn’t always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.
Symptoms of eye cancer can include:
shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision
blurred vision
a dark patch in your eye that’s getting bigger
partial or total loss of vision
bulging of one eye
a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that’s increasing in size
pain in or around your eye, although this is rare
These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they’re not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it’s important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible.
Melanoma of the eye
Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it’s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.
Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.
It can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.
What causes eye melanoma?
Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
It’s not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:
lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes
white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin
unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you’re more at risk of developing
skin cancer
and eye melanoma
use of sunbeds – there’s some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma
overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma
The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their fifties.
Diagnosing melanoma of the eye
If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment.
If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they’ll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow.
It’s likely you’ll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:
an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities
an
ultrasound scan
of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size
a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour
Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour
(biopsy)
. The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.
Treatments for eye melanoma
Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.
Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.
The main treatments for eye melanoma are:
brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells
external
radiotherapy
– a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells
surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye
removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you’ve lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye
Chemotherapy
is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the
treatment options for eye cancer
and the types of
eye cancer surgery."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/escherichia-coli-e-coli-o157/,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157
Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called VTEC, is a bacterial infection. It can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure.
E. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It’s an uncommon cause of
gastroenteritis
but can be caught by:
eating contaminated food, such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat
– a
lways wash all vegetables, including salad leaves, that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled ‘ready to eat’ (washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely)
touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces
contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food
drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies
swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams
Symptoms of E. coli O157 infection
Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.
People usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.
These symptoms can last up to 2 weeks.
A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years.
Some people become infected but don’t develop symptoms.
Further information about gastroenteritis
Treatment and care at home
There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment.
It’s important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration.
Contact your GP practice if:
you or your child has bloody diarrhoea
Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications.
Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin.
Find out more about
caring for a child with gastroenteritis
and
caring for an adult with gastroenteritis
.
How to prevent E. coli O157 from spreading at home
Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected.
Do
wash your hands thoroughly with soap in running water and dry them completely – use liquid soap and warm water if you can
everyone must wash their hands after contact with an infected person, particularly after handling their clothes or bedding
always wash your hands after going to the toilet or changing babies’ nappies, and before preparing or serving food or eating meals
if you’ve been infected, avoid cooking or preparing food until 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up
wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes in a washing machine at the highest temperature possible (for example 60°C)
wipe down the outside of the washing machine with hot water and detergent after any heavily soiled load
clean toilet seats, toilet flush handles, basin taps, surfaces and toilet door handles at least daily, preferably more often, using hot water and detergent
disinfection sprays and wipes or alcohol-based wipes may be used on toilet seats and other surfaces, but only after any visible soiling has been removed
thick household bleach is highly effective – dilute one part bleach to every 10 parts water for soiled surfaces and one part bleach to every 100 parts water for other hard surfaces
ideally, use heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves and disposable cloths for cleaning
dispose of cloths by placing them in a plastic bag, sealing the neck and placing in household waste
thoroughly wash rubber gloves in hot water and detergent after use, then rinse and allow to dry
deal with any spillage of faeces immediately – clean the soiled area with hot water and detergent using heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves then clean gloves and wash hands thoroughly
Don’t
do not share towels or nappy changing mats
do not clean soiled items in the kitchen
Returning to work or school
Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours.
Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better.
Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school.
If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has.
If you have a child under 5 years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery.
Children under 5 years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/ebola-virus-disease/,"Ebola virus disease
Ebola virus disease is a serious illness that originated in Africa, where a large outbreak occurred in 2014 to 2015. In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over.
The 2014 to 2015 outbreak of Ebola mainly affected 3 countries in west Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of central Africa.
Around 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the
World Health Organization
. This was the largest known outbreak of Ebola.
Is Ebola still a risk?
There’s still a small chance occasional cases of Ebola may occur in Africa as the virus is present in several countries there, but the risk for people travelling to Africa is minimal.
People who remain most at risk are those who care for infected people or handle their blood or fluid, such as hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members.
To find out what the health risks are for an area you’re planning to visit, check the
NHS Fit for Travel destination guide
,
Travel Health Pro country information
or
GOV.UK foreign travel advice
.
The risk of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the UK remains negligible.
Symptoms of Ebola
A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop:
a high temperature (fever)
a
headache
joint and muscle pain
a
sore throat
severe muscle weakness
These symptoms start suddenly between 2 and 21 days after becoming infected.
Diarrhoea
,
vomiting
, a rash,
stomach pain
and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.
What
to do if you become ill
Get medical advice as soon as possible if you become ill while travelling abroad. Phone 111 or contact your GP if you become ill after returning to the UK.
It’s extremely unlikely you have Ebola, but it could be another serious condition such as cholera or
malaria
, so it’s a good idea to get help in case you need tests or treatment.
Always remember to mention your recent travel history, as this will help identify what the problem could be.
Sometimes your doctor may want to take a sample of your blood, urine or stools so it can be checked for any infections.
How
Ebola virus is spread
The Ebola virus is spread in the blood, body fluids or organs of a person or animal with the infection.
For example, it can be spread by:
directly touching the body of someone with the infection who has symptoms or recently died – the virus can survive for several days outside the body
cleaning up body fluids (blood, stools, urine or vomit) or touching the soiled clothing of an infected person
handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used in the care of the infected person
having sex with an infected person without using a condom – studies show traces of Ebola may remain in a man’s semen many months after he has recovered
handling or eating raw or undercooked ‘bushmeat’
Ebola can’t be caught through routine social contact, such as shaking hands, with people who don’t have symptoms.
Treatment
for Ebola
There’s currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola. Potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested.
Any area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care.
Dehydration
is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person’s body fights the infection.
Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment.
Ebola virus disease is sometimes fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they’ll survive.
Preventing
Ebola
Follow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections.
Do
wash your hands frequently using soap and water – use alcohol hand rubs when soap isn’t available
make sure fruit and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them
avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection
Don’t
do not handle dead animals or their raw meat
do not eat ‘bushmeat’

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/chromosomal-conditions/edwards-syndrome/,"Edwards’ syndrome
Edwards’ syndrome (also known as trisomy 18) is a genetic condition that begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and continues to impact their health throughout their life. It’s a rare but serious condition.
In the UK, around 3 in every 10,000 births are affected by Edwards’ syndrome.
What is Edwards’ syndrome?
When a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome.
Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.
If a baby has Edwards’ syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.
There are 3 different forms of Edwards’ syndrome:
Full form
In full form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells.
Around 94% of babies born with Edwards’ syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.
Mosaic form
In mosaic form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells.
Partial form
In partial form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 18. This is a very rare form of Edwards’ syndrome.
Why does Edwards’ syndrome happen?
Most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.
Effects of Edwards’ syndrome on pregnancy
Screening for Edwards’ syndrome
You’ll be offered
screening for Edward’s syndrome
when you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.
The screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Edwards’ syndrome.
If screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has Edwards’ syndrome, you can choose to have a further
diagnostic test
if you wish.
No test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Edward’s syndrome or how they’ll be affected.
Risk of miscarriage and stillbirth
Around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Edwards’ syndrome from screening tests will end in
miscarriage
or
stillbirth
.
The risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth.
Effects of Edwards’ syndrome on babies
If your baby is affected by Edwards’ syndrome, it is likely they will have associated health conditions (other conditions often found in babies with Edwards’ syndrome). Some of these may be serious. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Edwards’ syndrome they have.
Babies with full form Edwards’ syndrome
Full form Edwards’ syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live.
Around 5 in 10 (52.5%) will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (12.3%) will live longer than 5 years.
Babies born with full form Edwards’ syndrome will have a learning disability which may be severe. They’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically:
around 9 in 10 (90%) will have heart issues
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity)
around 1 in 10 (10%) will have a cleft lip and/or palate
Babies with mosaic form and partial form Edwards’ syndrome
Currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards’ syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on:
how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic)
how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)
Some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Edwards’ syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.
Many babies with the mosaic form of Edwards’ syndrome will have some form of learning disability and developmental delay (when a child takes longer to start doing certain activities, like walking and talking, than other children their age).
The life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards’ syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.
Living with Edwards’ syndrome
Each child is unique, and Edwards’ syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they’ll have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.
Babies with full form Edwards’ syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered “medically fragile”. This means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. They may also:
have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube
have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)
Despite their complex needs, children with Edwards’ syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.
Many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school.
Feedback from many parents suggests that children with Edwards’ syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.
Congenital and rare condition register
Babies with Edwards’ syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.
The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.
It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.

About febrile seizures
A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever.
Febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren’t serious.
Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years.
During a febrile seizure, the child’s body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.
Read more about the
symptoms of febrile seizures
What to do during a seizure
If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the
recovery position
. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury.
Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.
If it’s your child’s first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the
nearest hospital
as soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. While it’s unlikely that there’s anything seriously wrong, it’s best to be sure.
If your child has had febrile seizures before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or the NHS 24 111 service for advice.
Don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth during a seizure because there’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue.
Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.
Read more about
diagnosing febrile seizures
and
treating febrile seizures
Types of febrile seizure
There are two main types of febrile seizure.
Simple febrile seizure
A simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. It’s a fit that:
is a tonic clonic seizure (see above)
lasts less than 15 minutes
doesn’t reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness
Complex febrile seizure
Complex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features:
the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes
your child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure)
your child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period of illness
your child doesn’t fully recover from the seizure within one hour
Why febrile seizures occur
The cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they’re linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above).
In most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as:
chickenpox
flu (influenza)
middle ear infections (otitis media)
tonsillitis
There may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition.
Read more about the
causes of febrile seizures
Complications
Febrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of
epilepsy
, as well as other problems.
Recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy.
However, this link hasn’t been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance.
In addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood.
Febrile seizures and epilepsy
Many parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they’ll develop
epilepsy
when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever.
While it’s true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small.
It’s estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life.
This is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven’t had febrile seizures.
Symptoms of febrile seizures
The main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.
Febrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.
However, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.
Simple febrile seizures
can happen when there’s a rapid rise in temperature and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit. Alternatively, they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level.
During simple febrile seizures:
your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch
they’ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves
they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back
the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes
following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards
Complex febrile seizures
tend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child’s body. The seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.
Seeking medical advice
You should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if:
your child is having a fit for the first time
the seizure lasts longer than five minutes and shows no signs of stopping
you suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for example
meningitis
your child is having breathing difficulties
If your child has previously had febrile seizures, it’s recommended that you telephone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice.
You should also contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service if your child shows
signs and symptoms of dehydration
(a lack of fluid in the body). This includes:
a
dry mouth
sunken eyes
a lack of tears when crying
a sunken fontanelle – the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child’s head
Causes of febrile seizures
Febrile seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown.
Some researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible.
A high temperature is thought to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that affect the parts of the brain and nervous system responsible for regulating the body’s temperature. Their release causes a rise in the body’s temperature.
One theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily ‘scramble’ the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure.
Family history
Although febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk.
If a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. The more relatives affected, the higher the risk.
This is probably the result of one or more genetic mutations that a child inherits from their parents, which makes them more susceptible to seizures. A genetic mutation means the instructions carried in certain genes become ‘scrambled’, resulting in some of the body’s processes not working in the normal way.
Associated infections
Most febrile seizures occur when a child has a high temperature caused by an infection. The three most common infections associated with febrile convulsions are:
viral infections, such as
chickenpox
and
flu
middle ear infections
(otitis media)
tonsillitis
Other infections associated with febrile seizures are:
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
upper respiratory tract infection – an infection of the mouth, nose and throat, and associated tissues and structures
gastroenteritis
– an infection of the digestive system
lower respiratory tract infections, such as
pneumonia
(a lung infection) and
bronchitis
(an infection of the airways that supply the lungs)
Vaccinations
In rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination. Research has shown that your child has a one in 3,000 to 4,000 chance of having a febrile seizure after having the
MMR vaccine
.
The risks are even lower with the
DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine
– a one in 11,000 to 16,000.
Diagnosing febrile seizures
Febrile seizures can often be diagnosed from a description of what happened.
Further tests may be needed if the cause of the associated infection isn’t clear.
It’s unlikely that your doctor will see the seizure, so an account of what happened is useful.
It’s useful to know:
how long the seizure lasted
what happened – body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring and loss of consciousness
whether your child recovered within one hour
whether they’ve had a seizure before
Tests to identify the source of the infection will only usually be necessary to rule out rarer conditions which can cause similar symptoms, such as
meningitis
.
A blood or urine sample may be needed to test for signs of infection. It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital.
Read more about
blood tests
Further tests
Further tests may be carried out in hospital if your child’s symptoms are unusual – for example, if they don’t have a high temperature or their seizures don’t follow the normal pattern.
Further testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child is having
complex febrile seizures
.
Your child may have other tests including an electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture, particularly if they’re less than 12 months old.
These two tests are explained below.
Electroencephalogram
An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures your child’s electrical brain activity through electrodes that are placed on their scalp. Unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicate
epilepsy
.
However, some studies have suggested that an EEG may not be useful in many cases of febrile seizures.
Lumbar puncture
During a
lumbar puncture
, a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed for testing. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.
A hollow needle is inserted into the base of the spine to obtain the CSF sample. During the procedure,
local anaesthetic
will be used to numb your child’s back so that they don’t feel any pain.
A lumbar puncture can be used to determine whether your child has an infection of the brain or nervous system.
Treating febrile seizures
In many cases, febrile seizures do not need to be treated, although care should be taken to deal with a seizure as it happens.
What to do during a seizure
If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the
recovery position
. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, and will keep their airway open and help prevent injury.
Stay with your child while they’re having a seizure, and make a note of when the seizure started to keep track of how long it lasts. If the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service.
If it’s your child’s first seizure, or if it lasts longer than five minutes, take your child to the
nearest hospital
as soon as possible.
While there’s probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it’s best to be sure.
Don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth while they’re having a seizure. There’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn’t usually serious and will heal within a few days.
Trying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for them.
High temperature (fever)
Reducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable.
Paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
have been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. However, they won’t reduce the chances of your child actually having a seizure.
Removing any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child’s temperature.
Aspirin should never be given to children under 16 years of age because there’s a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called Reye’s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage.
The use of cold sponges or fans isn’t recommended for treating a high temperature. There’s little evidence that they’re effective, and they may cause your child discomfort. Your GP will be able to give you additional advice about treating the underlying cause of your child’s high temperature.
It’s also important to prevent
dehydration
during a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.
Recurring febrile seizures
About one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. This often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure.
Recurrence is more likely if:
the first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old
there’s a history of seizures or
epilepsy
in your family
before having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one hour or their temperature was less than 40C (104F)
your child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode (
complex febrile seizure
)
your child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the
flu
or
chickenpox
)
It’s not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. This is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks of the seizures themselves.
Research has shown that the use of medication to control fever isn’t likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures.
However, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. For example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged.
In this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever.
Children who’ve had a febrile seizure following a routine
vaccination
(which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who’ve had a seizure due to another cause for fever."

About erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection.
Erectile dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree.
When to see your GP
See your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as
heart disease
(when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).
Find your local GP practice
Why does erectile dysfunction happen?
Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include:
narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with
high blood pressure
(hypertension),
high cholesterol
or
diabetes
hormonal problems
surgery or injury
Psychological causes of ED include:
anxiety
depression
relationship problems
Sometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.
If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical.
Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines.
Read more about the
causes of erectile dysfunction
Diagnosis
Although you may be embarrassed, it’s important to get a diagnosis so that the cause can be identified.
Your GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests.
Read more about
diagnosing erectile dysfunction
How is erectile dysfunction treated?
Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological.
The narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of
cardiovascular disease
. This may help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health.
You may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-lowering
statins
and drugs to reduce your blood pressure.
A number of treatments have been successful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Medication, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), can be used to manage it in at least two-thirds of cases. Vacuum pumps that encourage blood to flow to the penis and cause an erection are also successful in 90% of cases.
Psychological treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and sex therapy.
Overall, treatments for erectile dysfunction have improved significantly in recent years. Most men are eventually able to have sex again.

treating erectile dysfunction
Symptoms of erectile dysfunction
The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.
ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.
Inability to get an erection
Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.
In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.
Seek medical advice
See your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as
heart disease
(when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).
Many websites offer treatments for ED but their use is not recommended. The medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. Even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you.
It is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you.

treating erectile dysfunction
Causes of erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED) can have many causes, such as certain medical conditions, medications and stress.
It’s important to identify the cause of erectile dysfunction and treat any underlying conditions.
Erections
When a man becomes sexually excited (aroused), his brain sends signals to the nerves in his penis. The nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden.
Anything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to erectile dysfunction.
Anything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido) can also cause erectile dysfunction because a
reduced libido
makes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. Psychological conditions, such as
depression
, can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body).
Physical causes
There are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in erectile dysfunction. These are:
conditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis – vasculogenic
conditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord – neurogenic
conditions affecting your hormone levels – hormonal
conditions affecting the physical structure of your penis – anatomical
Injuries and surgery
Penis injuries or surgical treatment of the penis, pelvis or surrounding areas can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction.
Erectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who experience a
severe head injury
.
Vasculogenic conditions
Examples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include:
cardiovascular disease
– a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
diabetes
– a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. This can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic condition
Erectile dysfunction is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. For this reason, it may be one of the first causes your GP considers when making a diagnosis and planning your treatment.
Neurogenic conditions
Examples of neurogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include:
multiple sclerosis
– a condition that affects the body’s actions, such as movement and balance
Parkinson’s disease
– a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing
a spinal injury or disorder
a
stroke
– a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted
Hormonal conditions
Examples of hormonal conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include:
hypogonadism – a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels
an
overactive thyroid gland
(hyperthyroidism) – where too much thyroid hormone is produced
an
underactive thyroid gland
(hypothyroidism) – where not enough thyroid hormone is produced
Cushing’s syndrome
– a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisol
Anatomical conditions
Peyronie’s disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause erectile dysfunction.
Medicine
In some men, certain medicines can cause erectile dysfunction, including:
diuretics – these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease
antihypertensives – such as
beta-blockers
, that are used to treat high blood pressure
fibrates – medicines used to lower
cholesterol
levels
antipsychotics – used to treat some mental health conditions, such as
schizophrenia
antidepressants
–  used to treat depression and some types of pain
corticosteroids
– medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone
H2-antagonists – medicines used to treat
stomach ulcers
anticonvulsants – used to treat
epilepsy
antihistamines – used to treat allergic health conditions, such as
hay fever
anti-androgens – medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones)
cytotoxics – medication used in
chemotherapy
to prevent cancer cells from dividing and growing
Speak to your GP if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. Alternative medication may be available. However, it is important never to stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.
Psychological causes
Possible psychological causes of erectile dysfunction include:
depression
– feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time
anxiety – a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear
Erectile dysfunction can often have both physical and psychological causes. For example, if you have diabetes, it may be difficult for you to get an erection, which may cause you to become anxious about the situation. The combination of diabetes and anxiety may lead to an episode of erectile dysfunction.
There are many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. These include:
relationship problems
lack of sexual knowledge
past sexual problems
past sexual abuse
being in a new relationship
Other causes
Other possible causes of erectile dysfunction include:
excessive alcohol intake
tiredness
using illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocaine
Cycling
Men who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction.
Riding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction.
Diagnosing erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED) can often be diagnosed by your GP. They will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination.
Your GP may ask you about:
your symptoms
your overall physical and mental health
your alcohol consumption
whether you take drugs
whether you are currently taking any medication
If you do not want to talk to your GP about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can find your nearest GUM clinic on the
British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH)
website.
Sexual history
You’ll also be asked about your sexual history. Try not to be embarrassed because erectile dysfunction is a common problem. You can request a male GP at your surgery if you prefer.
You may be asked about:
your previous and current sexual relationships
what your sexual orientation is
how long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction
whether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning
whether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm
your libido (your level of sexual desire)
Erectile dysfunction that happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause.
Erectile dysfunction that only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause.
Assessing your cardiovascular health
Your GP may assess your cardiovascular health. Narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked with
cardiovascular disease
(conditions that affect the heart and blood flow).
Your GP may:
measure your blood pressure to see if you have
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
listen to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities
measure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height
ask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do
test a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vessels
Physical examinations and tests
A physical examination of your penis may be carried out to rule out anatomical causes (conditions that affect the physical structure of your penis).
If you have symptoms of an
enlarged prostate
, such as weak or irregular urination, a
digital rectal examination (DRE)
may be suggested.
Blood tests
can also check for underlying health conditions. For example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone).
Further testing
In some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. This might be the case if you are unusually young to be experiencing erectile dysfunction as it’s rare in men under 40 years of age.
Intracavernous injection test
An intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. This helps assess any abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery.
If the injection doesn’t result in an erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. In some cases, you may also need an
ultrasound scan
.
Arteriography and dynamic infusion cavernosometry or cavernosography
These specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. These are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels.
Psychological assessment
If the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered for a psychological assessment.
Treating erectile dysfunction
If you have erectile dysfunction (ED), treatment will depend on what’s causing it. The various treatments for erectile dysfunction are outlined below.
Treating underlying conditions
If your erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such as
heart disease
or
diabetes
, that condition may need to be treated first. In some cases, treating the underlying cause may also resolve the problem.
If you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. It is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.
Lifestyle changes
Erectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:
losing weight
if you are overweight
giving up smoking
cutting back your
alcohol
consumption
not taking illegal drugs
exercising regularly
reducing
stress
As well as helping to improve your erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels).

preventing cardiovascular disease
Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors
Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are one of the most widely used and effective types of medication for treating erectile dysfunction. They work by temporarily increasing the blood flow to your penis.
In England, four PDE-5 inhibitors are available for treating erectile dysfunction. They are:
sildenafil – sold under the brand name Viagra
tadalafil – sold under the brand name Cialis
vardenafil – sold under the brand name Levitra
avanafil – sold under the brand name Spedra
Sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil work for about eight hours and they are designed to work ‘on demand’. Tadalafil lasts for up to 36 hours and is more suitable if you require treatment for a longer period of time, for example, over a weekend.
Depending on the type of PDE-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. With sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. After taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours.
It may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it’s best to take it on an empty stomach. You can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine.
Only take one tablet within a 24-hour period.
Your GP should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. The choice may depend on:
how often you are sexually active
whether you have tried any of the medications before
There have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. In general, at least two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines.
If you do not find that PDE-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because:
you have not waited long enough after taking the dose
you have waited too long after taking the dose
the dose is not high enough
you have not had enough sexual stimulation
These medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work.
Warnings
PDE-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in men who have
cardiovascular disease
, such as coronary heart disease. However, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. You should discuss the risks and benefits with your GP.
PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as Peyronie’s disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis).
PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who:
are at risk of priapism – a painful erection that lasts for several hours
are also taking long lasting alpha-blockers – a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such as
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
Do not take PDE-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. The combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart.
Organic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as ‘poppers’.
You are also warned not to take PDE-5 inhibitors if you:
have been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels
have
low blood pressure
(hypotension)
have recently had a
stroke
– a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted
have unstable
angina
– an underlying heart condition that causes symptoms such as chest pain
have had a
heart attack
– a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked
have a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy – an eye condition that causes a sudden loss of vision
Side effects
PDE-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including:
headaches and migraines
flushing (redness)
indigestion
nausea (feeling sick)
vomiting (being sick)
a blocked or runny nose
back pain
vision disturbances
muscle pain
Vacuum pumps
A vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated.
You place your penis in the tube and pump out all of the air. This creates a vacuum that causes the blood to fill your penis, making it erect. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis to keep the blood in place, allowing you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.
It may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. After using a vacuum pump, nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ED.
Considerations
You should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking
anticoagulant medicines
, which reduce the ability of your blood to clot.
Side effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men.
Men who qualify for NHS prescriptions for erectile dysfunction treatments may be able to get a vacuum pump on the NHS (see above for more details). However, some men will need to buy one.
The
Sexual Advice Association
produces a number of factsheets, including one on vacuum pumps that provides details of companies that supply them.
Alprostadil
If your erectile dysfunction doesn’t respond to treatment, or you are unable or unwilling to use PDE-5 inhibitors or a vacuum pump, you may be given a medicine called alprostadil. This is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis.
Alprostadil is available as:
an injection directly into your penis – this is called an intracavernosal injection
a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis) – this is called urethral application
You may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. If your partner is pregnant, use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra.
Alprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. How long the erection lasts will depend on the dose.
In men who did not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. Alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men.
Warnings
Alprostadil should not be used:
in men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours) – for example, those with sickle cell anaemia
alongside other erectile dysfunction medications
if you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activity
Urethral application may also not be used in:
some men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis)
men who have infections of their penis, such as balantis (inflammation of the head of the penis)
Side effects
Alprostadil can cause some side effects including:
changes in your blood pressure
dizziness
headache
pain in your penis
urethral burning or bleeding
reactions at the site of the injection, such as swelling
NHS prescriptions
As with PDE-5 inhibitors, NHS prescriptions for alprostadil may only be available for men with particular health conditions or those receiving some types of medical treatments. If you need to pay the full prescription cost, a single injection of alprostadil costs around £8 to £22, depending on the dose. A single dose of alprostadil for urethral application is around £10.
Hormone therapy
If a hormonal condition is causing erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal conditions).
Hormones are chemicals produced by the body. Many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels.
Surgery
Surgery for erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. It may also be considered in:
younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area – for example, in a car accident
men with a significant anatomical problem with their penis
In the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. The surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. However, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it’s unlikely to be used.
Penile implants
Penile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. These can be:
semi-rigid implants – which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly
inflatable implants – which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erection
Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants may be very expensive. However, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery.
Complications
As with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted carries a risk of infection. If you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around two or three in 100. Mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in five per cent of cases.
Psychological treatments
If your erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus.
If conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from counselling (a talking therapy).
Sensate focus
Sensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. It starts with you both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. During this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman’s breasts). The idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex.
After the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other’s genital areas. You can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. This can build up to include penetrative sex.
You can find out more about sensate focus from the
College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT)
.
Psychosexual counselling
Psychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction. By talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your erectile dysfunction.
The counsellor can also provide you with some practical advice about sex, such as how to make effective use of other treatments for erectile dysfunction to improve your sex life.
Psychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have erectile dysfunction. CBT is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. CBT helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. It is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it.
Your CBT therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction – for example, to do with:
your self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself)
your sexuality
your personal relationships
Your CBT therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues.
Pelvic floor muscle exercises
Some studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. These are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis.
Pelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. If your GP feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly.
By strengthening and training these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of erectile dysfunction.
Complementary therapies
Some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. However, there is little evidence they are useful.
In some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects.
Always speak to your GP before using any complementary therapies."

Your normal body temperature is approximately 37°C. A fever is usually when your body temperature is 37.8°C or higher. You may feel warm, cold or shivery.
You can find out if you have a fever by using a thermometer to take your temperature.
Fever in adults self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
What causes a fever?
A fever is your body’s natural response to many common illnesses such as:
flu
tonsillitis
kidney or urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Fever helps your body fight infections by stimulating your immune system (your body’s natural defence). By increasing your body’s temperature, a fever makes it harder for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive.
When to get help
Contact your GP practice immediately if:
You have a fever and you:
are on treatment for immune deficiency
are on immune-suppressant drugs, such as regular steroids, methotrexate, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide
are taking medication where you have been warned about a risk of a reduced immune system
are
on, or recently completed, treatment for cancer, leukaemia or lymphoma
are
a transplant recipient
are
HIV positive
have chronic lung disease
have asthma which has been treated with medication in the last 3 years
have heart disease (excluding blood pressure which is currently well controlled)
have diabetes or another metabolic disease
have chronic gastrointestinal or liver disease
have chronic renal (kidney) disease
have cystic fibrosis
have neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy
have sickle cell disease
Contact your GP practice if:
you have severe thirst or are peeing less
you are passing urine that is darker than normal
you are light-headed or weak
you have new, severe muscle cramps
your symptoms have worsened or you notice new symptoms
you’ve had a fever after recent foreign travel
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
Treating a fever
Most fevers will improve on their own in a few days. However, there are a number of things you can do to help the uncomfortable feelings associated with a fever.
Do
wear loose comfortable clothing
make sure the room you are in isn’t too warm
drink more fluids (for example water) so you don’t get dehydrated – you should be peeing approximately every 6 hours (a pale yellow urine means you’re unlikely to be dehydrated)
avoid alcohol as this can make dehydration worse
take a medicine that reduces fever such as paracetamol (unless you’re allergic or have been told by a healthcare professional that you can’t take it)
Don’t
do not over dress
do not attempt to make yourself feel cold
Fever in children
Fever affects people of all ages, however it often affects babies and younger children in response to minor illnesses such as:
coughs
colds

Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness. You can catch flu all year round, but it’s especially common in winter. This is why it’s also known as seasonal flu.
You can catch flu many times because flu viruses change regularly. Your body won’t have a natural resistance to the new versions.
Flu symptoms
Some of the main symptoms of flu include:
a sudden high temperature
tiredness and weakness
a headache
general aches and pains
a dry, chesty cough
sore throat
difficulty sleeping
loss of appetite
diarrhoea or tummy pain
feeling sick and being sick
chills
a runny or blocked nose
sneezing
The symptoms are similar for children. They may also get pain in their ear and be less active.
How long do symptoms last
The symptoms of flu usually develop 1 to 3 days after becoming infected. Most people will feel better within a week.
But, you may have a lingering cough and still feel very tired for a few more weeks.
Flu-like illness self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if you:
get sudden chest pain
have difficulty breathing
start coughing up a lot of blood
Phone 111 or ask for an urgent GP appointment if:
You or your child have symptoms of flu and:
you’re worried about your baby’s or child’s symptoms
you’re 65 or over
you’re pregnant
you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes or a condition that affects your heart, lungs, kidneys, brain or nerves
you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or HIV
your symptoms don’t improve after 7 days
Get advice from a pharmacist
A pharmacist can give you advice about how to treat flu.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Treating flu at home
If you have flu, there are things you can do to help you recover more quickly.
Do
rest
get plenty of sleep
keep warm
drink lots of water to avoid dehydration
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
stay off work or school until you feel better
Don’t
do not take paracetamol and flu remedies that contain paracetamol at the same time
GPs don’t recommend antibiotics for flu. They won’t relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
Preventing the spread of flu
Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes. These can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures.
Do
wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water
clean surfaces like your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles regularly
use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as soon as possible
avoid unnecessary contact with other people while you’re infectious
stay off work or school until you’re feeling better
How to wash your hands properly
Help to keep germs at bay by washing your hands properly.
The difference between flu and a cold
It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have flu or
a cold.
Flu symptoms:
come on quickly
usually include fever and aching muscles
are more severe
Cold symptoms:
come on gradually
mainly affect your nose and throat
are fairly mild, so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work
Flu vaccine
The annual flu vaccine can help reduce your risk of getting flu each year.
It’s offered every year for free by the NHS to help protect people at risk of flu and its complications.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/fibromyalgia/,"Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body.
Symptoms of fibromyalgia
The main symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain that might feel like:
an ache
a burning sensation
a sharp stabbing pain
a mixture of these 3 feelings
The pain is likely to be continuous, but it might be better or more severe at different times.
As well as widespread pain, people with fibromyalgia might also have:
increased sensitivity to sensations like touch, light, temperature, noise
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
muscle stiffness
difficulty sleeping
problems with mental processes (known as “fibro-fog”) – like problems with memory and concentration
headaches
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
– a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating
dizziness and clumsiness
feeling too hot or too cold
restless legs syndrome
tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations in your hands and feet (pins and needles, also known as paraesthesia)
unusually painful periods (if you get periods)
anxiety
depression
Speak to your GP or healthcare professional if:
you think you might have fibromyalgia
Causes of fibromyalgia
It’s not clear why some people develop fibromyalgia. The exact cause is unknown, but it’s likely that many factors are involved.
Altered pain messages
Your brain, nerves and spinal cord make up your central nervous system. Changes in the way your central nervous system sends and receives information to your body might cause fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia is a type of chronic pain.
Read more about chronic pain
Genetics
Some people are more likely than others to develop fibromyalgia because of the genes inherited (passed on) from their parents.
Triggers
Fibromyalgia is often triggered by a stressful event. This might be a physically stressful event or an emotionally (psychologically) stressful event.
Possible triggers of fibromyalgia might be:
an injury
a viral infection
giving birth
an operation
the breakdown of a relationship
being in an abusive relationship
the death of a loved one
Sometimes there isn’t an obvious trigger.
Diagnosing fibromyalgia
Diagnosing fibromyalgia can be difficult. There’s no specific test to diagnose the condition.
The symptoms of fibromyalgia can vary. The symptoms can be similar to those of several other conditions. Your GP will have to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.
You’ll be asked about how your symptoms are affecting your daily life. You’ll be examined to check for signs of other conditions. They’ll check for swollen joints which might suggest arthritis, rather than fibromyalgia.
Tests to check for some of these conditions include urine and
blood tests
. You may also have
X-rays
and other scans. If you’re found to have another condition, you could still have fibromyalgia as well.
Criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia
For fibromyalgia to be diagnosed, certain criteria usually have to be met. The most widely used criteria for diagnosis are:
you have pain in multiple areas of your body
your symptoms have stayed at a similar level for at least 3months
your symptoms can’t be explained by any other reason
you feel unrefreshed after sleep
you have problems thinking or remembering (cognitive difficulties)
you experience fatigue
Diagnosing other conditions
It’s also possible to have other conditions alongside fibromyalgia, like:
depression
anxiety
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
osteoarthritis
hypermobility spectrum disorder
Identifying all possible conditions will help to guide your treatment.
Treating fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a long term (chronic) condition.
There’s no cure for fibromyalgia. But there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms. This can make the condition easier to live with.
Traditional treatments like pain medication aren’t always helpful for people with fibromyalgia. Learning about your condition and finding the best self management approaches for you is the best way to manage it.
A healthcare professional can help you explore your options.
Exercise, movement and activity
Exercise, movement and activity can be helpful way to manage pain.
A physiotherapist can help you to develop self-management skills to reduce the impact of pain on your life. They might help you create a tailored exercise programme suited to your needs, abilities and goals.
Physiotherapy can also help prevent further loss of strength and increase your fitness.
Pain management movement videos
Visit the
living with chronic pain page
for more information about exercise and relaxation techniques.
Occupational therapy can help you manage your everyday activities around fibromyalgia. The aim is to do this without increasing your pain or overwhelming yourself.
Your occupational therapist may suggest new ways to do things. They may be able to support you to continue to work, if you want to.
Access to Work
has information on how to get or stay in work if you have a health condition or disability.
Group support
Some pain clinics offer pain management programmes run by a team of specialists. These specialists can include physiotherapists and psychologists. They can provide support to develop coping skills and manage your activity levels.
Speak to your GP if you think you’d benefit from a pain management programme.
Talking therapies
Talking therapies can help you manage the stress of living with fibromyalgia.
Examples of talking therapies are:
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a treatment approach to help you understand the link between how we think and what we do
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) – often used for pain management
Medication
Medication can’t treat fibromyalgia but it can help reduce some symptoms. Speak to your GP or pain specialist to find out the potential benefits and risks.
Your GP will likely suggest you try exercise, CBT and physiotherapy first. This is because these treatments are more likely to help.
Antidepressants
can help some people with fibromyalgia. They help:
relieve pain
treat sleep problems
This can be useful even if you haven’t been diagnosed with depression.
Other medications can be used for the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms, but they’re likely to be less effective.
Speak to your GP, pharmacist or healthcare professional if you’re taking medication and you don’t feel its helping.
Alternative therapies
Some people with fibromyalgia try complementary or alternative treatments, like acupuncture or massage.
There’s little scientific evidence that these treatments help in the long term. Some people find that certain treatments help them to relax and feel less stressed. This allows them to cope with their condition better.
If you decide to use complementary or herbal remedies, check with your GP or healthcare professional first. Some remedies can react unpredictably with other medication, or make it less effective.

It can be extremely worrying if your child has a high temperature. But it’s very common and often clears up by itself without treatment.
A quick and easy way to find out whether your child has a fever is to take their temperature using a thermometer.
What causes a high temperature?
Most fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses. The high body temperature makes it more difficult for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive.
Common conditions that can cause fevers include:
upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs)
flu
ear infections
roseola – a virus that causes a temperature and a rash
tonsillitis
kidney or
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
common childhood illnesses, such as
chickenpox
and
whooping cough
Your child’s temperature can also be raised after vaccinations, or if they overheat because of too much bedding or clothing.
When to seek medical help
Phone 999 if your child:
has a stiff neck
has a rash that does not fade when you press a glass against it (
use the ‘glass test’ from Meningitis Now
)
is bothered by light
has a fit (
febrile seizure
) for the first time (they cannot stop shaking)
has unusually cold hands and feet
has blue, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue
has a weak, high-pitched cry that’s not like their normal cry
is drowsy and hard to wake
is extremely agitated (does not stop crying) or is confused
finds it hard to breathe and sucks their stomach in under their ribs
is not responding like they normally do, or is not interested in feeding or normal activities
Contact your GP if:
Your child:
is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38°C (101°F) or above
is over 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C (102°F) or above
has other signs of illness, such as a
rash
, as well as a high temperature
has a high temperature that’s lasted for 5 days or more
has persistent vomiting
does not want to eat, or is not their usual self and you’re worried
has a high temperature that does not come down with paracetamol
is dehydrated – such as nappies that are not very wet, sunken eyes, and no tears when they’re crying
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
If your child seems to be otherwise well – for example, if they’re playing and attentive – it’s less likely they’re seriously ill.
Fever in babies and children under 2 years of age self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your child’s symptoms and find out what to do next.
Treating a fever
If your child has a fever, it’s important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink.
Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula. Even if your child isn’t thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up.
If it’s warm, you could help your child to stay at a comfortable temperature by covering them with a lightweight sheet or opening a window.
However, they should still be appropriately dressed for their surroundings and sponging your child with cool water isn’t recommended to reduce a fever.
Medicine to reduce fever (antipyretics)
Children’s
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
work as antipyretics, which help to reduce fever, as well as being painkillers. You can’t give them both at the same time, but if one doesn’t work, you may want to try the other later.
Antipyretics aren’t always needed. If your child isn’t distressed by the fever or underlying illness, there’s no need to use antipyretics to reduce a fever.
Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication. This will tell you the correct dose and frequency for your child’s age.
More serious illnesses
Sometimes a high temperature in children is associated with more serious signs and symptoms, such as:
breathlessness
vomiting
rash
fits or seizures
Possible serious bacterial illnesses include:
meningitis
– infection of the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord
septicaemia
– infection of the blood
pneumonia
– inflammation of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection
Potentially serious causes of fever are relatively rare."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/food-poisoning/,"Food poisoning
Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It’s not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.
In most cases, food is contaminated by bacteria or a virus like:
campylobacter – the most common cause of food poisoning
salmonella
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
norovirus
listeria
Food Standards Scotland
has further information about bacteria and viruses that can cause food poisoning.
Symptoms of food poisoning
Symptoms of food poisoning include:
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus
stomach cramps and abdominal pain
a lack of energy and weakness
loss of appetite
a high temperature of 38C or above (fever)
aching muscles
chills
The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within 1 to 2 days of eating contaminated food. They can also start a few hours later or several weeks later.
What to do if you have food poisoning
Do
stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least 2 days
rest
drink lots of water to prevent dehydration – you can sip it if this is easier
consider speaking to your pharmacist about an oral rehydration solution (ORS)
eat when you feel up to it – try small, light meals
eat bland foods like toast, crackers, banana and rice until you feel better
avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks, spice and fatty foods – they may make you feel worse
Speak to a GP if you:
have a weak immune system – for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV
have severe symptoms
are pregnant
don’t start to see improvements to your symptoms after a few days
are unable to keep down any fluids because you’re vomiting repeatedly
have symptoms of severe dehydration, like confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine
are over 60
think your baby or young child has food poisoning
have a long-term underlying condition, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes or kidney disease
How you get food poisoning
Food poisoning is caused by eating something that’s been contaminated with germs. Any type of food can cause food poisoning.
Food can be contaminated if it’s
not cooked or reheated thoroughly
not stored correctly – for example, it’s not been frozen or chilled
left out for too long
handled by someone who’s ill or hasn’t washed their hands
eaten after its ‘use by’ date
not reheating cooked food well enough
Further information on preparing and cooking food safely
Preventing infection when you’re ill
Do
try to keep contact with vulnerable people to a minimum, for example the very young or elderly
wash your hands with soap and warm water often
clean surfaces, toilet seats, flush handles, basins and taps often
make sure everyone in the household has their own towels and flannels
wash the laundry of the infected person on the hottest washing machine setting"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/feeling-of-something-in-your-throat-globus/,"Feeling of something in your throat (Globus)
Globus is a symptom that can make you feel like you have a lump in your throat. It is also called ‘globus sensation’.
Globus can be caused by many things, such as an increased tension of muscles or irritation in the throat.
There are various things you can do to manage your globus symptoms at home, without the need to attend your GP.
Signs and symptoms of globus
Different people describe it differently. It may be felt as:
tightness or a pressure in your throat
catarrh/mucus that you are unable to clear
an area of discomfort in your throat
a feeling of something stuck or a lump in your throat
If you feel something sticking in your throat, but can eat and drink normally and without pain, you do not need to worry.
Many people with globus sensation notice the symptoms most when they are swallowing their saliva, or that it increases with stress and worry. Your symptoms can vary from day to day.
Treating globus at home
There are a number of things you can do to try to relieve globus symptoms.
Eating and drinking
Try to drink at least 1.5 litres (3 pints) of water every day. You should drink in small sips as swallowing helps to relax the throat.
Avoid too much alcohol, tea, coffee and fizzy drinks. They can cause the throat to be dry.
Try to reduce the amount of fatty and spicy food in your diet.
Leave at least 3 hours between your last meal and going to bed. Avoid snacking between your last meal and bedtime.
Consider
trying anti-reflux medication (your pharmacist can advise).
Smoking
Smoking causes irritation to your throat. By stopping smoking, you can help to improve your globus symptoms.
Your pharmacist or GP can offer support if you would like advice.
Further information on stopping smoking
Throat clearing
Try not to clear your throat as this can make your globus sensation worse. You can try sipping water, instead.
Losing weight
Losing any excess weight
may reduce your symptoms
.
Reducing stress
Stress can increase your globus sensation.
If you think you might be stressed, try to relax in a way that is doable for you and your situation.
Breathing and relaxation exercises
can sometimes help, but if you feel you need further help with managing stress, your GP can discuss this with you.
Further information about relieving stress
In most people, symptoms will get better following these self-help tips. However, for some people symptoms can recur off and on for several months.
When to see your GP
There are no specific tests to diagnose globus. Further investigations are not required, so you don’t usually need to see a GP.
Speak to your GP if:
you develop any difficulty or pain when swallowing
you feel a lump in the neck
you experience unintentional weight loss
your symptoms do not improve
If your symptoms do not improve, your GP will provide further support and advice on whether you need to see an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/farting/,"Farting
Farting (flatulence) is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It’s a normal process and something everyone experiences regularly.
There are things you can do if you fart a lot or your farts are smelly.
Causes of farting
When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air. This collects in the digestive system. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting or burping. Gases can also build up when you digest food.
Causes of excessive farting
Excessive farting can be caused by:
swallowing more air than usual
eating foods that are difficult to digest
conditions affecting the digestive system like
indigestion
or
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
some medicines like
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
,
statins
and some
laxatives
Do not stop or change your medication without speaking to your GP first. It’s important that you don’t self-diagnose.
Speak to a GP if:
farting is affecting your life and self help and pharmacy treatments haven’t worked
you have a stomach ache or bloating that’ll not go away or comes back
you keep getting constipation or diarrhoea
you have lost weight without trying
you’ve had blood in your poo for 3 weeks
you have signs of an infection like a high temperature, vomiting, chills, joint pain and muscle pain
you’re unable to control your bowel movements (involuntary pooing)
Get advice from a pharmacist
A pharmacist can give you advice about excessive or smelly farts. They may be able to recommend something to help like:
charcoal tablets
special underwear or pads that absorb smells
A pharmacist may also be able to tell you if you need to speak to your GP.
Find your nearest pharmacy
How reduce excessive or smelly farting
Do
chew food slowly with your mouth closed
eat smaller meals, more often
drink slowly
exercise regularly to improve digestion
eat foods that are easy to digest like rice, bananas, citrus fruits and potatoes
drink peppermint tea
Don’t
do not chew gum, smoke or suck on pen tops or hard sweets to avoid swallowing excess air
do not wear loose-fitting dentures
do not drink lots of fizzy drinks and hot drinks
do not drink too much beer, wine or fruit juice
do not eat lots of foods that are difficult to digest and cause farting like beans, cabbage and lentils
do not eat lots of foods containing sorbitol (a sweetener) and fructose (a sugar) as these can cause farting"

About ganglion cysts
About ganglion cysts
Ganglion cysts are soft, gel-like masses that often change size.
They tend to be smooth and round, and are:
the most common type of swelling in the hand, wrist and foot
harmless and can safely be left alone
If you have a ganglion, try to stay positive. There’s a lot you can do to help yourself.
What causes ganglion cysts?
A ganglion cyst starts when the fluid leaks out of a joint or tendon tunnel and forms a swelling beneath the skin.
The cause of the leak is generally unknown, but may be due to trauma or underlying arthritis.
How common are they?
Ganglion cysts are 3 times more common in women than men between 20 and 40 years of age.
Types of ganglion cysts
Ganglions can form:
at the back of the wrist – these typically occur in young adults and often disappears without treatment
at the front of the wrist – these may occur in young adults, but also seen in older people with arthritis
at the base of the finger (flexor tendon sheath) – these usually occur in young adults
on the finger (mucoid cyst) – these usually occur in middle-aged or older people
Approximately 80% of ganglions are found in the wrist.
Ganglion cyst symptoms
If you have a ganglion cyst the swelling can become noticeable, but often there are no symptoms at all.
Sometimes a ganglion can cause pain and limit movement in your joint. Some people are also concerned about the cysts appearance.
Most symptoms settle with time.
How they’re diagnosed
To diagnose a ganglion cyst, a healthcare professional will ask you about it and examine your wrist and hand.
Giving a diagnosis is usually straightforward. However, scans may be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain.
Treating a ganglion cyst
About 50% of ganglions disappear on their own without treatment. In the early stages you should wait to see if this happens.
You won’t need treatment unless the cyst is painful.
Medication
Many people take medication to cope with their pain and symptoms, and help them remain active.
You may be prescribed pain medication to ease the pain. Make sure you take any medication as prescribed, and get advice from a GP, pharmacist or suitably trained healthcare professional.
Surgery
If the ganglion hasn’t reduced in size after 6 months or is causing significant functional difficulty and/or pain, you may be referred for further help and possible surgery.
Surgery is considered if it causes significant pain or restricts movement in your joint. However, there’s a chance it will come back even after surgery.
Ganglion cyst at the back of the wrist
Draining this ganglion can reduce the swelling but it often returns.
Problems after surgery include:
persistent pain
loss of wrist movement
painful trapping of nerve branches in the scar
There’s a 10% chance of it coming back again after surgery.
Ganglion cyst at the front of the wrist
Draining this ganglion may be useful, but it can be dangerous as the cyst is often close to the artery at the wrist (where you can feel the pulse).
Problems after surgery include:
persistent pain
loss of wrist movement
trapping of nerve branches in the scar
For these reasons, many surgeons advise against operating on these cysts.
There’s a 30 to 40% chance of it coming back again after surgery.
Ganglion cyst at the base of the finger
These ganglions feel like a dried pea at the base of the finger, and can cause pain when gripping.
Problems after surgery include:
persistent pain
loss of finger movement
painful trapping of nerve branches in the scar
There’s a small chance of it coming back again after surgery.
Finger ganglion cyst
These ganglions are associated with wearing out of the end joint of a finger. Pressure from the cyst may cause a furrow in the fingernail. Occasionally the cyst fluid leaks through the thin overlying skin.
Problems after surgery include:
infection
stiffness and pain from the worn out joint
There’s a 10% chance of it coming back again after surgery.
Work
If you have a ganglion cyst try to stay at or get back to work as soon as possible. You don’t need to be fully pain and symptom free to return to work.
Research shows the longer you’re off work the less likely you are to return."

Gallbladder cancer is very rare.
There are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer, depending on the cells affected.
Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the cancer started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder.
Cancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the different
types of gallbladder cancer
.
Cancer of the gallbladder is more common in women than men, with around 7 out of 10 cases diagnosed in women. It’s also more common in older people, particularly those over 70 years of age.
The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that’s located underneath the liver. It’s main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.
Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it’s stored.
Over time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.
The gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.
Symptoms of gallbladder cancer
In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, which means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it’s diagnosed.
Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include:
abdominal (stomach) pain
feeling sick
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
These symptoms could be linked to a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However, if you have these symptoms, you should speak to your GP so they can investigate what’s causing them.
Other possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss and a swollen stomach.
What causes gallbladder cancer?
In gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It’s not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.
Gallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age.
Lifestyle factors – such as
obesity
, smoking and an unhealthy diet – are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there’s not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.
There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example,
gallstones
, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and
diabetes
have been closely linked to the condition.
If you have a family history of gallstones, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer, you’re more likely to develop these conditions yourself.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the
risks and causes of gallbladder cancer
.
Diagnosing gallbladder cancer
Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system).
The specialist will ask about your medical history and check to see whether the lymph glands in your neck and groin are swollen.
You may also have some initial tests, including:
blood tests
an
ultrasound scan
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
If these tests reveal anything abnormal in or around your gallbladder, further tests may be arranged to help confirm whether you have gallbladder cancer. These may include:
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
biopsy
and fine needle aspiration (FNA)
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about
tests for gallbladder cancer
.
Treating gallbladder cancer
The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.
Chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery.
The treatment programme that’s most suitable for you will depend on:
the type of gallbladder cancer you have
the stage of your cancer
your overall level of health
As with all cancers, the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.

Not all symptoms that you may experience around your genitals are caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Symptoms can be caused by a variety of natural changes in your body as well as infections that are not sexually transmitted.
Phone 111 if you:
Become very ill and have:
severe pain
a high temperature
nausea and/or vomiting
Symptoms to discuss with sexual health services
Ulcers on the genitals
Single ulcers (sores) could be a sign of a recent infection of
syphilis
, especially if there is no pain.
Painful ulcers may be due to herpes, other infections or recent trauma. It can help to take a photo of your ulcer so you can show the sexual health clinician at your appointment.
If you think you have
mpox (monkeypox)
or you’ve come into contact in the last 21 days with someone who has mpox, you should phone your local service before you attend in person.
Pelvic pain
There are many causes of pain in the lower tummy. For example issues of the bowel or urinary tract and many gynaecological conditions.
Some STIs such as
gonorrhoea
, or
chlamydia
, can very occasionally spread up into the womb and cause pelvic pain and/or deep pain during sex.
If you have pain like this and think you have been at risk of an STI then you should
contact your local service
.
If there is any possibility that you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test.
Discharge from the end of the penis
Whether you have discomfort peeing or not, discharge from the end of the penis could mean that you have an STI such as
chlamydia
or
gonorrhoea
.
Book a consultation online
or contact your local
sexual health service
for advice.
Pain, swelling or inflammation around the testicles
Gonorrhoea
and
chlamydia
usually affect just the urinary tract. But sometimes infection can spread to the testicle and/or the epididymis (the small tube part next to the testicle).
This will cause painful swelling for which you should get treatment urgently.
Book a consultation online
or phone for advice​​.
Multiple painful genital ulcers
Having multiple genital ulcers could indicate
genital herpes
which is the same virus that causes cold sores.
Herpes is an extremely common virus. It sometimes causes symptoms which are mostly self-limiting. This means your immune system will deal with this itself, but it can take a few days for symptoms to settle.
Sometimes the ulcers are itchy before they become sore. There may be pain when peeing because this stings the ulcers.
Milder cases can be diagnosed and treated by your GP. If you’re worried about your symptoms, you could also contact your local
sexual health service
for advice.
Further information about herpes simplex viruses
Symptoms that aren’t usually a sign of anything serious
Spots or lumps on the genitals
Sometimes hair follicles (the tiny pockets from where each hair grows) around the genitals or groin area can become inflamed. This is called folliculitis. It may be more common if you shave the area. At first it may look like a small pimple. It may be itchy, and sore but in most cases it will resolve on it’s own. If you have any concerns contact your local
sexual health service
.
Another common cause of new spots or lumps on your genitals is warts.
Another possible cause is molluscum. Sometimes, teenagers notice lumps that are completely normal.
If you think that the lumps you have noticed are likely to be
genital warts
they might clear up on their own. One third of warts disappear within 6 months.
Your GP practice may be able to prescribe treatment for you or refer you to a sexual health clinic if treatment doesn’t work. Sexual health services available may vary across Scotland.
Itching
Genital skin can be sensitive. Itching is often a sign that you’re doing something, or using a product, that’s irritating the skin. If itching is your only symptom, it isn’t often related to an STI.
Itching around or inside the vagina is often due to
thrush
. You can get treatment over the counter at your
local pharmacy
.
Change in vaginal bleeding pattern
If you’ve changed your method of
contraception
, then you might notice a change in your bleeding pattern. This should settle but if you have any concerns, talk to your contraception provider.
Chlamydia
can sometimes cause bleeding after sex or between periods. If you have had unprotected sex with a new sexual partner and notice this type of bleeding, then
get tested for STIs
.
Change in vaginal discharge

Genital washing advice
Do
use a soap substitute (emollient) to add moisture instead of soap – these are available from pharmacies
use non-soap bath additives such as unfragranced bath oil instead of bubble bath
treat athlete’s foot straight away to prevent it spreading to your genital area when you pull your underwear on
if you have a penis with a foreskin, always remember to pull back the foreskin gently but fully when washing and dry gently with a towel before replacing the foreskin
Don’t
do not use soap on or near your genital area, it can be drying
do not let products like shampoo or conditioner run onto your genital skin
do not use bubble baths, essential oils or soap or shower gels in the bath as they’ll get onto the genital skin and may cause irritation
do not use wet wipes on the genital skin
do not use feminine washing products – even if they say they are pH balanced as they disrupt healthy bacteria in the vagina
do not ‘douche’ (wash out the vagina with water or other products) as it damages the healthy vaginal organisms and changes their natural balance
do not use fabric softeners"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/fungal-nail-infection/,"Fungal nail infection
Many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. It’s not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat.
The infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted.
Toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails.
The medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis.
A fungal nail infection can cause the nail to become thick, yellow and brittle.
https://dermnetnz.org/
Signs and symptoms of a fungal nail infection
A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.
As it progresses, the infection can cause:
discolouration of the nail – it may turn white, black, yellow or green
thickening and distortion of the nail – it may become an unusual shape or texture and be difficult to trim
pain or discomfort – particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger
brittle or crumbly nails – pieces may break off and come away completely
Sometimes the skin nearby may also become:
infected
itchy
cracked
red
swollen
What causes a fungal nail infection
Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete’s foot infecting the nails.
These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet.
You’re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you:
don’t keep your feet clean and dry
wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty
walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, like communal showers, locker rooms and gyms
have damaged your nails
have a weakened immune system
have certain other health conditions, like
diabetes
,
psoriasis
or peripheral arterial disease
Fungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this if you have an infection.
Speak to your GP or pharmacist if:
you’re bothered by the appearance of a nail with a fungal nail infection
the fungal nail infection is causing problems like pain or discomfort
Treating a fungal nail infection
A fungal nail infection is unlikely to get better without treatment. However, if you’re not bothered by it you might decide it’s not worth treating because treatment:
can take a long time
can cause side effects
isn’t always effective
Treatment may also be unnecessary in mild cases of fungal nail infection. It’s also unlikely to cause any further problems so you may feel it’s not worth treating.
For more severe or troublesome fungal nail infections, antifungal medication may be recommended.
Antifungal medication
Antifungal medication comes in tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail.
A small sample of the infected nail may need to be taken and sent off for testing before treatment starts, to confirm that you do have a fungal infection.
If the treatment is working, you should see a new healthy nail start to grow from the base of nail over the course of a few months. The old infected nail should begin to grow out and can be gradually clipped away.
Antifungal treatments are thought to be effective in treating about 60 to 80% of fungal nail infections. It can take between 6 and 18 months for the appearance of the affected nail to return to normal, and in some cases the nail may not look the same as before the infection.
Antifungal tablets
Terbinafine and itraconazole are the 2 medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections.
These usually need to be taken once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. If you stop taking the medication too early, the infection may return.
Possible side effects of antifungal tablets can include:
headache
itching
diarrhoea
loss of sense of taste
a rash
Antifungal tablets are currently not licensed to be sold over the counter. This is because these tablets have many listed side effects, contraindications and need to be taken for several months.
Antifungal nail paint
If you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your GP or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead.
Nail paint isn’t generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. However, it doesn’t usually cause any side effects.
Like antifungal tablets, antifungal nail paint also normally needs to be used for several months to ensure that the infection has cleared up.
Speak to your GP if new, healthy nail doesn’t start to grow after a few weeks of treatment.
Keep using the treatment until your GP says you can stop. Stopping too early could result in the infection returning.
Softening and scraping away the nail
As it can take a long time for antifungal medication to work, some people may prefer to use a treatment that involves softening and removing infected parts of nail over a few weeks.
Treatment kits are available from pharmacies that contain a 40% urea paste, plasters and a scraping device. The paste softens the infected parts of the nail, allowing them to be scraped away so they can be gradually replaced with healthy nail.
To use the treatment:
wash the affected area and dry it thoroughly
carefully apply the paste to the infected nails
cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours
wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail
repeat this process each day for 2 to 3 weeks
Once no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over the next few months.
Removing the nail
A procedure to remove affected nails completely isn’t usually necessary, but may be recommended if the infection is severe or painful and other treatments haven’t helped.
If your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. However, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely.
Laser treatment
Laser treatment is a possible option if you have a fungal nail infection that’s particularly stubborn. The laser emits high doses of light energy, which are used to destroy the fungus.
Early research suggests the treatment may be helpful in treating fungal nail infections, but there’s currently not enough evidence to recommend it as a routine treatment.
If you want to try laser treatment, you’ll have to pay for it privately because it’s not available on the NHS. Be aware that the treatment may need to be repeated several times for up to a year, so it could get very expensive.
How to prevent fungal nail infections
Whether or not you decide to have treatment, you should still follow self-help advice to help stop the condition getting worse or spreading to others.
Do
keep your hands and feet clean and dry
wear well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks – these will allow your feet to “breathe”
clip your nails to keep them short – don’t share clippers or scissors with other people
replace old footwear that could be contaminated with fungi
treat athlete’s foot as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails
ensure your towels are washed regularly
make sure any equipment is properly sterilised between uses if you visit a nail salon
Don’t
do not share towels and socks with other people
do not walk around barefoot in public pools, showers, and locker rooms – special shower shoes are available to protect your feet"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/germ-cell-tumours/,"Germ cell tumours
Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Germ cell tumours can appear at any age. They develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. However, it’s possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body.
As a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. However, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. The most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen.
Germ cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. These include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas.
They may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.
Benign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs.
Immature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. They can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation.
Causes
The cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is ongoing.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. Usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms.
How germ cell tumours are diagnosed
Different tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a
biopsy
) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not.
CT
or
MRI scans
may be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. Chest X-rays may be taken to see if there’s a tumour in the lungs.
Germ cell tumours often produce proteins called tumour markers that can be measured in the blood. The ones that are produced by germ cell tumours are alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Your child will have blood tests to check these tumour markers when they are being diagnosed. The doctors will continue to check these during treatment and after treatment is over.
Sometimes a germ cell tumour can be diagnosed with a tumour marker and scan results so that a biopsy isn’t necessary. This is particularly so if surgery is not needed for treatment, for example if the tumour is in the brain.
Staging
The stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread from where it started. Knowing the stage helps doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.
Generally cancer is divided into 4 stages:
stage 1 – the cancer is small, has not spread and has been completely removed
stages 2 and 3 – the cancer is larger and may not have been completely removed, or may have spread to nearby organs
stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body
Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.
Treatment
The treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. It usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination.
A benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. It may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started.
If the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery,
chemotherapy
is not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. If the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. It’s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein.
A combination of drugs is usually given every 3 weeks for 3 or 5 months. The length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of AFP, and whether or not the tumour has spread.
Treatment of malignant germ cell tumours in the brain is a little different. Although they are very sensitive to chemotherapy, treatment with radiotherapy is also needed.
Radiotherapy
is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. Unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it’s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. The operation your child has will be individually planned to try to reduce any possible problems. The surgeon and specialist nurse will discuss this with you.
The side effects of chemotherapy usually gradually improve when treatment is over and many of them can be well controlled.
The side effects of treatment depend on the drugs used but can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
hair loss
increased risk of infection
bruising and bleeding
tiredness
diarrhoea
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop long-term side effects of treatment, sometimes many years later. These are not common but may include problems with how the kidneys or lungs work and some hearing loss. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.
If your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they’ll usually still be able to have children in the future.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Your child will continue to have regular blood tests during and after treatment, to check their levels of AFP and HCG. If the levels rise, this indicates that the tumour might have come back and further treatment is needed.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support support your child."

About gallstones
Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases they don’t cause any symptoms and don’t need to be treated.
However, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic.
Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (
cholecystitis
), which can cause:
persistent pain
jaundice
a fever
When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it’s known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Read more about:
symptoms of gallstones
complications of gallstones
The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.
Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It’s passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder.
The bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.
What causes gallstones?
Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.
Gallstones are very common. It’s estimated that more than 1 in every 10 adults in the UK has gallstones, although only a minority of people develop symptoms.
You’re more at risk of developing gallstones if you’re:
overweight or obese
female, particularly if you’ve had children
40 or over (the risk increases as you get older)
Read more about:
causes of gallstones
preventing gallstones
Treating gallstones
Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing:
symptoms – such as
abdominal pain
complications – such as jaundice or
acute pancreatitis
In these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. This procedure, known as a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy
, is relatively simple to perform and has a low risk of complications.
You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than build up in the gallbladder.
Read more about:
treating gallstones
diagnosing gallstones
Outlook
Most cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery. Very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK.
Symptoms of gallstones
Most cases of gallstones don’t cause any symptoms. But if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic.
Other symptoms may develop if the blockage is more severe or develops in another part of the digestive system.
Abdominal pain (biliary colic)
Gallstones can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1 to 5 hours (although it can sometimes last just a few minutes).
The pain can be felt:
in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)
just under the ribs on your right-hand side – it may spread from here to your side or shoulder blade
The pain is constant and isn’t relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick. It’s sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but may occur at any time of day and it may wake you up during the night.
Biliary colic doesn’t happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode.
Some people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit.
When gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as ‘uncomplicated gallstone disease’.
Other symptoms
In a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel).
If this happens, you may develop:
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
more persistent pain
a rapid heartbeat
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
itchy skin
diarrhoea
chills or shivering attacks
confusion
a loss of appetite
Doctors refer to this more severe condition as ‘complicated gallstone disease’.
Read more about the
complications of gallstones
.
When to seek medical advice
If you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP.
Contact your GP immediately for advice if you develop:
jaundice
abdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours
a high temperature and chills
abdominal pain so intense that you can’t find a position to relieve it
If it’s not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local
out-of-hours
or NHS 24’s
111
service.
Causes of gallstones
Gallstones are thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion.
It’s still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if:
there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4 in every 5 gallstones are made up of cholesterol)
there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1 in every 5 gallstones is made up of bilirubin)
These chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble.
Sometimes only 1 stone will form, but there are often several at the same time.
Who’s at risk?
Gallstones are more common if you:
are female, particularly if you’ve had children, are taking the combined Pill, or are undergoing high-dose oestrogen therapy
are overweight or
obese
are aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones)
have a condition that affects the flow of bile – such as
cirrhosis
(scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, or
obstetric cholestasis
have
Crohn’s disease
or
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
have a close family member who’s also had gallstones
have recently lost weight (from either dieting or weight-loss surgery)
are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone
Diagnosing gallstones
Gallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don’t cause any symptoms.
If you do have
symptoms of gallstones
, make an appointment with your GP so they can try to identify the problem.
Seeing your GP
Your GP will ask about your symptoms in detail and may carry out the Murphy’s sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed.
During this test, your GP places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. If you find this painful, it usually means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment.
Your GP may also recommend having
blood tests
to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally. If gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to function properly.
Further tests
If your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you’ll usually be referred for further tests. You may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease.
Ultrasound scan
Gallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body.
The type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen.
Sound waves are sent from the transducer, through your skin and into your body. They bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image on a monitor. This is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
When gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct.
Gallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan. If they’re not visible but your tests suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an MRI scan or a cholangiography.
MRI scan
A
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
may be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.
Cholangiography
A procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder.
A cholangiography uses a dye that shows up on
X-rays
. The dye may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an endoscope passed through your mouth.
After the dye has been introduced, X-ray images are taken. They’ll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. If your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it’s meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder).
If a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove it at this point using an endoscope. This is known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). See
treating gallstones
for more information about ERCP.
CT scan
A
computerised tomography (CT) scan
may be carried out to look for any complications of gallstones, such as
acute pancreatitis
. This type of scan involves taking a series of X-rays from many different angles.
CT scans are often done in an emergency to diagnose severe abdominal pain.
Treating gallstones
Your treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life.
If you don’t have any symptoms, a policy of ‘active monitoring’ is often recommended. This means you won’t receive immediate treatment, but you should let your GP know if you notice any symptoms.
As a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse.
You may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of developing complications, such as:
scarring of the liver (
cirrhosis
)
high blood pressure inside the liver – this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of
alcohol-related liver disease
diabetes
Treatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to
gallbladder cancer
in later life.
If you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. If the episodes are mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about eating a healthy diet to help control the pain.
If your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently, surgery to remove the gallbladder is usually recommended.
The gallbladder isn’t an essential organ and you can lead a perfectly normal life without one. Some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. If certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.
Keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder
If surgery is recommended, you’ll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3 or 4 small cuts are made in your abdomen. One larger cut (about 2cm to 3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen.
Your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs.
A laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor. Your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments.
If it’s thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can’t be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery.
After the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually performed under a
general anaesthetic
, which means you’ll be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. The operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same day. Full recovery typically takes around 10 days.
Single-incision keyhole surgery
Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. During this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you’ll only have one barely visible scar.
However, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven’t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. Access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on
single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy
.
Open surgery
A laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you:
are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy
are extremely overweight
have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous
In these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. During this procedure, a 10cm to 15cm (4in to 6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed. This is done under general anaesthetic, so you’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain.
Open surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. Most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5 days and it typically takes 6 weeks to fully recover.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)
An endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. The gallbladder isn’t removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above.
ERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see
diagnosing gallstones
for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine.
However, during ERCP the opening of the bile duct is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body.
Sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass.
An ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you’ll be awake throughout the procedure but won’t experience any pain.
The ERCP procedure lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour. You may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored.
Medication to dissolve gallstones
If your gallstones are small and don’t contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid tablets to dissolve them.
However, these aren’t prescribed very often because:
they’re rarely very effective
they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2 years)
gallstones can recur once treatment is stopped
Side effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin.
The use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Sexually active women should use either a barrier method of
contraception
, such as a
condom
, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills.
Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it’s thought you’re at risk of developing them. For example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you’ve recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.
Complications of gallstones
A small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system.
Inflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis)
In some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. This can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed.
The medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder is acute cholecystitis. Symptoms include:
pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours)
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a rapid heartbeat
An estimated 1 in 7 people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below).
Acute cholecystitis is usually treated first with
antibiotics
to settle the infection and then
keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder
. This operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there’s a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure.
Sometimes a severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). Antibiotics alone don’t always treat these and they may need to be drained.
Occasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder can tear, leading to peritonitis (inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen). If this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged.

acute cholecystitis
.
Jaundice
If a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs.
Symptoms of jaundice include:
yellowing of the skin and eyes
dark brown urine
pale stools
itching
Sometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. If it doesn’t, the stone needs to be removed. See
treating gallstones
.
Infection of the bile ducts (acute cholangitis)
If the bile ducts become blocked, they’re vulnerable to infection by bacteria. The medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis.
Symptoms of acute cholangitis include:
pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade
a high temperature
jaundice
chills
confusion
itchy skin
generally feeling unwell
Antibiotics will help treat the infection, but it’s also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). Read
treating gallstones
for more information.
Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis
may develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed.
The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach.
The pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. The ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain.
Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:
feeling sick
being sick
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
tenderness of the abdomen
less commonly, jaundice
There’s currently no cure for acute pancreatitis, so treatment focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.
This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given:
fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids)
pain relief
nutritional support
oxygen through tubes into your nose
With treatment, most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.

acute pancreatitis

Cancer of the gallbladder
Gallbladder cancer
is a rare but serious complication of gallstones. An estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.
Having a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer. Approximately 4 out of every 5 people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones.
However, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer.
If you have additional risk factors, such as a family history of gallbladder cancer or high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, it may be recommended that your gallbladder be removed as a precaution, even if your gallstones aren’t causing any symptoms.
The symptoms of gallbladder cancer are similar to those of complicated gallstone disease, including:
abdominal pain
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
jaundice
Gallbladder cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery,
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
.
Gallstone ileus
Another rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. This is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone.
Gallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. Gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel.
Symptoms of gallstone ileus include:
abdominal pain
being sick
swelling of the abdomen
constipation
A bowel obstruction requires immediate medical treatment. If it’s not treated, there’s a risk that the bowel could split open (rupture). This could cause internal bleeding and widespread infection.
If you suspect you have an obstructed bowel, contact your GP as soon as possible. If this isn’t possible, phone the
NHS 24 111 service
.
Surgery is usually required to remove the gallstone and unblock the bowel. The type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred.
Preventing gallstones
From the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you’re overweight) may help prevent gallstones.
Diet
Because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods with a high saturated fat content.
Foods high in saturated fat include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter, ghee and lard
cream
hard cheeses
cakes and biscuits
food containing coconut or palm oil
A healthy, balanced diet is recommended. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and wholegrains.
There’s also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.
Drinking small amounts of alcohol may also help reduce your risk of gallstones. However, you shouldn’t regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week as this can lead to liver problems and other health conditions. Regularly drinking any amount of alcohol can increase the risk to your health.

Losing weight
Being overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise.
However, avoid low-calorie, rapid-weight-loss diets. There’s evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is recommended.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/gastroenteritis/,"Gastroenteritis
Gastroenteritis is a very common condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting. It’s usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug.
It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children.
Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by
norovirus
(the ‘winter vomiting bug’) or bacterial
food poisoning
.
Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you’re feeling better.
Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Phone
111
or your GP if you’re concerned or need any advice.
Symptoms of gastroenteritis
The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are:
sudden, watery
diarrhoea
feeling sick
vomiting, which can be projectile
a mild fever
Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an
upset stomach
, aching limbs and headaches.
The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer.
What to do if you have gastroenteritis
If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you’re feeling better. There’s not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course.
You don’t usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don’t improve or there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
There are things you can do to help ease your symptoms.
Do
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration; you need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup
take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains
get plenty of rest
if you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread
use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine
take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to – some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine; you can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they’re suitable
Read further information about treating dehydration
Gastroenteritis can spread very easily. You should wash your hands regularly while you’re ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on.
When to get medical advice
You don’t normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own.
Visiting your GP practice can put others at risk, so it’s best to phone 111 or your GP if you’re concerned or feel you need advice.
Phone 111 or your GP practice if:
you have
symptoms of severe dehydration
, such as persistent
dizziness
, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you’re losing consciousness
you have bloody diarrhoea
you’re vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids
you have a fever over 38C (100.4F)
your symptoms haven’t started to improve after a few days
in the last few weeks you’ve returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation
you have a serious underlying condition, such as
kidney disease
, inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what’s causing your symptoms.
Antibiotics
may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection.
Looking after a child with gastroenteritis
You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There’s not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days.
You don’t normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don’t improve or there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
There are things you can do to help ease your child’s symptoms.
Do
encourage them to drink plenty of fluids as they need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – water is generally best; avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse
babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds
make sure they get plenty of rest
let your child eat if they’re eating solids and feel hungry – try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread
give them paracetamol if they have an uncomfortable fever or aches and pains – young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets
use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they’re dehydrated – your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child
Don’t give your child antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist.
Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill. Keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared.
Getting medical advice for your child
You don’t usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP practice can put others at risk.
Phone 111 or your GP practice if:
You’re concerned about your child, or they:
have
symptoms of dehydration
, such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet
have blood in their poo or green vomit
are vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids or feeds
have had diarrhoea for more than a week
have been vomiting for 3 days or more
have signs of a more serious illness, such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn’t fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby’s head)
have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child’s poo to a laboratory to confirm what’s causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection.
How gastroenteritis is spread
The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person.
You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through:
close contact with someone with gastroenteritis – they may breathe out small particles of vomit
touching contaminated surfaces or objects
eating contaminated food – this can happen if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn’t been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures
A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.
Preventing gastroenteritis
It’s not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following this advice can help stop it spreading.
Do
stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed – you or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time
ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not always effective
disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated – it’s best to use a bleach-based household cleaner
wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash
flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area
practice good food hygiene: make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date
Don’t
do not rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not always effective
don’t share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill
Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it.
Young children can have the
rotavirus vaccination
when they’re 2 to 3 months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/functional-neurological-disorder/,"Functional neurological disorder
Functional neurological disorder (FND) describes a problem with how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.
It’s often helpful to think of your brain as a computer. In someone who has FND, there’s no damage to the hardware, or structure, of the brain. It’s the software, or program running on the computer, that isn’t working properly.
The problems that cause FND are going on in a level of the brain that you cannot control. It includes symptoms like arm and leg weakness and seizures. Other symptoms like fatigue or pain are not directly caused by FND, but are often found alongside it.
Symptoms of FND
FND can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many.
A diagnosis of FND should be made because you have one or more clinical features that a specialist can recognise as typical of FND. It shouldn’t be made just because scans or tests for other neurological conditions that have similar symptoms are normal.
What is a clinical feature?
A clinical feature is a distinctive way that your symptom presents that is unique to FND. For example, it could be that your eyes close during seizures, or that limb weakness briefly disappears during certain physical tests. Clinical features are what specialists use to identify FND from other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.
Functional limb weakness
Functional limb weakness is when a leg or an arm doesn’t work properly. In FND, this happens because of a problem with how the nervous system is functioning.
It can cause a range of symptoms, including:
problems walking
heaviness down one side
dropping things
feeling like a limb isn’t part of you
Functional limb weakness can often look a symptoms of a
stroke
or
multiple sclerosis.
If you have FND, any scans you have will show no damage to the brain to explain the weakness.
A specialist will diagnose functional limb weakness based on specific clinical features (symptoms) they find when they examine you.
Read more about functional limb weakness
Functional seizures
A functional seizure (also called a dissociative seizure) is an episode where someone loses either their awareness of, or their ability to interact with, their surroundings. It may look like an
epileptic seizure
or a faint.
A functional seizure can appear as:
uncontrolled shaking
suddenly going motionless and unresponsive
staring without responding to surroundings
Some people are aware that seizures are about to happen, while others experience them without warning.
A specialist will ask you and your friends or family about what happens during a seizure, and will look at any video footage you can provide. They’ll use this evidence to decide if it’s
epilepsy
, a faint or a functional seizure.
Read more about functional seizures
Functional tremor
Tremor is uncontrollable shaking of part of the body. It’s most often found in the arms and legs.
Functional tremor can come and go throughout the day, and change in speed and strength.
A specialist will diagnose functional tremor based on specific features of your symptoms that they find when they examine you.
Read more about functional tremor
Functional dystonia
Functional dystonia is a type of muscle spasm. It causes a part of the body to become stuck in an unusual position. This can be for a short or a long period of time.
Someone with functional dystonia will often present with curled fingers, a clenched hand, or an ankle that turns in.
Read more about functional dystonia
Functional gait disorder
Functional gait disorder describes the problems walking that you may experience as part of FND.
You may find you have a dragging leg, that you feel unsteady when walking, or that you make excessive movements when walking.
A specialist will diagnose functional gait disorder based on clinical features, like the way your walking changes when doing different activities.
Read more about functional gait disorder
Functional facial spasm
Functional facial spasm is when there are muscle spasms in the face. These can lead to problems like a narrowing of the eye or the pulling of the mouth or jaw upwards, downwards or to the side.
Read more about functional facial spasm
Functional tics
A tic is a fast repetitive movement or sound that happens suddenly. Functional tics can be a symptom of FND.
Functional tics can look similar to the tics in Tourette’s syndrome. A specialist will look at the clinical features of your tics to make a diagnosis. It’s quite common to have both functional tics and Tourette’s syndrome.
Functional jerks and twitches
A symptom of FND can be jerks or twitches, which is when someone makes sudden movements.
Everyone experiences random jerks occasionally, like when you jolt awake as you’re falling asleep. In FND, however, these uncontrolled jerks and twitches can become much more frequent.
Read more about functional jerks and twitches
Functional drop attacks
Functional drop attacks are when someone falls to the ground suddenly, without losing consciousness.
Read more about functional drop attacks
Functional sensory symptoms
A symptom of FND can be numbness, pins and needles, or a feeling that a limb isn’t part of your body.
Read more about functional sensory symptoms
Functional cognitive symptoms
Problems with your memory or concentration can be a symptom of FND.
You might find that you:
lose track while doing things, for example being unable to remember why you went into a room
go blank, for example when trying to recall your pin number
lose track during conversations
misplace important things, like your keys or phone
forget words
It’s normal to experience these things occasionally. For someone with functional cognitive symptoms, these things happen so often that they interfere with work and home life.
The cognitive symptoms of FND can sometimes be mistaken for
dementia.
Specialists will look for features that are typical of functional cognitive symptoms when diagnosing FND.
Read more about functional cognitive symptoms
Functional speech and swallowing difficulties
Functional speech and swallowing difficulties can be a symptom of FND. You might experience:
slurred speech
a new stutter
difficulties finding the right word
unintentionally mixing words up
whispering or hoarse speech (dysphonia)
difficulty swallowing, including feeling like there’s something stuck in your throat
A specialist will diagnose functional speech and swallowing difficulties based on specific features.
Read more about functional speech and swallowing difficulties
Persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD)
PPPD (sometimes called functional dizziness, triple PD or 3PD) can be a symptom of FND.
The dizziness in PPPD is typically experienced constantly, and gets worse while walking or in crowded environments.
There are many causes of dizziness. Most people with PPPD have another cause of dizziness at the same time. A specialist will diagnose PPPD based on specific features when they assess you.
Read more about PPPD
Functional visual symptoms
Visual symptoms can be a part of FND. You may experience changes to your vision, like:

Dissociative symptoms
Dissociative symptoms are common in FND, although there are many other causes. These symptoms can be hard to describe, but are often described as feeling:
that your body is disconnected from you
that your body doesn’t belong to you
disconnected from the world around you
spaced out
that you are floating
that you are having an out-of-body experience
there but not there
You may also be able to hear what’s going on around you, but not be able to respond.
These experiences are called dissociation, and can link into other FND symptoms.
Read more about dissociative symptoms
There are other symptoms or conditions that are commonly associated with FND. These include:
chronic pain
, including
fibromyalgia
, back and neck pain, and complex regional pain syndrome
persistent
fatigue
sleep problems including
insomnia
(not sleeping enough) and hypersomnia (sleeping too much)
migraines
and other types of
headache
and facial pain
irritable bowel syndrome
and other problems with the function of your stomach and bowel
anxiety
and
panic attacks
depression
post-traumatic stress disorder
chronic urinary retention
despite all tests being normal (which may be diagnosed as
Fowlers syndrome)
dysfunctional breathing
What causes FND?
We know that the symptoms of FND happen because there’s a problem with how the brain is sending and receiving messages to itself and other parts of the body. Using research tools, scientists can see that certain circuits in the brain are not working properly in people with FND.
However, there’s still a lot of research to be done to understand how and why FND happens.
Why does FND happen?
FND can happen for a wide range of reasons. There’s often more than one reason, and the reasons can vary hugely from person to person.
Some of the reasons why the brain stops working properly in FND include:
the brain trying to get rid of a painful sensation
a migraine or other neurological symptom
the brain shutting down a part or all of the body in response to a situation it thinks is threatening
In some people, stressful events in the past or present can be relevant to FND. In others, stress is not relevant.
The risk of developing FND increases if you have another neurological condition.
Read more about how and why FND happens.
Diagnosing FND
When diagnosing FND, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of FND.
Your healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing FND. This is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, FND is present alongside another neurological condition. Someone can have both FND and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (MS).
The diagnosis of FND, however, should be given because you have the clinical features of FND. It shouldn’t be given just because there’s no evidence of other conditions or illnesses.
Because the symptoms of FND are not always there, your healthcare provider may ask you to video your symptoms. This will allow them to see what your symptoms look like.
Treatments
FND is a really variable condition. Some people have quite short-lived symptoms. Others can have them for many years.
There are treatments available that can manage and improve FND. These treatments are all forms of rehabilitation therapy, which aims to improve your ability to carry out every day activities. Many of these treatments are designed to ‘retrain the brain’. Some people with FND benefit a lot from treatment and may go into remission. Other people continue to have FND symptoms despite treatment.
Physiotherapy
Specialised physiotherapy can be useful in treating FND. It helps to remind the body how it should move. It can also help you build up strength and stamina you may have lost.
Read more about physiotherapy for FND
Occupational therapy
Occupational therapy can be helpful in treating FND. An occupational therapist will work with you to plan your treatment goals, and gradually build your confidence and ability to reach them.
Read more about occupational therapy for FND
Psychological therapy
Psychological therapy can be helpful to many people with FND, even those without stress in their lives. It can help you gain a better understanding of FND and its relationship to your personal circumstances.
There are specific psychological techniques which can help you gain better control over movement or seizure symptoms. Psychological therapy can also help you learn to manage low mood, anxiety and past traumatic events, as well as other psychological problems (if present).
Not everyone with FND will need psychological therapy.
Read more about psychological therapy for FND
Speech, language and swallowing therapy
Speech and language therapists are available to help if you’re struggling with speaking or swallowing. They have a range of techniques to try, designed to help with specific problems. These might include helping you to shape certain sounds, or to practice breathing patterns as you try to talk.
Read more about speech and language therapy for FND
Medication
Medication can play a role in treating the some of the problems associated with FND, like pain, depression and anxiety. Your healthcare provider can help decide if medication is right for you.
There are many types of medication that can make FND worse, including opiates like morphine, dihydrocodeine or codeine. It may be worth discussing your current medications with your healthcare provider.
Do not stop taking any medicine that’s been prescribed without checking with your GP or healthcare provider first. You could make yourself very ill.
Read more about treating FND
FND in children and young people
FND is broadly the same condition in children and young people. It’s unusual for it to occur under the age of 10. It becomes more common through the teenage years.
The treatment for FND in children and young people is similar to adults. It’s especially important for families and schools to learn about the condition, so they can respond in the most helpful way.
Where to find support
If you’ve been diagnosed with FND there are sources of information, charities and support groups that can help you.
The
Neurosymptoms FND Guide
has more detailed information. There’s also an app available with further details about the condition.
My FND
is an app that allows you to learn about your symptoms. It helps you track them, and offers advice for managing them.
FND Hope UK
is a charity that raises awareness of FND. It provides further information, resources, and support services for those with FND.

About gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet).
It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the
causes of GORD
.
GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem.
GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed.
This topic focuses on GORD in adults.
Symptoms of GORD
Symptoms of GORD can include:
heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating)
acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste)
oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus)
bad breath
bloating and belching
feeling or being sick
pain when swallowing and/or
difficulty swallowing
Read more about the
symptoms of GORD
.
What to do if you have GORD
You can often control the symptoms of GORD by making some lifestyle changes and taking over-the-counter medication.
Read
treatments for GORD
for more information.
You don’t necessarily need to see your GP if you only have symptoms occasionally. Ask your pharmacist for advice on treatments.
When to see your GP
Visit your GP if you’re worried about your symptoms, or if:
you have symptoms several times a week
over-the-counter medications aren’t helping
your symptoms are severe
you have difficulty swallowing
you have possible signs of a more serious problem, such as persistent vomiting, vomiting blood or unexplained weight loss
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose GORD based on your symptoms, although they may refer you for some tests.
Read more about
diagnosing GORD
.
Treatments for GORD
The main treatments for GORD are:
self-help measures – this includes eating smaller but more frequent meals, avoiding any foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms, raising the head of your bed, and keeping to a healthy weight
over-the-counter medicines – ask your pharmacist to recommend an antacid or an alginate
stronger prescription medicines – including proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)
You may only need to take medication when you experience symptoms, although long-term treatment may be needed if the problem continues.
Surgery to stop stomach acid leaking into your oesophagus may be recommended if medication isn’t helping, or you don’t want to take medication on a long-term basis.
Read more about the
treatments for GORD
.
Complications of GORD
If you have GORD for a long time, stomach acid can damage your oesophagus and cause further problems.
These include:
ulcers (sores) on the oesophagus – these may bleed and make swallowing painful
the oesophagus becoming scarred and narrowed – this can make swallowing difficult and may require an operation to correct it
changes in the cells lining the oesophagus (Barrett’s oesophagus) – very occasionally,
oesophageal cancer
can develop from these cells, so you may need to be closely monitored
Read more about the
complications of GORD
.
Symptoms of GORD
The main symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are heartburn and acid reflux.
Heartburn
Heartburn is an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest.
It’s usually felt just below your breastbone, but can spread up to the throat in some people.
The discomfort is usually worse after eating, or when bending over or lying down.
Acid reflux
Acid reflux is where acid and other stomach contents are brought back up (regurgitated) into your throat and mouth.
It usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the back of your mouth.
Other symptoms
If you have GORD, you may also experience:
a sore, inflamed oesophagus (oesophagitis)
bad breath
bloating and belching
feeling or being sick
difficulty swallowing
, which may feel like a piece of food is stuck low down in your throat
pain when swallowing
a
sore throat
and hoarseness
a persistent
cough
or wheezing, which may be worse at night
tooth decay
and
gum disease
If you also have
asthma
, the symptoms may get worse as a result of stomach acid irritating your airways.
Causes of GORD
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is usually caused by the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus (gullet) becoming weakened.
Normally, this ring of muscle opens to let food into your stomach and closes to stop stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus.
But for people with GORD, stomach acid is able to pass back up into the oesophagus. This causes
symptoms of GORD
, which can include heartburn and acid reflux.
It’s not always clear what causes this ring of muscle to become weakened, but certain things can increase the risk of it happening.
Who’s most at risk of GORD?
The following factors may increase your risk of developing GORD:
being overweight or
obese
– this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus
eating large amounts of fatty foods – the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus
smoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate – these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus
pregnancy – temporary changes in hormone levels and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause GORD
hiatus hernia
– when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy)
gastroparesis – when the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid, which means excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus
certain medicines – some medicines can cause GORD or make the symptoms worse, including calcium-channel blockers (used to treat
high blood pressure
), nitrates (used to treat
angina
) and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
stress
GORD can sometimes affect several members of the same family and it’s been suggested that the genes you inherit from your parents may also affect your chances of developing the condition.
Diagnosing GORD
Your GP will often be able to diagnose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) based on your symptoms.
They may prescribe medication to treat it without needing to carry out any tests. Read more about
treating GORD
.
When tests may be needed
You’ll usually only need to be referred for tests in hospital if:
your GP is unsure whether you have GORD
your symptoms are persistent, severe or unusual
prescription medications aren’t controlling your symptoms
your GP thinks you might benefit from surgery
you have signs of a potentially more severe condition, such as
difficulty swallowing
or unexplained weight loss
Tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of GORD, check for other possible causes of your symptoms and determine whether you may be suitable for surgery.
Tests for GORD
Tests you may have include:
an endoscopy
a barium swallow or barium meal test
manometry
24-hour pH monitoring
blood tests
Endoscopy
An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using an endoscope, which is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end.
The endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. The procedure is usually carried out while you’re awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax.
The camera can show if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn’t happen to everyone with GORD.
Barium swallow or barium meal
A barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus.
You are first given some barium solution, then some
X-rays
are taken. Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system.
You’ll be asked not to eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body.
Manometry
Manometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus.
This can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and can help determine whether surgery would be suitable.
During the procedure, a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus.
24-hour pH monitoring
It may be necessary to measure the acidity level (pH) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of GORD if nothing is found during an endoscopy.
The acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that’s passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist.
You’ll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. You should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result.
Blood tests
Sometimes a
blood test
may be carried out to check for
anaemia
, which can be a sign of internal bleeding.
Treating GORD
Heartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines.
If these don’t help, your GP can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option.
Self-help
You may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of GORD:
eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day – don’t eat or drink alcohol within 3 or 4 hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening
avoid anything you think triggers your symptoms – common triggers include coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol, and fatty or spicy food
don’t wear tight clothing – clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse
raise the head of your bed by up to 20cm (8 inches) – placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed may reduce symptoms at night; don’t just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy
try to relax – stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning
relaxation techniques
may help if you’re often feeling stressed
maintain a healthy weight – if you’re overweight,
losing weight
may help reduce your symptoms
stop smoking
– smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse
If you’re taking medication for other health conditions, check with your GP to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms.
Different medicines may be available, but don’t stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first.
Medication
A number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of GORD.
Over-the-counter medicines
Over-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are:
antacids – these neutralise the effects of stomach acid
alginates – these produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid
low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists – see below for more information about these
These medicines aren’t suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you’re not sure.
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)
If your symptoms don’t get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe a PPI. These work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach.
You’ll usually be given enough medication to last a month. Go back to your GP if they don’t help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes. Some people need to take PPIs on a long-term basis.
The possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches,
diarrhoea
or
constipation
, feeling sick,
abdominal pain
, dizziness and a rash.
Your GP will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects.
H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)
If PPIs don’t control your symptoms, a medicine known as a H2RA may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative.
Like PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by your stomach.
Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a rash and tiredness.
Surgery and procedures
Surgery may be an option if:
the above treatments don’t help, aren’t suitable for you, or cause troublesome side effects
you don’t want to take medication on a long-term basis
The main procedure used is called a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). Alternative techniques have been developed more recently, although these aren’t yet widely available.
Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF)
LNF is a type of laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. This means it’s carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin.
The procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus, which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It’s carried out in hospital under
general anaesthetic
.
Most people need to stay in hospital for 2 or 3 days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks.
For the first 6 weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF, but these should get better with time.
Newer operations and procedures
In the last few years, several new techniques for treating GORD have been developed.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
says these procedures appear to be safe, but not much is known about their long-term effects.
These techniques include:
Endoscopic injection of bulking agents
– where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower.
Endoluminal gastroplication
– where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open.
Endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants
– where implants containing special gel are placed into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower.
Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation
– where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower.
Laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX)
– where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing.
Speak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information.
Complications of GORD
A number of possible complications can occur as a result of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for a long time.
Oesophageal ulcers
The stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with GORD can damage the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form.
These ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow.
Medications used to treat GORD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. Read more about
treatments for GORD
.
Scarred and narrow oesophagus
Repeated damage to the oesophagus by stomach acid can also cause it to become scarred and narrowed.
This is known as oesophageal stricture and it can make swallowing difficult and painful.
If this happens, a procedure to widen the oesophagus using a small balloon or other widening device may be recommended.
Barrett’s oesophagus
Repeated episodes of GORD can sometimes lead to changes in the cells in the lining of your lower oesophagus. This is known as Barrett’s oesophagus.
It’s estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett’s oesophagus, usually after many years.
Barrett’s oesophagus doesn’t usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those caused by GORD.
However, there’s a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). Your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy every few years to check for this.
Oesophageal cancer
It’s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop
oesophageal cancer
within 10 to 20 years.
Symptoms of oesophageal cancer include:
difficulty swallowing
unexplained weight loss
persistent
indigestion
hoarseness
a persistent
cough
and/or coughing blood
vomiting
Speak to your doctor if you experience any swallowing difficulties, or any other unusual or persistent symptoms.
Surgery to remove the cancer can be carried out if it’s diagnosed at an early stage.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/genital-herpes/,"Genital herpes
Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV).
There are 2 different types of the virus. Both of which affect the genitals.
Genital herpes causes painful blisters and sores on and around the genitals. It can also sometimes cause problems if you have it for the first time during pregnancy.
Symptoms of genital herpes
Most people with the herpes virus don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do get symptoms, it takes usually 2 to 12 days after contact for them to appear. Some people don’t get symptoms until months or sometimes years later.
Once you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If this happens, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a ‘recurrent episode’ of genital herpes.
This first episode of genital herpes may last from 2 to 4 weeks.
Repeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode.
Symptoms of the first infection include:
spots or red bumps around the genital area
pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus
vaginal discharge
pain peeing or being unable to pee
fever
flu-like symptoms, backache, headache and a temperature
mild swelling of the lymph glands in the groin, armpits and neck
If you have a recurrent infection, your symptoms may include:
a tingling or burning sensation before blisters appear
painful red blisters, which soon burst to leave ulcers
pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice or midwife if:
you’re pregnant and think you have genital herpes
Testing for genital herpes
If you think you might have genital herpes, get tested for free by:
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
Your doctor or nurse may be able to diagnose by looking at symptoms such as blisters, sores and ulcers.
If you have visible blisters, your doctor or nurse may take a swab for testing. This is to check if it’s herpes and what type. The swab can also test for another STI which causes blisters called
syphilis
.
The genital herpes swab tests are very reliable, though if the ulcer is too dry then it may be less likely to find a positive result.
Treatment for genital herpes
Genital herpes can be treated with antiviral medication.
The symptoms of genital herpes can be treated, although it could keep coming back.
Symptoms of recurrent genital herpes will usually clear up without any treatment.
Some people experience recurrences of genital herpes. In these cases, a longer course of tablets should stop any recurrent episodes.
You can talk to your GP or nurse about which treatment options are right for you.
As there’s no screening test for herpes, partners should only have a test if they also have symptoms.
How genital herpes are passed on
You can get genital herpes:
from skin to skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex)
when there are no visible sores or blisters
if a
cold sore
touches your genitals or face
kissing (if the person has a
cold sore
on their face)
by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes
Sometimes herpes can be passed on when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called ‘asymptomatic shedding’.
This risk goes down during the first months after you catch herpes and is not likely after two years. However, it is more common when people are still having frequent recurrences.
Very rarely, herpes is passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is only likely to happen if a mother has her first episode of herpes after week 26 of the pregnancy. When women have had herpes longer than three months, normal delivery is expected even if there are symptoms at the time of delivery.
How to prevent genital herpes
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If your partner has herpes, avoiding sex when they have visible sores reduces your risk of getting herpes.
Other STIs
If you’ve been diagnosed with herpes it’s recommended that you are tested for all STIs including:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV
This is even more important if you have recurrent episodes.
Find your local sexual health clinic"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/genital-warts/,"Genital warts
Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).
They are caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).
Symptoms of genital warts
It can take a few weeks or months for genital warts to appear after becoming infected.
Genital warts are usually small, rough lumps on the skin.
They can appear:
around the vagina and on the penis
around the anus
on the skin between the genitals and the anus
Genital warts may:
appear on their own or in a group (groups of warts can look like a cauliflower)
feel soft or firm
be white, red, skin-coloured, or darker than the surrounding skin
They don’t usually cause symptoms but can sometimes be painful, itchy or bleed.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if you have:
1 or more painless lumps or growths around your vagina, penis or anus
itching or bleeding from your genitals or anus
a sexual partner (s) who has genital warts
Testing for genital warts
The test for genital warts involves an examination of the genital area.
If you think you might have genital warts, get checked for free by:
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
Warts must be diagnosed by a doctor or nurse.
Treatment for genital warts
Treatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months.
If treatment is recommended, it’ll be prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor or nurse may advise you to avoid sex while you’re having treatment for genital warts.
The type of treatment you’ll be offered depends on what your warts are like. Your doctor or nurse will discuss this with you.
Treatment options include:
cream or liquid
freezing
surgery
Cream or liquid
You can usually apply this to the warts yourself a few times a week for several weeks.
Freezing
A doctor or nurse freezes the warts with liquid nitrogen, usually every week for 4 weeks.
Surgery
A doctor or nurse can cut or burn the warts off. This is usually only recommended if the warts are not responding or are too large for cream or freezing. Side effects of these treatments include:
bleeding
wound infection
scarring
Genital warts and pregnancy
Genital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy.
During pregnancy, genital warts may:
multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they’re very big)
become more easily irritated
be passed on to the baby during childbirth, but this is very rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby’s throat or genitals)
Most creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy. Freezing can be used but it’s often not very successful.
Genital warts usually disappear on their own within 6 weeks after childbirth.
How genital warts are passed on
You can get genital warts from skin to skin contact.
Other ways of getting genital warts include:
unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex (sex without a condom)
sharing sex toys with an infected person
How to prevent genital warts
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and when sharing sex toys.
You can get warts even if you use condoms, as a condom does not cover the whole genital area.
The
HPV vaccination
will reduce your risk of getting HPV virus which causes warts. However, it doesn’t treat warts once you have them.
HPV and cancer
Genital warts are not cancer and don’t cause cancer. They’re caused by a different strain of HPV.
HPV vaccination
is offered to every person aged 11 to 13. The vaccine can protect against cervical cancer also protects against genital warts.
The HPV vaccine is
also offered to men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans people aged up to 45 years
.
If you didn’t have the vaccine at school and don’t fulfill the above criteria, you can pay for the vaccine privately.
Other STIs
If you’ve been diagnosed with genital warts it’s recommended that you’re tested for all STIs including:

Mouth cancer is the most common type of head and neck cancer.
It can affect a number of areas in and around the mouth, including the:
lips
tongue
inside of the cheeks
floor or roof of the mouth
gums
Symptoms of mouth cancer can include persistent
mouth ulcers
and/or a lump in your mouth, both of which may be painful.

Laryngeal cancer
Laryngeal cancer develops in the tissue of the larynx (voice box).
Symptoms of laryngeal cancer can include:
a change in the voice, such as persistent hoarseness
difficulty or pain when swallowing
noisy breathing
shortness of breath
a persistent
cough
a lump or swelling in your neck
Read more about
laryngeal cancer
.
Throat cancers
Doctors don’t tend to use the term throat cancer, as the throat (pharynx) includes many different parts that can be affected by cancer.
The main areas that can be affected are the:
oropharynx – the part of the throat at the back of the mouth
hypopharynx – the part of the throat connecting the oropharynx to the gullet and windpipe
nasopharynx – the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (see below)
The most common symptoms of cancer in the oropharynx or hypopharynx include a lump in the neck, a persistent
sore throat
and difficulty swallowing.

.
Salivary gland cancer
Salivary glands produce saliva, which keeps your mouth moist and helps with swallowing and digestion.
There are 3 main pairs of salivary glands. They are the:
parotid glands – located between your cheeks and your ears
sublingual glands – located under your tongue
submandibular glands – located under each side of your jawbone
Salivary gland cancer most commonly affects the parotid glands.
The main symptom of salivary gland cancer is a lump or swelling on or near your jaw, or in your mouth or neck, although the vast majority of these lumps are non-cancerous. Other symptoms can include numbness in part of your face and drooping on one side of your face.

Nose and sinus cancer
Nose and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (above the roof of your mouth) and the sinuses (the small, air-filled cavities inside the bones of the nose and within the cheekbones and forehead).
The symptoms of nose and sinus cancer are similar to viral or bacterial infections, such as the
common cold
or
sinusitis
, and include:
a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects one side
nosebleeds
a decreased sense of smell
mucus running from the nose or down the throat

nose and sinus cancer
.
Nasopharyngeal cancer
Nasopharyngeal cancer affects the part of the throat that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It’s one of the rarest types of head and neck cancer in the UK.
Symptoms can include:
a lump in the neck, due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes (pea-sized lumps of tissue that make up part of the immune system) in the neck
a blocked or stuffy nose
nosebleeds
hearing loss
(usually only in one ear)

About glandular fever
Glandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults.
It’s also known as infectious mononucleosis, or ‘mono’.
Common symptoms include:
a high temperature (fever)
a severely
sore throat
swollen glands
in the neck
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within 2 to 3 weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months.
Read more about the
symptoms of glandular fever
.
When to seek medical advice
You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever.
While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others.
You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you:
develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties
find swallowing fluids difficult
develop intense abdominal pain
These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital.

Self-help guide: Fever in adults
What causes glandular fever?
Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through:
kissing – glandular fever is often referred to as the ‘kissing disease’
exposure to coughs and sneezes
sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery
EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.
If you have EBV, it’s a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there’s no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low.
Read more about the
causes of glandular fever
.
Who is affected?
Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults.
Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.
However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever.
Once you have had glandular fever, it’s unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection.
How glandular fever is diagnosed
To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They’ll look for signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen.
Your GP may also recommend a
blood test
to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis.
How glandular fever is treated
There is no cure for glandular fever. But there are simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection.
These include:
drinking plenty of fluids
taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve
Occasionally,
antibiotics
or
corticosteroids
may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever.
Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.
Read more about
treating glandular fever
.
Possible complications
Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include:
further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs
severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells)
breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen
a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery
Read more about the
complications of glandular fever
.
Symptoms of glandular fever
Symptoms of glandular fever are thought to take around 1 to 2 months to develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
Main symptoms
The most common symptoms of the condition are:
a high temperature (fever)
a
sore throat
– this is usually more painful than any you may have had before
swollen glands
in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
Other symptoms
Glandular fever can also cause:
a general sense of feeling unwell
aching muscles
chills
sweats
loss of appetite
pain around or behind your eyes
swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing
the inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid
small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth
a rash
swelling or ‘puffiness’ around your eyes
a tender or swollen tummy
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
Some of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms mentioned above.
How the condition progresses
Most symptoms of glandular fever will usually resolve within 2 or 3 weeks. Your throat will normally feel most sore for 3 to 5 days after symptoms start before gradually improving, and your fever will usually last 10 to 14 days.
Fatigue is the most persistent symptom and often lasts a few weeks, although some people may feel persistently fatigued for several months after the other symptoms have passed.
When to seek medical advice
You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever.
While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment other than provide advice and support,
blood tests
may be needed to rule out less common but more serious causes of your symptoms, such as hepatitis (a viral infection that affects the liver).
You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you:
develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties
find swallowing fluids difficult
develop intense abdominal pain
If you have these symptoms, you may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.

Causes of glandular fever
Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is most often spread through the saliva of someone who carries the infection.
For example, it can be spread through:
kissing – glandular fever is sometimes referred to as the ‘kissing disease’
sharing food and drinks
sharing toothbrushes
exposure to coughs and sneezes
Small children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus.
When you come into contact with infected saliva, the virus can infect the cells on the lining of your throat.
The infection is then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system.
This is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body.
After the infection has passed, people develop lifelong immunity to the virus and most won’t develop symptoms again.
Many people are first exposed to EBV during childhood, when the infection causes few symptoms and often goes unrecognised before it eventually passes.
Young adults may be most at risk of glandular fever because they might not have been exposed to the virus when they were younger, and the infection tends to produce more severe symptoms when you’re older.
EBV carriers
Not everyone who can pass on EBV will have symptoms themselves. These are known as asymptomatic carriers.
Some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.
This is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. For most people, the inactive virus won’t cause any symptoms.
However, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. This reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.
Treating glandular fever
There is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help control your symptoms.
Fluids
Drink plenty of fluids (preferably water or unsweetened fruit juice) to avoid
dehydration
.
Avoid alcohol, as this could harm your liver, which may already be weakened from the infection.
Painkillers
Painkillers available over the counter, such as
paracetamol
or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
such as
ibuprofen
, can help reduce pain and fever.
Children under 16 years old should not take aspirin because there is a small risk it could trigger a rare but serious health condition called Reye’s syndrome.
Regularly gargling with a solution of warm, salty water may also help relieve your
sore throat
.
Rest
Take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it may make the fatigue last longer.
You should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably.
For the first month after your symptoms begin, avoid contact sports or activities that put you at risk of falling. This is because you may have a swollen spleen that it’s more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture).
Preventing the spread of infection
There is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever as most people will already be immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
You can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. There’s little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils.
It’s also important to thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered.
Antibiotics and steroids
Antibiotics
are not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses, but they may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of your throat or lungs
(pneumonia)
.
A short course of
corticosteroids
may also be helpful if:
your tonsils are particularly swollen and are causing breathing difficulties
you have severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells)
you have problems affecting your heart, such as pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart)
you have problems affecting your brain or nerves, such as encephalitis
Read more about the
complications of glandular fever
.
Hospital treatment
Most people are able to recover from glandular fever at home, but hospital treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child:
develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties
find swallowing fluids difficult
develop intense abdominal pain
Treatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief.
In a small number of cases, emergency surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) may be needed if it ruptures.
Complications of glandular fever
Most people with glandular fever will recover in 2 or 3 weeks and won’t experience any further problems.
However, complications can develop in a few cases.
Prolonged fatigue
More than 1 in every 10 people with glandular fever will experience prolonged fatigue, which lasts for 6 months or more after the initial infection. It’s not known why fatigue lasts longer in some people.
Some experts think it may be a form of
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
. This is a poorly understood condition that causes persistent fatigue and a range of other symptoms, such as
headaches
and joint pain.
Adopting a gradual exercise plan to rebuild your strength and energy levels may help prevent and reduce prolonged fatigue.
Reduction in blood cells
In a few cases, glandular fever can lead to a reduction in some blood cells. It can reduce levels of:
red blood cells (anaemia) – this can make you feel tired and out of breath
white blood cells (neutropenia) – this can make you more prone to developing a secondary infection
platelets – this can make you bruise and bleed more easily
In most cases, the reduction in the number of blood cells is small and only causes mild symptoms. These problems should get better by themselves within a few weeks or months.
Ruptured spleen
Around half of people who develop glandular fever will have a swollen spleen. This does not present any immediate health problems, but there is a small risk of it rupturing (bursting).
The main sign of a ruptured spleen is sharp pain in the left of the tummy (abdomen).
Go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you develop intense abdominal pain.
The risk of the spleen rupturing is small, occurring in just 1 in every 500 to 1,000 cases of glandular fever, but it can be life threatening because it may cause severe internal bleeding.
In some cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove an enlarged or ruptured spleen (splenectomy).
A ruptured spleen usually occurs as a result of damage caused by vigorous physical activities, such as contact sports.
It’s therefore very important to avoid these activities for at least a month after the symptoms of glandular fever begin.
Be particularly careful during the second and third week of your illness, as this is when the spleen is most vulnerable.
Neurological complications
In less than 1 in every 100 cases, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can affect the nervous system and trigger a range of neurological complications, including:
Guillain-Barré syndrome – where the nerves become inflamed, causing symptoms such as numbness, weakness and temporary paralysis
Bell’s palsy – where the muscles on one side of the face become temporarily weak or paralysed
viral
meningitis
– an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord; although unpleasant, viral meningitis is much less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is life threatening
encephalitis – an infection of the brain
These complications will often need specific treatment, but more than four out of every five people with them will make a full recovery.
Secondary infection
In a small number of cases, the initial infection weakens your immune system and allows bacteria to infect parts of the body. This is called a secondary bacterial infection.
Possible secondary infections that can develop during glandular fever include serious conditions such as
pneumonia
(infection of the lung) and pericarditis (infection of the sac that surrounds the heart).
Secondary infections usually occur in people who have a very weak immune system, such as people with
HIV or AIDS
, or those having
chemotherapy
.
If you have a weakened immune system and you develop glandular fever, as a precaution you may be referred to hospital for specialist treatment. This will allow for your health to be carefully monitored and any secondary infections to be treated."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease/,"Hand, foot and mouth disease
Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common infection that causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet.
It’s most common in young children – particularly those under 10 – but can affect older children and adults as well.
Hand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home.
The infection is not related to foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs.
Symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease
The symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease usually develop between 3 and 5 days after being exposed to the infection.
The first symptoms may include:
a high temperature (fever), usually around 38°C to 39°C (100.4-102.2°F)
a general sense of feeling unwell
loss of appetite
coughing
abdominal (tummy) pain
a
sore throat
and mouth
Mouth ulcers
After 1 or 2 days, red spots appear on the tongue and inside the mouth.
These quickly develop into larger yellow-grey
mouth ulcers
with red edges.
The ulcers can be painful and make eating, drinking and swallowing difficult. They should pass within a week.
Spotty rash and blisters
Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you’ll probably notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin.
These typically develop on the fingers, the backs or palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and occasionally on the buttocks and groin.
The spots may then turn into small
blisters
with a grey centre.
The spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and typically last up to 10 days.
What to do if you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease
If you have hand, foot and mouth disease, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better. There’s no cure for it, so you have to let it run its course.
There are things you can do to help ease your or your child’s symptoms.
Do
drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – water or milk are ideal; it may help to give a baby smaller but more frequent bottle or breast milk feeds
eat soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soups if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable – avoid hot, acidic or spicy foods and drinks
take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to ease a sore throat and fever – aspirin shouldn’t be given to children under the age of 16; paracetamol is best if you’re pregnant
try gargling with warm, salty water to relieve discomfort from mouth ulcers – it’s important not to swallow the mixture, so this isn’t recommended for young children
alternatively, use mouth gels, rinses or sprays for mouth ulcers – these are available from pharmacies, but aren’t routinely recommended, and some aren’t suitable for young children; ask your pharmacist for advice and make sure you read the instructions first
You should keep your child away from nursery or school until they’re feeling better. Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they’re feeling better.
When to get medical advice
You don’t usually need medical attention if you think you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. The infection will usually pass in 7 to 10 days, and there isn’t much your doctor can do.
Antibiotics
won’t help as hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a virus.
If you’re unsure whether you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, you can phone
111
or your GP for advice.
Get medical advice if:
your child is unable or unwilling to drink any fluids
your child has
signs of dehydration
, such as unresponsiveness, passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or cold hands and feet
your child develops fits (seizures), confusion, weakness or a loss of consciousness
your child is under three months old and has a temperature of 38°C (101°F) or above, or is between 3 and 6 months old and has a temperature of 39°C (102°F) or above
the skin becomes very painful, red, swollen and hot, or there’s a discharge of pus
the symptoms are getting worse or haven’t improved after 7 to 10 days
Get advice from your GP if you’re pregnant and you become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about, but there’s a small chance it could make your baby ill if you’re infected shortly before you give birth.
Read more about the
risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy
How hand, foot and mouth disease spreads
Someone with hand, foot and mouth disease is most infectious from just before their symptoms start until they’re feeling better.
The infection can be spread by close person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus is found in:
the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of an infected person – you can become infected if you get these on your hands and then touch your mouth, or if you breathe in the droplets
an infected person’s poo – if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they can contaminate food or surfaces
an infected person’s saliva or fluid from their blisters – you can become infected if this gets in your mouth
The infection is caused by a number of different viruses, so it’s possible to get it more than once. Most people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older.
Preventing hand, foot and mouth disease
It’s not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease, but following this advice can help stop the infection spreading.
Do
stay off work, school or nursery until you or your child are feeling better – there’s usually no need to wait until the last blister has healed, provided you’re otherwise well
use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and put used tissues in a bin as soon as possible
wash your hands with soap and water often – particularly after going to the toilet, coughing, sneezing or handling nappies, and before preparing food
disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated – it’s best to use a bleach-based household cleaner
wash any bedding or clothing that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash
Don’t
do not share cups, utensils, towels and clothes with people who are infected"

About gout
Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling.
It’s estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout.
The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the
menopause
. Overall, gout is more common in men than women.
Gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks.
Signs and symptoms of gout
Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers.
Signs and symptoms of gout include:
severe pain in one or more joints
the joint feeling hot and very tender
swelling in and around the affected joint
red, shiny skin over the affected joint
Symptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. After this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal.
Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year.
Read more about the
symptoms of gout
.
When to see your GP
See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever).
It’s important that a diagnosis is confirmed because other conditions that require urgent treatment, such as an infected joint, can sometimes cause similar symptoms.
If you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you’ve been prescribed (see below) doesn’t start working within a couple of days.
Read more about
diagnosing gout
.
What causes gout?
Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood.
If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don’t filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful.
Things that may increase your chances of getting gout include:
obesity
,
high blood pressure
and/or
diabetes
having a close relative with gout
kidney problems
eating foods that cause a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood
drinking too much beer or spirits
Read more about the
causes of gout
.
Treatments for gout
If you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to:
relieve symptoms during an attack – this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or
corticosteroids
prevent further attacks – through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication that lowers uric acid levels, such as allopurinol
With treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout – and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required.
Read more about
treating gout
.
Can gout cause further problems?
Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it’s left untreated.
These can include:
kidney stones
small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi
permanent joint damage
Read more about the
complications of gout
.
What’s pseudogout?
Pseudogout is a similar condition to gout, but usually affects the knee joint first. It’s a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints – commonly the knee or wrist.
Causes of gout
Gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling.
These crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in the body.
Uric acid
Uric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines.
If your kidneys don’t filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals.
These crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. If they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling).
What can increase your risk?
A high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However, it’s still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don’t.
Other factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below.
Medical conditions
Some underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including:
high blood pressure
diabetes
kidney disease
high levels of fat and cholesterol
in your blood
obesity
metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity)
psoriasis
(a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales)
osteoarthritis
Medication
Certain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. These include:
diuretics (water tablets) – used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body
certain medicines used to treat high blood pressure – including
beta-blockers
and ACE inhibitors
low-dose aspirin
– used to reduce the risk of
blood clots
niacin – used to treat high cholesterol
ciclosporin – used to treat conditions such as psoriasis
some
chemotherapy
medicines
Diet
Uric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. Eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout.
Foods naturally high in purines include:
red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork
seafood – especially shellfish and oily fish
offal – such as liver, kidneys and heart
Alcohol
Alcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood.
Beer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. Moderate consumption of wine – one or two glasses a day – shouldn’t significantly increase your risk of gout.
Sugary drinks
Certain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout.
Some research has found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many fruits) had an increased risk of gout.
Family history
Studies have shown that gout often runs in families. Around one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition.
Symptoms of gout
The main symptom of gout is a sudden attack of severe pain in one or more joints, typically your big toe.
Other symptoms can include:
the joint feeling hot and very tender, to the point of being unable to bear anything touching it
swelling in and around the affected joint
red, shiny skin over the affected joint
peeling, itchy and flaky skin as the swelling goes down
The intense pain can make getting around difficult. Even the light pressure of a bed cover or blanket can be unbearable.
Which joints can be affected?
Gout can affect almost any joint and can occur in more than one joint at the same time.
The joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the:
toes – particularly the big toe joint
midfoot (where your shoelaces sit)
ankles
knees
fingers
wrists
elbows
If gout is left untreated, it’s likely to affect more joints over time.
Pattern of symptoms
Attacks of gout tend to:
occur at night, although they can happen at any time
develop quickly over a few hours
last between three and 10 days – after this time, the affected joint should start to return to normal, but the problem can persist if treatment isn’t started early
come back – you may experience attacks every few months or years
become more frequent over time if not treated
It’s difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed.
Contact your GP immediately or call the
111
service if you have both:
severe, worsening joint pain and swelling
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
This could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis).
If you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you’ve been prescribed doesn’t start working within a couple of days.

Your GP may suspect gout based on your symptoms. Sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.
Seeing your GP
See your GP if you experience
symptoms of gout
for the first time.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis.
They may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood.
Further tests
Many conditions can cause gout-like symptoms.
Your GP may be unable to make a firm diagnosis straight away and you may be referred for further tests. These will either confirm the diagnosis of gout or rule out other conditions.
Joint fluid test
A sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint. The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout, and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis.
Blood test
A
blood test
known as a serum uric acid test may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. A high level or uric acid is often associated with gout.
It’s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. This is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints.
X-ray
An
X-ray
is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn’t usually detectable using this method.
However, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout.
Ultrasound scan
An
ultrasound scan
of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that’s increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals deep in the skin that aren’t obvious during a physical examination.
Treating gout
Treatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks.
Pain relief for a gout attack
What to do during an attack
You should:
take any medication you’ve been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) – this should start to have an effect within two or three days
rest and raise the limb
avoid knocking or damaging the affected joint
keep the joint cool – remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel
ensure you’re well hydrated
Apply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don’t apply ice directly to your skin and don’t apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin.
If necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first.
NSAIDs
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are usually recommended as the first treatment for gout. They work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack.
NSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib.
If you’ve been prescribed NSAIDs, it’s a good idea to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards.
Your GP may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to take alongside your NSAID. This reduces the risk of the NSAID causing
indigestion
,
stomach ulcers
and bleeding from the stomach.
Colchicine
If you’re unable to take NSAIDs or if NSAIDs are ineffective, a medicine called colchicine can be used instead.
Colchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack.
It’s best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. Your GP will tell you how long to take it for and how often.
When taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain and
diarrhoea
.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids
are sometimes used to treat severe cases of gout if other treatments don’t work or you’re unable to take an NSAID or colchicine.
A short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can’t be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including:
weight gain
thinning of the bones (
osteoporosis
)
easy bruising
muscle weakness
Corticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. This can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint.
Medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks
You can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to reduce the level of uric acid in your body.
Medication
Medication to reduce uric acid levels – known as urate-lowering therapy (ULT) – is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you have
complications of gout
.
Most people with gout will eventually need to have ULT, so you may want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment with your doctor as soon as you’ve been diagnosed with gout.
They should explain that while ULT can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there’s a small risk of side effects.
If you decide to start ULT, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. If this isn’t suitable or doesn’t work, other medications may be used instead. These medications are described below.
Allopurinol
Allopurinol helps reduce the production of uric acid. It can help prevent gout attacks, although it won’t help relieve symptoms during an attack.
Allopurinol is a tablet taken once a day. When you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. Regular
blood tests
will be needed to monitor this until the most effective dose is found.
Allopurinol can sometimes cause a gout attack soon after you start taking it and it can take up to a year or two before no further attacks occur. It’s important to persevere with treatment even if you do have attacks during this time.
To help relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first.
Most people taking allopurinol won’t experience any significant side effects. However, side effects can include:
a rash – this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your GP for advice
indigestion
headaches
diarrhoea
Febuxostat
Like allopurinol, febuxostat is a medication taken once a day that reduces the body’s production of uric acid. It’s often used if allopurinol isn’t suitable or causes troublesome side effects.
As with allopurinol, febuxostat can make your symptoms worse when you first start taking it. Your doctor will initially prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described in case you experience attacks.
Side effects of febuxostat can include:
diarrhoea
feeling sick
headaches
a rash
Other medications
Less commonly used ULT medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone.
These types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. They need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist.
Lifestyle changes
Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including:
avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract.
avoiding sugary drinks and snacks – these are associated with an increased risk of gout
maintaining a healthy weight – follow a
balanced diet
; don’t crash diet or try high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets
taking regular exercise – try activities that don’t put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming
drinking plenty of water – keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints
cutting down on alcohol – avoid beer and spirits in particular and don’t binge drink
There’s some evidence to suggest that taking regular
vitamin C
supplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you’re thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren’t suitable or safe for everyone.
Complications of gout
Complications of gout can include small lumps forming under the skin (tophi), joint damage and kidney stones. These are more likely to occur if gout is left untreated.
Tophi
Gout is caused by a chemical called uric acid forming small crystals in and around the joints. These crystals also often build up under the skin and form small white or yellow lumps known as tophi.
Tophi are usually painless, but they can form in awkward places, such as at the ends of your fingers and around your toes. Sometimes they can make everyday tasks such as preparing food or getting dressed difficult.
They can also can become inflamed and produce a toothpaste-like discharge.
Tophi can develop anywhere in the body, but usually form on the:
toes
heels
knees
fingers
ears
forearms
elbows
It normally takes several years after the first attack of gout for tophi to develop, but some people develop them even before experiencing an attack. They’re usually a sign of severe gout and a good reason to start
treatment to reduce the level or uric acid in your body
.
Successful treatment will prevent the tophi from getting any bigger, and long term treatment often gradually shrinks them.
If you have very large or painful tophi, they may have to be surgically removed.
Joint damage
Without treatment, gout attacks may become more frequent and prolonged, and your likelihood of developing permanent joint damage will increase.
In the most serious cases, surgery may be required to repair or replace a damaged joint.
Kidney stones
Occasionally, high levels of uric acid can lead to the formation of
kidney stones
.
Some kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pass urine, and can make you feel that you need to pass urine more often.
You may be prescribed medication to make your urine less acidic, which should help dissolve any kidney stones that have developed. Read more about
treating kidney stones
.
Psychological and emotional effects
Gout can also affect your mood, work and home life. The severe pain that gout causes can make it difficult to do everyday tasks and to get around, which in turn can lead to feelings of
depression
or
anxiety
.
If gout is affecting your mood or making everyday life difficult, talk to your GP. They will be able to offer treatment and support.
There are also a number of organisations that offer information and advice for people who have gout, including

About gum disease
If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always
phone the dental practice that you normally attend
.
If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should
read our advice on dental emergencies
.
Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected.
Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It’s much less common in children.
If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.
If gingivitis isn’t treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place.
If periodontitis isn’t treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.
Read more about the
symptoms of gum disease
.
What causes gum disease?
Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria.
Some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don’t remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness.
Read more about the causes of gum disease.
Seeing your dentist
You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth.
Find a dentist near you
.
Your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth.
In some cases, a number of
X-rays
may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone.
Preventing and treating gum disease
Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups.
In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They’ll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future.
If you have severe gum disease, you’ll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics).
Read more about
treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean
.
Dental check-ups
It’s important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early.
If you’ve never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every 1 to 2 years for a check-up.
You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you’ve had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment.
If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems – for example, if you smoke or have
diabetes
– you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored.
Complications of gum disease
If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as:
gum abscesses
(painful collections of pus)
receding gums
loose teeth
loss of teeth
Read more about the
complications of gum disease
.
Symptoms of gum disease
Healthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn’t bleed when you touch or brush them.
Gum disease isn’t always painful and you may be unaware you have it. It’s important to have regular
dental check-ups
.
Early symptoms
The initial symptoms of gum disease can include:
red and swollen gums
bleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeth
This stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.
Advanced symptoms
If gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as periodontitis, or periodontal disease.
Symptoms of periodontitis can include:
bad breath (halitosis)
an unpleasant taste in your mouth
loose teeth that can make eating difficult
gum abscesses
(collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth)
Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
In rare cases, a condition called acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) can develop suddenly. The symptoms of ANUG are usually more severe than those of gum disease and can include:
bleeding, painful gums
painful ulcers
receding gums inbetween your teeth
bad breath
a metallic taste in your mouth
excess saliva in your mouth
difficulty swallowing or talking
a high temperature (fever)
When to see a dentist
You should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or ANUG.
If you don’t currently have a dentist,
search for a dentist near you

Causes of gum disease
Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors, but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause.
Poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly, can cause plaque to build up on your teeth.
Plaque
Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque, which builds up on your teeth.
When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods), bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need, producing acid at the same time.
Over time, acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth’s surface and causes tooth decay.
Other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums, making them inflamed and sore.
Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth, but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it’s not removed. Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist.
Who is most at risk?
As well as poor oral hygiene, a number of things can increase your risk of developing problems with your gums. These include:
smoking
your age – gum disease becomes more common as you get older
a family history of gum disease
diabetes
– a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar levels to become too high
a weakened immune system – for example, because of conditions such as
HIV and AIDS
or certain treatments, such as
chemotherapy
malnutrition
– a condition that occurs when a person’s diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients
stress
Treating gum disease
The best way to treat gum disease is to practise good oral hygiene, although additional dental and medical treatments are sometimes necessary.
Oral hygiene
Good oral hygiene involves:
brushing your teeth for about 2 minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion everyday – it doesn’t matter if you use an electric or manual toothbrush but some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush
using toothpaste that contains the right amount of
fluoride
(a natural mineral that helps protect against
tooth decay
)
flossing
your teeth regularly – preferably daily, before brushing your teeth
not smoking
regularly visiting your dentist – at least once every 1 to 2 years, but more frequently if necessary
See the
teeth cleaning guide
for more information and advice about how to keep your teeth clean.
Mouthwash
Antiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are available over the counter from pharmacies. However, there’s some debate about whether using mouthwash is necessary for people with healthy gums.
Your dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). Your dentist will be able to advise you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it.
Chlorhexidine mouthwash can stain your teeth brown if you use it regularly. Rinse your mouth thoroughly between brushing your teeth and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash because some ingredients in toothpaste can prevent the mouthwash working.
Dental treatments
Some of the dental treatments described below may also be recommended if you have gum disease.
Scale and polish
To remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth, your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. This is a ‘professional clean’ usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist.
The dental hygienist will scrape away plaque and tartar from your teeth using special instruments, then polish your teeth to remove marks or stains. If a lot of plaque or tartar has built up, you may need to have more than one scale and polish.
The price of a scale and polish can vary depending on what needs to be carried out, so ask your dental hygienist how much it will cost beforehand.
Root planing
In some cases of gum disease, root planing (debridement) may be required. This is a deep clean under the gums that gets rid of bacteria from the roots of your teeth.
Before having the treatment, you may need to have a
local anaesthetic
(painkilling medication) to numb the area. You may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing.
Further treatment
If you have severe gum disease, you may need further treatment, such as periodontal surgery. In some cases, it’s necessary to remove the affected tooth. Your dentist will be able to tell you about the procedure needed and how it’s carried out. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist.
If you’re having surgery or root planing, you may be given antibiotics (medication to treat infections). Your dentist will tell you whether this is necessary.
Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) should always be treated by a dentist. However, if you see your GP before visiting a dentist, they may provide you with some treatment while you wait to see your dentist.
As well as oral hygiene advice and dental treatments, treatments for ANUG may also include antibiotics, painkillers and different types of mouthwash.
Antibiotics
Treatment with
antibiotics
, such as metronidazole or amoxicillin, may be recommended if you have ANUG. You’ll usually have to take these for 3 days.
Amoxicillin isn’t suitable for people allergic to penicillin. Metronidazole can react with alcohol, causing you to feel very unwell. You shouldn’t drink alcohol while you’re taking metronidazole and for 48 hours after you finish the course of treatment.
Other side effects of metronidazole and amoxicillin can include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting and
diarrhoea
.
Painkillers
Paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
are the most commonly prescribed painkillers. They’re also available over the counter from pharmacies. They may help reduce pain and discomfort.
However, paracetamol and ibuprofen aren’t suitable for everyone, so read the manufacturer’s instructions before taking them.
Mouthwash
Mouthwash containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide may be prescribed to treat ANUG. Some chlorhexidine mouthwashes are also available over the counter, though they may not be as effective as a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash.
You should always read the instructions before using mouthwash. Some types may need to be diluted in water before they’re taken.
Complications of gum disease
If you develop gingivitis and don’t have the plaque or tartar (hardened plaque) removed from your teeth, the condition may get worse and lead to periodontitis.
You may develop further complications if you don’t treat periodontitis (where the tissue that supports teeth is affected), including:
recurrent
gum abscesses
(painful collections of pus)
increasing damage to the periodontal ligament (the tissue that connects the tooth to the socket)
increasing damage to and loss of the alveolar bone (the bone in the jaw that contains the sockets of the teeth)
receding gums
loose teeth
loss of teeth
Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
If you have acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) and it’s not treated, it can cause more severe complications.
The infection can spread to all areas of your gums and the alveolar bone surrounding your teeth. This can lead to:
the gums between your teeth being completely destroyed
large ulcers (open sores) leaving permanent holes in your gums
loose and unstable teeth
If ANUG isn’t properly treated the first time you have it, you’re more likely to have recurring cases in the future. This can cause persistent bad breath (halitosis) and bleeding gums, as well as gradually receding gums.
In rare cases, ANUG can lead to gangrene affecting the lips and cheeks. This occurs when tissue starts to die and waste away. If you develop gangrene, you may need to have the dead tissue removed.
Other complications
Gum disease has also been associated with an increased risk for a number of other health conditions, including:
cardiovascular disease
lung infections
if affected during pregnancy,
premature labour
and having a baby with a low birth weight
However, while people with gum disease may have an increased risk of these problems, there isn’t currently any clear evidence that gum disease directly causes them."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/heart-failure/,"Heart failure
Heart failure is a condition where your heart cannot pump blood around your body as well as it should. It does not mean that your heart has stopped working completely, but you may need support to help it to work better and to manage your symptoms.
Symptoms of heart failure
When the heart is not pumping blood as well as it should, you can experience a range of symptoms.
Speak to a GP if you have:
breathlessness
a persistent cough
tiredness or fatigue that occurs even at rest and gets worse with movement
swelling in the legs or ankles
Causes of heart failure
There are many reasons why someone might develop heart failure. These can include:
a heart attack
coronary heart disease
inherited heart disease
(for example, cardiomyopathy)
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
heart rhythm or valve abnormalities
viral infection
damage from the immune system (myocarditis)
congenital heart disease
amyloidosis
Diagnosing heart failure
Your doctor will ask you some questions about your symptoms and do an examination. If they think that you might have heart failure, you’ll be sent for some further tests.
Tests to confirm a diagnosis of heart failure may include:
blood tests
to check for signs of a problem with your heart – this may include testing your BNP levels, which increase when the heart is not working well
a chest
X-ray
– to check if there’s fluid in your lungs or if a lung condition is causing the symptoms
an electrocardiogram (ECG)
– records the electrical activity and rhythms of your heart
an echocardiogram
– checks the pumping action of your heart and the function of the valves in your heart
Treating heart failure
If you have heart failure, treatments are available to help you manage your symptoms. This can help to improve your quality of life.
Your doctor will discuss treatment options with you. The best option for you will depend on your individual circumstances.
The standard medicines for treating heart failure are:
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
beta blockers
diuretics (water tablets)
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)
For some people with severe heart failure, a heart transplant may be recommended. Your doctor will discuss whether this is an appropriate option for you.
Managing heart failure
Do
keep as active as possible
keep a healthy weight
eat a healthy diet
limit alcohol intake
stop smoking
Support
Living with heart failure can bring a lot of uncertainty. Some people might find this difficult.
You can get support in dealing with heart failure from:
a local support group – ask your GP for advice or search

When to see your GP
See your GP if you’re having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty. If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears, you must see your GP as soon as possible.
Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon for further tests.
You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an
online hearing test.

Why it happens
Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies:
sensorineural hearing loss – caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve; this occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury
conductive hearing loss – when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as
earwax
, glue ear or a build-up of fluid from an
ear infection
, or because of a perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones
It’s also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss.
Some people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older.
Read more about
causes of hearing loss
Preventing hearing loss
It isn’t always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing.
However, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home and using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments.
You should also see your GP if you have signs of an ear infection, such as
flu
-like symptoms, severe
earache
, discharge or hearing loss.
Read more about
preventing hearing loss
Treating hearing loss
The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is.
In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person’s ability to hear and communicate. These include:
digital hearing aids – which are available through the NHS
bone anchored implants – suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss
middle ear implants – suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids
cochlear implants – for people who find hearing aids aren’t powerful enough
lip reading and/or sign language – such as British Sign Language (BSL)
Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don’t work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs).

Signs of hearing loss
Hearing loss is sometimes sudden, but often it’s gradual and you may not notice it at first. Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly.
It’s important to spot hearing loss as soon as possible, because treatment is often more beneficial if started early.
General signs of hearing loss
Early signs of hearing loss can include:
difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations
asking people to repeat themselves
listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need
difficulty hearing the telephone or doorbell
finding it difficult to tell which direction noise is coming from
regularly feeling tired or stressed, from having to concentrate while listening
In some cases, you may recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they notice it themselves. Research suggests it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it.
If you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of
tinnitus
, which is often associated with hearing loss.

Signs of hearing loss in children
Babies are routinely screened within the first few weeks of their birth as part of the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP). However, there are signs you can look out for which may suggest you should see your GP to arrange another hearing test.
Signs in babies
You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your baby or toddler:
isn’t startled by loud noises
doesn’t turn towards the source of a sound while under four months old
doesn’t say single words by the time they’re one year old
notices you when they see you, but not when you call their name
hears some sounds but not others
Signs in children
You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your child:
is slow to learn to talk, or they’re not clear when they speak
often asks you to repeat yourself or responds inappropriately to a question
doesn’t reply when you call them
often talks very loudly
often turns up the volume of the TV so it’s very loud
watches other people to copy instructions, because they haven’t heard
Seeking medical help
Make an appointment to see your GP if you’re having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulties.
If you wake up with a sudden loss of hearing in one ear or lose the hearing in one ear within a couple of days, you should see your GP as soon as possible.

These causes are explained below.
Age
Age is the biggest single cause of hearing loss. Hearing loss that develops as a result of getting older is often known as age-related hearing loss or presbycusis.
Most people begin to lose a small amount of their hearing from around 40 years of age. This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems.
As your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or children’s voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as “s”, “f” and “th”. This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult.
Loud noises
Another common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged.
You’re at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you:
work with noisy equipment, such as pneumatic drills or compressed-air hammers
work in environments where there’s loud music, such as a nightclub
regularly listen to music at a high volume through headphones
Hearing loss can also occur suddenly after exposure to an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma.
See
preventing hearing loss
for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss.
Other types of sensorineural hearing loss
Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged.
Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss.
Sensorineural hearing loss can also be caused by:
the genes you inherit – some people may be born deaf or become deaf over time because of a genetic abnormality
viral infections of the inner ear – such as
mumps
or
measles
viral infections of the auditory nerve – such as mumps or rubella
acoustic neuroma – a non-cancerous (benign) growth on or near the auditory nerve
meningitis
– an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord
encephalitis – inflammation of the brain
multiple sclerosis
– a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
a head injury
an autoimmune condition
malformation of the ear
stroke
– where the blood supply to the brain is cut off or interrupted
Some treatments and medicines, such as
radiotherapy
for nasal and sinus cancer, certain
chemotherapy
medicines or certain
antibiotics
can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss.
People with
diabetes
,
chronic kidney disease
and
cardiovascular disease
are also at increased risk of hearing loss.
Sensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases.
Causes of conductive hearing loss
Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear (glue ear), or an
ear infection
.
Conductive hearing loss can also be caused by:
a perforated eardrum – where the eardrum is torn or has a hole in it
otosclerosis – an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear that causes the inner hearing bone (the stapes) to be less mobile and less effective at transmitting sound
damage to the hearing bones from injury, a collapsed ear drum or conditions such as cholesteatoma
swelling around the eustachian tube – caused by jaw surgery or radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer
malformation of the ear
Eustachian tube dysfunction
something becoming trapped in the ear (a foreign body)
Conductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery.

Diagnosing hearing loss
See your GP if you’re having problems with your hearing. They’ll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests.
You may also want to visit the
Action on Hearing Loss
website for an
online hearing test
.
Ear examination
During an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including:
a blockage caused by
earwax
, fluid or an object
an ear canal infection
a bulging ear drum – indicating an
infection inside the middle ear
fluid behind the ear drum – known as
glue ear
a perforated ear drum
a collapsed ear drum
skin collected in the middle ear (cholesteatoma)
Your GP will ask if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss.
Referral to a specialist
Your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiologist (a hearing specialist). The specialist will carry out further hearing tests to help determine what’s causing your hearing loss and recommend the best course of treatment.
Some of the hearing tests you may have include a:
tuning fork test (sometimes performed by your GP)
pure tone audiometry
bone conduction test
These tests are described below.
Tuning fork test
A tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it’s gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing.
The tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head.
This test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn’t working properly.
Pure tone audiometry
Pure tone audiometry tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button.
Bone conduction test
A bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It’s used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working.
Bone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard.
Bone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both.

Newborn hearing screening
All newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme.
The tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need.

the newborn hearing test
Levels of hearing loss
Very few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you’re able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below.
Mild deafness
If you’re mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations.
Moderate deafness
If you’re moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example.
Severe deafness
If you’re severely deaf, the quietest sound you’re able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid.
Profound deafness
If you’re profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English.

Treating hearing loss
How hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition.
Hearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable.
For example,
earwax build-up
can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with
antibiotics
. Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair a perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones.
However, hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or to the nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent.
If your hearing is impaired, treatment can improve your hearing and quality of life. Some of these treatments are discussed below.
Hearing aids
If you have hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid. About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them.
A hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you can hear things more clearly.
The microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation.
Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear.
Hearing aids help improve hearing, but don’t give you your hearing back. They’re suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you.
If a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You’ll also be shown how to use and care for it.
After your hearing aid has been fitted, you should have a follow-up appointment within 12 weeks.
If you experience problems using a hearing aid – such as distortion and repeated infections – that can’t be corrected by an audiologist, you may benefit from different treatments. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon can discuss these with you. An ENT surgeon with a special interest in ear surgery is called an otologist.
NHS hearing aids
The NHS loans hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you’ll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment.
In the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital.
Instead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop.
The type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid may be issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it’s not available on the NHS.
Types of hearing aids
The different types of hearing aids are described below.
Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids
BTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear.
Some types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments.
Open fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould.
Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids
Receiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal.
This means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices.
In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids
In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal.
The working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell.
In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids
In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible.
Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids
Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids.
However, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections.
Body-worn (BW) hearing aids
Body-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear.
This type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid.
CROS/BiCROS
CROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn’t have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that’s able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available.
BiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that’s able to hear. They’re useful for people who don’t have any hearing in one ear, with some hearing loss in the other ear.
Bone conduction hearing aids
Bone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can’t wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone.
They can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear.
The part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods.
Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA)
A Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower.
Unlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it’s not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears.
Some people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre.
Middle ear implants
These are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate.
They’re suitable for people who can’t use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help.
Disposable hearing aids
Disposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss.
The battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids tend to be expensive in the long term and are only available privately.
Cochlear implants
Cochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind your ear during surgery.
They have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array).
The external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally.
A cochlear implant is sometimes recommended for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, which isn’t helped by hearing aids.
Both ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only able to have one implant on the NHS.
Before a cochlear implant is recommended, you’ll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren’t suitable.
If a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears) during an operation and switched on a few weeks later.
There are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year.
Safety
According to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven’t been immunised against pneumococcal disease.
In August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection.
Although the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it’s slightly higher than for the general population.
Auditory brainstem implants
In some cases of severe to profound hearing loss, where there are problems with the nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used.
An ABI is an electrical device made up of:
electrodes implanted into the part of the brain responsible for processing sound (in the brainstem)
a receiver device placed under the skin behind your ear
a small sound processor outside your ear
When the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes.
An ABI will not fully restore your hearing, but it can usually restore some degree of hearing and can make lip-reading easier. It’s often used as a treatment for hearing loss associated with a condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).
Lip reading and sign language
Hearing loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English.
For people who experience hearing loss after they’ve learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a person’s mouth movements while they’re speaking, to understand what they’re saying.
For people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn
sign language
, such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning.
BSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech.
The
Action on Hearing Loss
website has more information on
British Sign Language (BSL)
and
lip-reading
.
Preventing hearing loss
The ears are fragile structures that can be damaged in many ways, so it’s not always possible to prevent hearing loss.
The risk of your hearing being damaged by loud noises depends on how loud the noises are and how long you’re exposed to them. Experts agree that continued exposure to noise at or above 85dB (similar to a lawn mower or loud traffic) can, over time, cause hearing loss.
However, by following the advice below it’s possible to reduce your risk of noise-induced hearing loss (hearing loss from loud noise):
Don’t have your television, radio or music on too loud. This is particularly important if you have young children in the house, because their ears are more delicate than an adult’s. If you can’t have a comfortable conversation with someone who is two metres (about 6.5ft) away from you, turn the volume down. You shouldn’t have dull hearing or ringing in your ears after listening to music.
Use headphones that block out more outside noise, rather than turning up the volume. You can buy add-ons for your existing headphones that block out more outside noise, or noise cancelling headphones.
Use ear protection equipment such as ear muffs or ear plugs if you work in a noisy environment, such as a pub, nightclub, a garage workshop or on a building site. It’s important to insert ear plugs correctly to gain the benefit of wearing them.
Use ear-protection equipment at loud concerts and at other events where there are high noise levels, such as motor races.
Don’t insert objects into your ears or your children’s ears. This includes fingers, cotton buds, cotton wool and tissue.
Be aware of the symptoms of common causes of hearing loss, such as
ear infections (otitis media)
and Ménière’s disease
Visit your GP if you or your child are experiencing hearing problems.

About haemorrhoids
Haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus).
In many cases, haemorrhoids don’t cause symptoms, and some people don’t even realise they have them. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:
bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red)
itchy bottom
a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool
a mucus discharge after passing a stool
soreness, redness and swelling around your anus
Haemorrhoids aren’t usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes.
The symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription. However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don’t get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.
Your GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.
Some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there’s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.
Read more about
diagnosing haemorrhoids
.
What causes haemorrhoids?
The exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but they’re associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.
Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged
constipation
– this is often due to a lack of fibre in a person’s diet. Chronic (long-term)
diarrhoea
can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.
Other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:
being overweight or
obese
age – as you get older, your body’s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids
being pregnant – which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about
common pregnancy problems
)
having a family history of haemorrhoids
regularly lifting heavy objects
a persistent
cough
or repeated vomiting
sitting down for long periods of time
Preventing and treating haemorrhoids
Haemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.
However, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:
gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats
drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water, but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and
alcohol
not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet
avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine
losing weight
(if you’re overweight)
exercising regularly
– can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight
These measures can also reduce the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing in the first place.
Medication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.
There are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off after about a week.
Surgery carried out under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re unconscious) is sometimes used to remove or shrink large or external haemorrhoids.
Read more about
treating haemorrhoids
and
surgery for haemorrhoids
.
Diagnosing haemorrhoids
Your GP can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels.
Some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there’s no need to be embarrassed – all GPs are used to diagnosing and treating piles.
It’s important to tell your GP about all of your symptoms – for example, tell them if you’ve recently lost a lot of weight, if your bowel movements have changed, or if your stools have become dark or sticky.
Rectal examination
Your GP may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a digital rectal examination (DRE).
During a DRE, your GP will wear gloves and use lubricant. Using their finger, they’ll feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. A DRE shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort.
Proctoscopy
In some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. A proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that’s inserted into your anus.
This allows your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine).
GPs are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. However, not all GPs have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to go to a hospital clinic to have the procedure.
Types of haemorrhoids
After you’ve had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to determine what type of haemorrhoids you have.
Haemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. Internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). The nerves in the lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves in the upper part can’t.
Haemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. They can be:
first degree – small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren’t visible from outside the anus
second degree – larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again
third degree – one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside (prolapsing and reducible)
fourth degree – larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can’t be pushed back inside (irreducible)
It’s useful for doctors to know what type and size of haemorrhoid you have, as they can then decide on the best treatment.
Read more about
treating haemorrhoids
.
Treating haemorrhoids
Haemorrhoids (piles) often clear up by themselves after a few days. However, there are many treatments that can reduce itching and discomfort.
Making simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first.
Creams, ointments and suppositories (which you insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort.
If more intensive treatment is needed, the type will depend on where your haemorrhoids are in your anal canal – the lower third (closest to your anus) or the upper two-thirds. The lower third contain nerves which can transmit pain, while the upper two-thirds do not.
Non-surgical treatments for haemorrhoids in the lower part of the canal are likely to be very painful, because the nerves in this area can detect pain. In these cases,
haemorrhoid surgery
will usually be recommended.
The various treatments for haemorrhoids are outlined below.
Dietary changes and self care
If
constipation
is thought to be the cause of your haemorrhoids, you need to keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don’t strain when passing stools.
You can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables.
You should also drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola).
When going to the toilet, you should:
avoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse
use moist toilet paper, rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes to clean your bottom after passing a stool
pat the area around your bottom, rather than rubbing it
Read more about
preventing constipation
.
Medication
Over-the-counter topical treatments
Various creams, ointments and suppositories (which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort.
These medicines should only be used for five to seven days at a time. If you use them for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus. Any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above.
There’s no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it.
Don’t use more than one product at once.
Corticosteroid cream
If you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your GP may prescribe
corticosteroid cream
, which contains steroids.
You shouldn’t use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse.
Painkillers
Common painkilling medication, such as
paracetamol
, can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids.
However, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as
ibuprofen
, because it can make rectal bleeding worse. You should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation.
Your GP may prescribe products that contain
local anaesthetic
to treat painful haemorrhoids. Like over-the-counter topical treatments, these should only be used for a few days, because they can make the skin around your back passage more sensitive.
Laxatives
If you’re constipated, your GP may prescribe a
laxative
. Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels.
Non-surgical treatments
If dietary changes and medication don’t improve your symptoms, your GP may refer you to a specialist. They can confirm whether you have haemorrhoids and recommend appropriate treatment.
If you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended.
Banding
Banding involves placing a very tight elastic band around the base of your haemorrhoids to cut off their blood supply. The haemorrhoids should then fall off within about a week of having the treatment.
Banding is usually a day procedure that doesn’t need an anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. You may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. Normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your GP can prescribe something stronger, if needed.
You may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. If you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off.
Directly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet. This is normal, but there shouldn’t be a lot of bleeding. If you pass a lot of bright red blood or blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately.
Ulcers (open sores) can occur at the site of the banding, although these usually heal without needing further treatment.
Injections (sclerotherapy)
A treatment called sclerotherapy may be used as an alternative to banding.
During sclerotherapy, a chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. This relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. It also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. After about 4 to 6 weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up.
After the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day. You may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. You should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure.
Electrotherapy
Electrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another alternative to banding for people with smaller haemorrhoids.
During the procedure, a device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate the haemorrhoid. An electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that’s placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. The specialist can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe.
The aim of electrotherapy is to cause the blood supplying the haemorrhoid to coagulate (thicken), which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink. If necessary, more than one haemorrhoid can be treated during each session.
Electrotherapy can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under a
general anaesthetic
or spinal anaesthetic.
You may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn’t last long. Rectal bleeding is another possible side effect of the procedure, but this is usually short-lived.
Electrotherapy is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and has been shown to be an effective method of treating smaller haemorrhoids. It can also be used as an alternative to surgery for treating larger haemorrhoids, but there’s less evidence of its effectiveness.
Surgery
Although most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery.
Surgery is particularly useful for haemorrhoids that have developed below the dentate line because, unlike non-surgical treatments, anaesthetic is used to ensure you don’t feel any pain.
There are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink.

Surgery for haemorrhoids
Surgery may be recommended if other treatments for haemorrhoids (piles) haven’t worked, or if you have haemorrhoids that aren’t suitable for non-surgical treatment.
There are many different surgical procedures for piles.
Haemorrhoidectomy
A haemorrhoidectomy is an operation to remove haemorrhoids. It’s usually carried out under
general anaesthetic
, which means you’ll be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out.
A conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. You’ll need to take a week or so off work to recover.
You’ll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. You may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. Seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer.
After having a haemorrhoidectomy, there’s around a 1 in 20 chance of the haemorrhoids returning, which is lower than with non-surgical treatments. Adopting or continuing a high-fibre diet after surgery is recommended to reduce this risk.
Haemorrhoidal artery ligation
Haemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids.
It’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a small
ultrasound
probe into your anus. The probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid.
Each blood vessel is stitched closed to block the blood supply to the haemorrhoid, which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink over the following days and weeks. The stitches can also be used to reduce prolapsing haemorrhoids (haemorrhoids that hang down from the anus).
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends haemorrhoidal artery ligation as a safe and effective alternative to a haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (see below). It causes less pain and, in terms of results, a high level of satisfaction has been reported.
The recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker compared with other surgical procedures. There’s a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks.
Stapling
Stapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. It’s sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic.
The procedure isn’t carried out as often as it used to be, because it has a slightly higher risk of serious complications than the alternative treatments available.
During the operation, part of the anorectum (the last section of the large intestine), is stapled. This means the haemorrhoids are less likely to prolapse and it reduces the supply of blood to the haemorrhoids, which causes them to gradually shrink.
Stapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. It also tends to be a less painful procedure.
However, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. There have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum).
Other treatments
Other treatment options are available, including freezing and laser treatment. However, the number of NHS or private surgeons who perform these treatments is limited.
General risks of haemorrhoid surgery
Although the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. These can include:
bleeding or passing blood clots, which may happen a week or so after the operation
infection, which may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess) – you may be given a short course of
antibiotics
after surgery to reduce this risk
urinary retention (difficulty emptying your bladder)
faecal incontinence
(the involuntarily passing of stools)
anal fistula (a small channel that develops between the anal canal and surface of the skin, near the anus)
stenosis (narrowing of the anal canal) – this risk is highest if you have treatment on haemorrhoids that have developed in a ring around the lining of the anal canal
These problems can often be treated with medication or more surgery. Ask your surgeon to explain the risks in more detail before deciding to have surgery.
When to seek medical advice
Seek medical advice from the hospital unit where the surgery was carried out, or from your GP, if you experience:
excessive bleeding
a high temperature (fever)
problems urinating
worsening pain or swelling around your anus
If you’re unable to contact the hospital or your GP, phone
NHS 24’s 111 service
for advice or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/heart-attack/,"Heart attack
Phone 999 immediately if:
You or someone else has symptoms like:
central chest pain or discomfort in the chest that doesn’t go away – it may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing
pain that radiates down the left arm, or both arms, or to the neck, jaw, back or stomach
unconsciousness
seizures or fitting
difficulty breathing (snoring or rasping)
rapid heart beat
low or undetectable heart beat
chest pain and breathlessness, nausea, sweating or coughing up blood
What is a heart attack?
A heart attack happens when there’s a reduction in blood supply to part of the heart muscle. This lack of blood flow can cause damage to the heart.
Sometimes, when
chest pain
occurs suddenly, it’s unclear if it’s due to unstable
angina
or a heart attack. Until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).
Further information on causes and risk factors for a heart attack.
Diagnosing a heart attack
In order to find out if you’re having a heart attack, you’ll need to have some tests. These tests can include:
an electrocardiogram (ECG) – to check your heart’s rhythm and electrical activity
blood tests
– to check troponin levels, a protein that’s released into the blood stream when the heart muscle is damaged
an assessment of blood pressure
an assessment of blood oxygen levels
a chest
X-ray
an echocardiogram
– to assess the structure and function of your heart
a coronary angiogram
– to identify any blood vessels that are narrowed or blocked
Based on your test results, your clinical team will decide your treatment plan.
Treating a heart attack
When someone has a heart attack, it’s important to restore blood flow quickly. This’ll minimise damage to the heart muscle and start to alleviate symptoms.
Your treatment plan will depend on:
the type of heart attack you’ve had
your individual situation
Types of treatment
Treatment for a heart attack may consist of:
anti-emetics – to stop sickness and nausea
antiplatelet therapy
– medication that thins the blood and gets rid of blood clots
coronary angioplasty – a procedure to widen coronary arteries that are blocked or narrow
oxygen therapy – to help with your breathing and oxygen levels
pain-relieving drugs – like morphine
reperfusion treatment – to help restore blood flow and maintain the heart’s pumping action
thrombolysis – a ‘clot-busting drug’ to help restore blood flow to your heart
People who’ve had a heart attack will need to take several different types of medication. Your doctor will try to find the best drugs for you with the fewest side effects.
Complications of a heart attack
Sometimes there are complications following a heart attack. The most common complications after a heart attack are:
arrhythmias – problems with your heart’s natural electrical rhythm
heart failure
– when the heart isn’t pumping blood around the body as well as it should
Many problems resolve themselves quite quickly. However, sometimes problems linger and can often be helped by medication.
Recovering from a heart attack
How long you stay in hospital will depend upon your circumstances and treatment. Don’t be afraid to ask your medical team about what’s happening.
On discharge, you should be referred onto a cardiac rehabilitation programme.
Cardiac rehabilitation
You should receive an assessment to determine your individual goals and needs after a heart attack.
Rehabilitation is usually a mix of exercise and education sessions. This helps to provide you with the information, advice and support to:
understand your condition and medication
recover from your heart attack, procedure or surgery
make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health
Your cardiac rehabilitation team can also give you advice on practical issues after a heart attack, including:
driving
mental wellbeing
relationships
sexual relationships
returning to work
long term recovery
The British Heart Foundation has further information on cardiac rehabilitation."

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by bacteria.
Infection usually occurs in the genitals but can affect the throat, eyes and anus.
Symptoms of gonorrhoea
Many people with gonorrhoea won’t notice any symptoms.
If you do get symptoms, it’s usually between 1 to 14 days after getting the infection.
Symptoms of gonorrhoea may include:
green or yellow fluid coming out of the penis
pain or a burning sensation when peeing
discomfort and swelling of the testicles
increased discharge from the vagina
pain in the lower tummy, particularly during sex
bleeding in between periods or after sex
Gonorrhoea can also infect the throat, eyes or anus. You may experience pain or discharge in these areas. Gonorrhoea in the throat usually has no symptoms.
Having the infection during pregnancy can result in giving birth to the baby early (premature birth). Gonorrhoea can be passed on to the baby during birth and can result in eye infections in the infant.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice or midwife if:
you’re pregnant and think you have gonorrhoea
Testing for gonorrhoea
If you think you might have gonorrhoea, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
(if you have symptoms)
contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)
ordering a home test kit
(if you do not have symptoms)
Services available may vary depending on where you live.
What does a gonorrhoea test involve?
The test for gonorrhoea is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.
You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:
using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed
People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.
Some sexual health clinics may be able to carry out rapid tests and give you your test results straight away. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait up to 2 weeks to get the results.
If you have gonorrhoea, your partner will be offered testing and treatment.
Treatment for gonorrhoea
Antibiotics will treat the gonorrhoea infection. These can be given in pill form or as an injection.
Some strains of gonorrhoea are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This can make it more difficult to treat. You may be tested again 3 weeks later to check the antibiotics have worked.
If there’s a high chance you have gonorrhoea, you may be given treatment before you get your results back.
You may also be offered treatment if your partner (s) is found to have gonorrhoea.
Tell the doctor or nurse if you:
are pregnant
think you might be pregnant
are breastfeeding
This may make a difference to the antibiotic you’re prescribed.
If your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
If gonorrhoea is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
. This is a major cause of
ectopic pregnancy
and infertility in women.
If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.
Do not have sex until you and your partner have both finished the treatment. You should also wait until you’ve had the results of the 2 week test to prevent being infected again.
How gonorrhoea is passed on
Gonorrhoea is passed through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom).
It can also be passed on by:
sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye
it can also be passed to a newborn during childbirth
Reducing the risk of gonorrhoea
The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with gonorrhoea you should get tested for all STIs including:
syphilis
HIV
chlamydia

Hepatitis B is a liver infection that’s spread through blood and body fluids. The chance of getting it in the UK is low.
It often doesn’t cause any symptoms in adults and usually passes in a few months without treatment. In children it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage.
A hepatitis B vaccine is available on the NHS as part of
routine child vaccination
, or if you’re at high risk.
Symptoms of hepatitis B
Many people with hepatitis B won’t have any symptoms.
If you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis B include:
tiredness
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
general aches and pains
loss of appetite
feeling and being sick
diarrhoea
abdominal pain
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus – emergency treatment can help prevent infection if given within a few days of exposure
you have symptoms of hepatitis B
you’re at high risk of hepatitis B
Diagnosing hepatitis B
A
blood test
can check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past. The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection.
Treatments for hepatitis B
Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you’ve been infected for.
Emergency treatment
If you’ve been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected.
Treatment for acute hepatitis B
Acute hepatitis B means you’ve only had the infection for a few weeks or months. You may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection itself.
Treatment for chronic hepatitis B
Chronic hepatitis B means you’ve had the infection for more than 6 months. You may be offered medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage.
Chronic hepatitis B often requires:
long-term or lifelong treatment
regular checks for any further liver problems
How is hepatitis B spread?
The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood, semen and vaginal fluids and bodily fluids of an infected person.
It can be spread by:
a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common
within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common
injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters
having sex with an infected person without using a condom
having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment
sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood
Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils.
How to prevent hepatitis B
A
vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B
is available for all babies born in the UK on or after 1 August 2017. It’s also available for people at high risk of the infection or complications from it.
People at high risk of hepatitis B
People at high risk of hepatitis B include:
babies born to mothers with hepatitis B
close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B
people travelling to a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread
families adopting or fostering children from high-risk countries
people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs
people who change their sexual partner often
men who have sex with men
male and female sex workers
people whose job puts them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff
people with
chronic liver disease
people with
chronic kidney disease
people in prison
people receiving regular blood or blood products, and their carers
Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) testing and lookback programme
NHS Scotland is making the blood supply safer by introducing enhanced hepatitis B screening. This is an additional measure to improve testing for blood donors and further increase the safety of the blood supply chain.
NHS Scotland has been conducting this enhanced screening on all donations since April 2022. Only a small number of donors are impacted, however, these donors will no longer be able to donate.
Lookback programme
NHS Scotland is also undertaking a lookback programme. Anyone who has received blood from a donor found to be positive for anti-HBc by this new test (anti-HBc) will be contacted by letter. If you’re affected, you’ll be offered testing, support and advice.
Lookback programmes are happening across the UK.
Further information about the programme is available
Living with hepatitis B
As well as medical treatments, there are some things you can do when you have hepatitis B to help ease the symptoms and stop the infection spreading to others.
Do
eat a
healthy and balanced diet
rest and stay hydrated
take painkillers like
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
– ask your doctor for advice about how much paracetamol you should take as you may not be able to take a normal dose
keep your room well ventilated, wear loose clothing and avoid hot showers and baths if you feel itchy
speak to your doctor if you’re thinking of having a baby
Don’t
do not have unprotected sex – including anal and oral sex
do not drink alcohol – this can increase your risk of developing serious liver problems
do not share toothbrushes, razors or needles with other people
Your close contacts, such as family members, may need to be vaccinated.
Complications of hepatitis B
Most people do not have any lasting problems after having a hepatitis B infection.
In some patients chronic hepatitis B can cause liver damage (
cirrhosis
) and increase your risk of getting
liver cancer
.
It is important that all patients with chronic hepatitis B are followed up in specialist clinics. If required, treatment can control hepatitis B infection, preventing serious complications."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/head-lice-and-nits/,"Head lice and nits
Head lice are tiny insects that live in hair. Nits are the empty egg cases attached to hair that head lice hatch from.
Head lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4 to 11.
They’re largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with.
Head lice nits and bites.
https://dermnetnz.org/
Signs of head lice
Head lice can be difficult to spot, even when the head is closely inspected.
They’re very small whitish or grey-brown insects that range from the size of a pinhead to the size of a sesame seed.
Less reliable signs of head lice include:
small white eggs or nits (egg cases) in the hair behind the ears or at the back of the neck
an itchy scalp
a rash on the back of the neck
feeling as though something is moving in the hair
How to spot head lice
The only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. This is called detection combing.
You can buy detection combs
from your local pharmacy
, supermarket or online. Combs with flat-faced teeth spaced 0.2 to 0.3mm apart are best for removing head lice, although combs with smaller gaps can be used to remove eggs and nits (egg cases) after treatment.
Detection combing can be carried out on dry or wet hair. Dry combing takes less time, but wet combing is more accurate because washing with conditioner stops head lice from moving.
Wet detection combing
To use the wet detection method:
wash the hair with ordinary shampoo
apply plenty of conditioner
use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair
once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb
make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp
draw the comb down from the roots to the ends of the hair with every stroke, and check the comb for lice each time – remove lice by wiping the comb with tissue paper or rinsing it
work through the hair, section by section, so that the whole head of hair is combed through
do this at least twice to help ensure you haven’t missed any areas
continue until you find no more lice
If you find head lice, you should check the rest of your family. Treat everyone found to have head lice on the same day.
Dry detection combing
To use the dry detection method:
use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair
once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb
make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp
draw the comb down from the crown to the ends of the hair with every stroke
look for lice as the comb is drawn through the hair. If you see a louse, trap it against the face of the comb with your thumb to stop if being repelled by static electricity
comb each section of hair 3 or 4 times before moving on to the next section
continue until the whole head has been combed through
How to get rid of head lice and nits
Treatments to get rid of head lice are available to buy from pharmacies, supermarkets and online.
The main treatments are:
lotions and sprays
wet combing
Everyone with head lice in your household should be treated on the same day.
If a treatment doesn’t work the first time, you can:
try it again
try a different treatment
get advice from your school nurse, health visitor, pharmacist or GP
Lotions and sprays for head lice and nits
There are several different products that can be applied to the scalp and hair to kill head lice, including:
dimeticone 4% lotion or lotion spray – applied and left for 8 hours (usually overnight)
dimeticone 4% spray gel – applied and left for 15 minutes
mineral oil and dimeticone spray – applied and left for 15 minutes
isopropyl myristate and cyclomethicone solution – applied and left for 5-10 minutes
Some treatments need to be done twice – 7 days apart. This makes sure that any newly-hatched lice are killed.
Detection combing should usually be done 2 or 3 days after finishing treatment, and again another 7 days after that, to check for any live head lice.
Always check the pack or leaflet to see if a product is suitable for you, particularly if:
you’re pregnant
you’re breastfeeding
your child has head lice and is less than 2 years of age
Your pharmacist can recommend a suitable treatment and advise you on how to use it correctly if necessary.
When to get professional advice
Your pharmacist can advise you about treatments for head lice and nits if you’re not sure which is best for you or your child.
Make sure you carefully follow the instructions that come with the treatment you choose.
Find your nearest pharmacy
You can get advice and treatment on head lice and nits directly from a pharmacy.
Pharmacies
How head lice are spread
Head lice are spread by direct head to head contact. They climb from one person’s hair to another’s.
Head lice:
can’t fly, jump or swim
are very unlikely to be spread by objects like hats, combs and pillows
don’t have a preference for dirty, clean, short or long hair
only affect people
can’t be caught from animals
Once detached from the hair, head lice will usually die within 12 to 24 hours.
Preventing head lice
It’s very difficult to prevent head lice.
You may want to consider regular detection combing if you’re concerned about your children or yourself. For example, on a weekly basis.
Lotions and sprays don’t prevent head lice and should only be used if a live louse has been found in your or your child’s hair.
Staying off work or school and washing clothing and bedding on a hot wash is unnecessary, as it’s unlikely to help prevent the spread of head lice."

You have an extremely painful headache and:
slurred speech or memory loss
a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash
drowsiness or confusion
vision problems
severe pain and redness in one of your eyes
Tension headaches
Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. They’re what we think of as normal, ‘everyday’ headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it.
Normally, tension headaches are not severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days.
What causes a tension headache?
The exact cause is unclear, but tension headaches have been linked to things such as:
stress
poor posture
skipping meals
dehydration
How to treat a tension headache
You can usually treat tension headaches with painkillers such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
. Lifestyle changes may also help, for example:
getting regular sleep
reducing stress
staying well hydrated
Migraines
Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They’re usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as:
nausea
vomiting
increased sensitivity to light or sound
Migraines can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours. Some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time.
How to treat migraines
Most people can treat their migraines with over-the-counter medication from the pharmacist.
If your migraines are severe, you may need to be prescribed stronger medication by your GP. This may be able to relieve and prevent your migraines.

migraines
Cluster headaches
Cluster headaches are a rare type of headache. They occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year.
Cluster headaches are excruciatingly painful. They cause intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as a:
watering or red eye
blocked or runny nose
Pharmacy medications don’t usually ease the symptoms of a cluster headache. Your GP can prescribe specific treatments to ease the pain and help prevent further attacks.
Medication and painkiller headaches
Some headaches are a side effect of taking a particular medication. Frequent headaches can also be caused by taking too many painkillers. This is known as a painkiller or medication-overuse headache.
A medication-overuse headache will usually get better within a few weeks once you stop taking the painkillers that are causing it. But, pain may get worse for a few days before it starts to improve.
Hormone headaches
Headaches in women are often caused by hormones, and many women notice a link with their periods. The
combined contraceptive pill
, the
menopause
and pregnancy are also potential triggers.
You may be able to help reduce headaches associated with your menstrual cycle by:
reducing your stress levels
having a regular sleeping pattern
making sure you do not miss meals
Other causes of headaches
Headaches can also have a number of other causes, including:
drinking too much alcohol
a
head injury
or
concussion
a
cold
or
flu
temporomandibular disorders – problems affecting the ‘chewing’ muscles and the joints between the lower jaw and the base of the skull
sinusitis
– inflammation of the lining of the sinuses
carbon monoxide poisoning
sleep apnoea
– a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/hepatitis-c/,"Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is a liver infection that’s spread through blood.
It can be cured with treatment. But if left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years.
Symptoms of hepatitis C
Many people with hepatitis C won’t have any symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without knowing.
Early symptoms (acute hepatitis C)
Most people will not have symptoms during the first 6 months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C.
If symptoms do develop, they usually occur a few weeks after infection.
Early symptoms may include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
tiredness
loss of appetite
abdominal pain
feeling and being sick
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
Later symptoms (chronic hepatitis C)
Symptoms can vary from person to person. They can also go away for long periods of time and then return.
Later symptoms may include:
feeling tired all the time
joint and muscle aches and pain
feeling sick
brain fog – including problems with memory, concentration and mental tasks such as arithmetic

When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
you have symptoms of hepatitis C
there’s a risk you’re infected with hepatitis C, even if you don’t have symptoms
The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested.
Getting tested for hepatitis C
You can get tested for hepatitis C at:
your GP practice
a sexual health clinic
a drug treatment service
most substance use recovery services
Treatments for hepatitis C
Treatment takes 8 to 12 weeks, and usually cures the infection. But you won’t be immune to hepatitis C. So you should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again.
If the infection is diagnosed early (acute hepatitis), you may not need treatment straight away. Instead, you may have another blood test after a few months to see if your body fights off the virus itself.
If the infection continues for several months (chronic hepatitis), treatment will usually be recommended.
Things you can do yourself
There are things you can do to stop liver damage and prevent the infection spreading to others before you start treatment.
Do
eat a
healthy and balanced diet
exercise regularly
speak to your doctor if you’re thinking of having a baby
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not smoke
do not share toothbrushes, razors, needles or other injecting equipment with other people
How is hepatitis C spread?
You can become infected with hepatitis C if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person.
Some ways the infection can be spread include:
injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters
sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood
from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby
having sex with an infected person without using a condom – if your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested
if you had a blood transfusion in Scotland before September 1991, for example after a traffic accident or during childbirth, you may have been exposed to hepatitis C – all donor blood in Scotland has been screened for hepatitis C since September 1991
having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment
How to prevent hepatitis C
There’s no vaccine for hepatitis C.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of becoming infected.
Do
use
condoms
when having anal sex, or sex with a new partner
get vaccinated against
hepatitis A
and
hepatitis B
if you inject drugs, use a fresh safe injecting kit (available from needle exchanges) every time you inject
Don’t
do not share any drug-injecting equipment – including needles, syringes, spoons and filters
do not share razors or toothbrushes
The risk of getting hepatitis C through vaginal sex is very low. It may be higher if blood is present, such as period (menstrual) blood or from bleeding during anal sex.
Complications of hepatitis C
If left untreated for many years, hepatitis C can cause liver damage (
cirrhosis
). In severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure or
liver cancer
can eventually develop.
Early treatment of hepatitis C prevents these serious complications, while later treatment reduces the risk."

Hay fever is a common allergic condition. It affects up to 1 in 5 people at some point in their life.
You’ll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen.
Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. It contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses to become swollen, irritated and inflamed.
You can have an allergy to:
tree pollen, released during spring
grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer
weed pollen, released late autumn
Many people find their symptoms improve as they get older.
Hay fever self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Symptoms
The symptoms of hay fever include:
frequent sneezing
runny or blocked nose
itchy, red or watery eyes (allergic
conjunctivitis
)
an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears
cough
, caused by postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose)
Less commonly, you may also experience:
the loss of your sense of smell (anosmia)
facial pain (caused by blocked sinuses)
headaches
earache
tiredness and fatigue
If you have
asthma
, your
asthma symptoms
may get worse when you have hay fever.
Treatment
There’s currently no cure for hay fever. But most people can relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent.
The most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it’s very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months.
Treatment options for hay fever include:
antihistamines – which help to prevent an allergic reaction
corticosteroids (steroids)
– which help to reduce inflammation and swelling
When to get professional advice
If you have hay fever, you can get advice and treatment from a pharmacist.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist.
Speak to your GP if:
your symptoms are getting worse
your symptoms do not improve after taking medicines from the pharmacy
you’re experiencing persistent complications of hay fever, such as worsening asthma or repeated episodes of
sinusitis
For severe and persistent hay fever, there’s also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time. This builds resistance to pollen’s allergic effects. But it can take many months or even years to work.
Who’s affected
You can get hay fever at any age. But it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It’s more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected
You’re more likely to develop hay fever if you have a family history of
allergies
, particularly
asthma
or
eczema
.
Self-help tips
It’s sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions.
Do
wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes when you’re outdoors
take a shower and change your clothes after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body
stay indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50 grains per cubic metre of air)
apply a small amount of Vaseline (petroleum gel) to the nostrils to trap pollen
Complications
Hay fever doesn’t pose a serious threat to health. But it can have a negative impact on your quality of life. Very severe hay fever may disrupt your productivity at school or work.
Inflammation of the sinuses (
sinusitis
) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a
middle ear infection (otitis media)
as a result of hay fever."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/immune-system/hiv/,"HIV
HIV is a long-term health condition that is now very easy to manage.
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.
Speak to a sexual health service as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
Symptoms of HIV
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection, which lasts for 2 weeks. This is known as primary HIV infection.
Symptoms of primary HIV infection include:
fever (high temperature)
sore throat
body rash
Other symptoms can include:
tiredness
joint pain
muscle pain
swollen glands
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause symptoms for many years. During this time, HIV continues to be active and causes damage to your immune system.
This means many people who have HIV do not know they’re infected.
Once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include:
weight loss
chronic diarrhoea
night sweats
skin problems
recurrent infections
serious life-threatening illnesses
Testing for HIV
If you think you might have HIV, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
ordering a home test kit
contacting clinics run by charities such as the
Terrence Higgins Trust
or
Waverly Care Scotland
for an appointment
contacting local drug dependency services for an appointment
Services available may vary depending on where you live.
Some private clinics may offer HIV testing, but they may charge.
Who should get tested for HIV?
Anyone who thinks they may have HIV should get tested.
Certain groups of people are at a higher risk and are advised to have regular tests. For example:
gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men should have an HIV test at least once a year, or every 3 months if having sex without
HIV PrEP
or condoms with new or casual partners
women and men from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, should have an HIV test if having sex without using HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners
people who inject drugs or have unprotected sex (sex without condoms or
HIV PrEP
) with people who inject drugs
What does a HIV test involve?
The test for HIV is straightforward, highly accurate and is the only way to know if you’re infected. It involves taking a sample from the body for analysis.
There are 4 main types of HIV test.
Blood test
Where a sample of blood is taken and sent to a lab for analysis. Results are usually available within a few days.
Point of care test
A sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken. This sample doesn’t need to be sent to a lab and the result is available within a few minutes. Anyone who has a reactive point of care test still needs a confirmed laboratory test.
Home sampling kit
Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for analysis. You’ll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies. Anyone who has a reactive home testing kit result is still required to have a laboratory confirmed test.
Home testing kit
Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The result is available within minutes. Check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus multiplying in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage.
These come in tablet form and must be taken every day.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
People who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can’t pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have a normal lifespan and good health.
Without treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it’s not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It’s extremely important to test for HIV if you think you’ve been exposed.
How HIV is passed on
You can get HIV by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex (sex without a
condom
or not taking
HIV PrEP
). It may be possible for HIV to be passed on through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is very low.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment
from mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication
from mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication
blood transfusion (outside of the UK)
Who is most at risk?
People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include people who are not taking HIV PrEP medication and who are:
men who have had unprotected anal sex with men
women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men
people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high HIV prevalence country
people who inject drugs
people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs
people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection (STI)
How to prevent HIV
Safer sex
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a
condom
for vaginal, anal and oral sex. If you’re having anal sex it’s important to also use water-based or silicon-based lubricant.
HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
Taking
HIV PrEP
before you’re exposed to HIV means there’s a drug inside of you to block HIV if it gets into your body, so it can’t infect you.
HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
If you think you may have recently been exposed to HIV and you haven’t taken HIV PrEP medication or used a condom, you should take PEP medication.
PEP is a form of emergency HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.
PEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.
PEP is available from
sexual health services
or out of hours from
A&E
.
If you inject drugs
If you inject drugs, you should never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs).
You can get free clean needles and other injecting equipment from your local injecting equipment providers, which are sometimes also called
needle exchanges
.
Other STIs
If you’ve been diagnosed with HIV you should get tested for all STIs and blood borne viruses including:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
hepatitis B
hepatitis C

About Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.
The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.
In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.
The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.
Read more about the
symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Who’s affected?
Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected.
What causes Hodgkin lymphoma?
The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:
you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system
you take immunosuppressant medication
you’ve previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes
glandular fever
You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.
Read more about the
causes of Hodgkin lymphoma
.
How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed
The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a
biopsy
.
This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.
Read more about
diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Treatment
Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it’s also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.
The main treatments used are
chemotherapy
, followed by
radiotherapy
or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn’t generally used as a treatment for the condition.
Read more about:
treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma
complications of Hodgkin lymphoma
Symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma
The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches.
The swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection.
However, it’s highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have
swollen lymph nodes
, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.
Other symptoms
Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:
night sweats
unintentional weight loss
a high temperature (fever)
a persistent
cough
or feeling of
breathlessness
persistent itching of the skin all over the body
Other symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have
abdominal pain
or
indigestion
A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to:
persistent tiredness or fatigue
an increased risk of infections
excessive bleeding – such as
nosebleeds
, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin
In some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their lymph glands when they drink alcohol.
When to seek medical advice
Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.
While the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by Hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out.
Causes of Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn’t known.
The DNA gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably.
The abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:
bone marrow
spleen
liver
skin
lungs
Who’s most at risk?
While the cause of the initial mutation that triggers Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:
having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as
HIV
having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant
being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – a common virus that causes
glandular fever
having previously had
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
, possibly because of treatment with
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
being very overweight (
obese
) – this may be more of a risk factor in women than men
Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and isn’t thought to run in families. Although your risk is increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it’s not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault or lifestyle factors.
Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.
Diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma
If you speak to your GP because you’re concerned about symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma, they’ll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.
If necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests.
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.
To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, read the
NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral
.
If you’re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.
Biopsy
A
biopsy
involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.
Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a
local anaesthetic
(where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and a
general anaesthetic
may be required (where you’re asleep).
A pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.
Further testing
If a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be needed to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.
Further tests may include:
blood tests
– samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidneys are working
bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the cancer has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic
chest
X-ray
– this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body, to check the spread of the cancer
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
– this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it’s usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working
Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma
When testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. Staging means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread.
The main stages of Hodgkin lymphoma are:
stage 1 – the cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)
stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm
stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm
stage 4 – the cancer has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow
Health professionals also add the letters A or B to your stage, to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.
A is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. B is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.
Treating Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.
Your treatment plan
Your specific treatment plan will depend on your general health and your age, as many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.
Discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Your MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you. However, you shouldn’t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.
Treatment options
The main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. In a few cases, chemotherapy may be combined with steroid medication.
Surgery isn’t generally used to treat the condition, except for the
biopsy
used to diagnose it.
Overall, treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is highly effective and most people with the condition are eventually cured.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a type of cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. This medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.
If doctors think your cancer is curable, you’ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.
Chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed.
Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:
fatigue
breathlessness
increased vulnerability to infection
bleeding and bruising more easily
If you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.
Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include:
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
mouth ulcers
tiredness
skin rashes
hair loss
infertility
, which may be temporary or permanent
Most side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
High-dose chemotherapy
If regular chemotherapy is unsuccessful or Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment, you may have a course of chemotherapy at a higher dose.
However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplant to replace the damaged bone marrow.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
is most often used to treat early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body.
Treatment is normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You shouldn’t have to stay in hospital between appointments.
Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary and will be directly related to the part of your body being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.
Other common side effects include:
tiredness
nausea and vomiting
dry mouth
loss of appetite
Most side effects are temporary, but there’s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.
Read more about:
side effects of radiotherapy
complications of Hodgkin lymphoma
Steroid medication
Steroid medication
is sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy as a more intensive treatment for advanced cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, or if initial treatment hasn’t worked.
The steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy.
Common side effects of steroid medication include:
increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain
indigestion
problems sleeping
feeling agitated
The side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.
Rituximab
If you’re diagnosed with a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab.
Rituximab is a type of biological therapy called a monoclonal antibody. It attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell.
It’s given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours.
Side effects of the drug can include:
flu
-like symptoms, such as
headaches
, fever and muscle pain
tiredness
nausea
diarrhoea
You may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. Any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication.
Follow-up
After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
These appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time.

Complications of Hodgkin lymphoma
Some people treated for Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they’ve been cured.
Weakened immune system
Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you’re being treated.
If you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of
antibiotics
to prevent infections.
It’s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, as prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.
Symptoms of infection include:
a high temperature (fever)
headache
aching muscles
diarrhoea
tiredness
Vaccination
You should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date.
However, it’s important to speak to your GP or care team about this, as it may not be safe for you to have ‘live’ vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.
Examples of live vaccines include the:
shingles vaccine
BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)
MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)
Infertility
Chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.
Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.
In some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.
Second cancers
People who have had Hodgkin lymphoma are more likely to get lymphoma,
leukaemia
or other cancers in the future. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy further increase this risk.
Second cancers, such as
breast cancer
or
lung cancer
, usually develop more than 10 years after you’re treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. In rare cases, other types of cancer, such as leukaemia or other lymphomas, develop after only a few years.
You can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.
You should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you’re invited to.
Other health problems
The risk of developing other health conditions in the future, such as
cardiovascular disease
and lung disease, is also higher in people who have had Hodgkin lymphoma.
You should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP for further advice."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/hepatitis-a/,"Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a liver infection that’s spread in the poo of an infected person. The chance of getting it in the UK is low.
Hepatitis A is not usually serious. Most people get better within a couple of months.
A hepatitis A vaccine is available on the NHS if you’re at increased risk.
Symptoms of hepatitis A
Some people with hepatitis A, particularly young children, won’t have any symptoms.
If you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur around 4 weeks after exposure to the hepatitis A virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A include:
feeling tired and generally unwell
joint and muscle pain
a high temperature (fever)
loss of appetite
feeling or being sick
pain in the upper-right part of your tummy
a

When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus – emergency treatment can help prevent infection if given within a few days of exposure
you have symptoms of hepatitis A
you’re at increased risk of hepatitis A
Diagnosing hepatitis A
A
blood test
can check whether you have hepatitis A. It can also rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms, but which may require treatment to prevent more serious problems.
Your friends, family and sexual partners may need to be tested too.
Treatments for hepatitis A
There’s currently no cure for hepatitis A. It will usually get better its own within a couple of months.
Once hepatitis A passes, you’ll normally be immune to it for life.

get plenty of rest
take painkillers such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
for any aches and pains – ask your GP for advice as you may need to take lower doses than normal or avoid certain medications until you’ve recovered
have a cool, airy environment
wear loose clothing
eat smaller, lighter meals to help reduce feeling sick and vomiting
wash your hands with soap and water regularly
wash soiled laundry separately on a hot cycle
clean the toilet, flush handles and taps more often than usual
Don’t
do not drink alcohol
do not have very hot baths or showers
do not prepare food for other people, if you can avoid it
do not share towels
do not go to work or school until at least a week after your jaundice or other symptoms started
do not have sex until at least a week after your jaundice or other symptoms started
Treatments from your doctor
Speak to your GP practice if your symptoms get worse or haven’t started to improve within a couple of months. They can prescribe medications to help with itchiness, nausea or vomiting, if needed.
Long-term hepatitis A
Hepatitis A can occasionally last for many months.
In rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes liver failure. People most at risk include those with other liver problems and elderly people. If liver failure does occur, a
liver transplant
is usually needed to treat it.
How is hepatitis A spread?
Hepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of cleanliness and food hygiene are poor.
You can get the infection from:
drinking unclean water
eating food that’s been washed or grown in unclean water
eating food that’s been handled by an infected person
close contact with someone who has hepatitis A
having sex with someone who has the infection – particularly if you touch their anus with your fingers, mouth or tongue
injecting drugs using unclean equipment
Someone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around 2 weeks before their symptoms appear until about 1 week after the symptoms first develop.
The hepatitis A vaccine
Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A.
The hepatitis A vaccine isn’t routinely offered in the UK because the risk of infection is low for most people.
It’s only recommended for people at increased risk, including:
close contacts of someone with hepatitis A
people
planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread
, particularly if levels of cleanliness and food hygiene are expected to be poor
people with any type of long-term (chronic)
liver disease
men who have sex with other men
people who inject illegal drugs
people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – for example sewage workers, staff at homeless shelters, and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas"

This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called Hodgkin lymphoma.
Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma has a very good success rate and most people are cured.
Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s natural defences against infection.
Lymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body’s cells. Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops.
In lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. These lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour).
There are 2 main types of lymphoma:
Hodgkin lymphoma
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
Although these cancers are both lymphomas, they are different and need different treatments. Your doctors will do tests to find out which type you have.
Symptoms
One of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin.
Lumps can also be inside the body. A commonplace would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness.
Some people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. Itching of the skin is also quite common.
Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. Doctors call these symptoms ‘B symptoms’.
Most of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. For example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. But if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have Hodgkin lymphoma, go to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.
Causes
It’s not known what causes Hodgkin lymphoma. Research is going on to try to find out. Remember, though, it isn’t anything that you’ve done.
Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in young people over the age of 10. About 1 in 6 of all cancers affecting young people between 15 and 24 is a Hodgkin lymphoma.
Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and can’t be passed on to other people or family members.
If you’re looking for information about Hodgkin lymphoma in people of all ages, read our general

About idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
It’s not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people around 70-75 years of age and is rare in people under 50.
Several treatments can help reduce the rate at which IPF gets worse, but there’s currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs.
Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.
Symptoms can include:
shortness of breath
a persistent dry
cough
tiredness
loss of appetite and weight loss
rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)
Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.
When to get medical advice
See your GP if you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than three weeks.
These symptoms aren’t normal and shouldn’t be ignored.
If your GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as:
breathing (lung function) tests
blood tests
a chest
X-ray
and
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a lung
biopsy
(where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed)
Read more about the
tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
.
Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. This causes the lungs to become stiff and means it’s difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.
The reason this happens isn’t clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown.
IPF has been linked to:
exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust
viral infections
a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
smoking
But it’s not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF.
Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
There’s currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.
Treatments include:
self-care measures – such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly
medication to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens – such as pirfenidone and nintedanib
breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you’re at home and/or while you’re out and about
pulmonary rehabilitation – exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily
a
lung transplant
– this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare
Read more about
how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated
.
Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable.
Some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating.
Other problems can also sometimes develop, including
chest infections
,
pulmonary hypertension
and
heart failure
.
It’s very difficult to predict how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis. Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it’s getting worse quickly or slowly.
Before the availability of specific treatments like pirfenidone and nintedanib about half of people with IPF lived at least three years from their diagnosis. Around 1 in 5 survived for more than five years.
It’s hoped these figures will be improved by the availability of new treatments to slow the disease’s progression.
Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
The most common symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is shortness of breath, often when physically active, which can get worse over time.
At first, many people ignore their breathlessness (especially older patients) and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But as the disease progresses and lung damage becomes more severe, even light activity like getting dressed or having a shower can cause breathlessness.
Other symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis include:
a persistent dry
cough
tiredness
loss of appetite and weight loss
In up to half of all cases, there is also a change in the shape of the finger and toenails. This thickening of tissue at the base of the finger and toenails is known as digital clubbing. The exact cause of clubbing is unknown, but it can occur in people with various chest and heart diseases.
Secondary conditions
The strain IPF can place on your lungs and your heart can trigger a number of secondary conditions, outlined below.
Chest infection
You will have an increased risk of developing chest and airway infections such as:
bronchitis
– an infection of the airway of the lungs
pneumonia
– an infection of the air sacs of your lungs
influenza (flu)
Symptoms of a chest infection include:
worsening breathlessness
chest pain
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
sweating and shivering
Pulmonary hypertension
Around a third of people with IPF will also go on to develop
pulmonary hypertension
. Pulmonary hypertension is when blood pressure inside the arteries connecting the lungs to the heart is dangerously high.
Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:
dizziness
feeling faint
chest pain (angina)
a racing heartbeat (tachycardia)
Read more about
symptoms of pulmonary hypertension
.
Heart failure
Heart failure
, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body, can develop when IPF becomes severe.
This is due to a combination of factors, including a build-up of blood in the right side of the heart (the side that pumps blood to the lungs), which develops because it is difficult to pump blood through the scarred lung tissue. The poor supply of oxygen from the diseased lungs to the heart muscle also contributes to heart failure.
Heart failure can cause various symptoms, including:
worsening breathlessness
extreme tiredness and weakness
swelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema) caused by a build-up of fluid
Read more about the
symptoms of heart failure
.
Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
The exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is not known. Idiopathic means having no known cause.
The current theory is that IPF is triggered when cells that line the lung alveoli (air sacs) become damaged by exposure to one of several substances or viruses.
The damaged cells try to repair themselves but the process becomes uncontrolled, resulting in thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue. The amount of oxygen that can pass from the lungs into the blood is then significantly reduced.
Triggers
A number of factors have been suggested as possible triggers for the initial damage to the cells lining the alveoli. Most experts agree that the two most significant risk factors are:
being a smoker or having smoked in the past
occupational exposure to certain types of dust – jobs that involve working with wood, metal, textile, stone, cattle or farming may increase the risk of IPF
Other possible risk factors include:
viral infections – such as the Epstein-Barr virus or
hepatitis C
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
(where the acid from your stomach rises back up into your throat) – this may be accidentally inhaled into the lungs, causing damage to the alveoli
chronic aspiration – where food, drink or saliva enter the lungs and is not coughed back up, often due to a related condition
environmental pollutants or dust
genetic tendency – the condition appears to run in some families but this only seems to be the case in around 5% of people with IPF
As IPF is such a rare condition it is hard to estimate how much of an impact these risk factors can have on your chance of developing it.
Diagnosing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other lung conditions, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
.
Your GP can refer you to hospital specialists for a number of tests to help rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.
The checks and tests you may have include:
Medical history and examination
Breathing and blood tests
Chest X-ray and CT scan
Bronchoscopy
Lung biopsy
Medical history and examination
Your doctor will ask about your medical history and whether there are other factors that could be causing a problem with your lungs, such as whether you:
smoke or have smoked in the past
have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos
have other medical conditions
They may also:
check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis)
look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing)
ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless
Breathing and blood tests
Lung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests) assess how well your lungs work and can help indicate what the problem may be.
These tests measure:
how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs
how much air your lungs can hold
how well your lungs transfer oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from it (this can be checked using a
blood test
)
A commonly used lung function test is spirometry. During the test, you breathe into a mouthpiece that’s attached to a monitor.
Chest X-ray and CT scan
A chest
X-ray
doesn’t show the lungs in much detail, but it can help doctors spot some more obvious problems that could be causing your symptoms, such as cancer or a build-up of fluid.
If IPF is suspected, the chest x-ray will be followed by a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
.
A CT scan is similar to an X-ray, but lots more images are taken and these are put together by a computer to create a more detailed image of your lungs.
This can help your doctor spot signs of scarring in your lungs.
Bronchoscopy
If doctors still aren’t sure what the problem is after the tests described above, they may suggest having a bronchoscopy.
This is a test where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera (bronchoscope) is passed down into your airways.
Your doctor can then look for anything abnormal and can take small tissue samples for testing.
You’ll usually be awake for a bronchoscopy and it may cause coughing.
Local anaesthetic
will be used to numb your throat so it doesn’t hurt and you may also be given a sedative injection which will make you feel sleepy during the procedure.
Lung biopsy
If other tests aren’t conclusive, a lung
biopsy
may need to be carried out.
This involves keyhole surgery to remove a small sample of lung tissue so it can be analysed for signs of scarring.
The procedure is performed under a
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep). Your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your side and an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera and a light at the end) is inserted into the area between the lungs and the chest wall.
The surgeon can see the lung tissue through the endoscope and is able obtain a small sample.
Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
There’s currently no cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The main aim of treatment is to relieve the symptoms as much as possible and slow down its progression.
The main treatments are:
Self-care
Medication
Oxygen support
Pulmonary rehabilitation
Lung transplant
As the condition becomes more advanced,
end of life (palliative) care
will be offered.
Self-care
There are several things you can do to stay as healthy as possible if you have IPF.
These include:
stopping smoking
if you smoke
exercise regularly
and stay as fit as you can
eat a
healthy, balanced diet
make sure you get the annual flu jab and one-off pneumococcal vaccination – these infections can be more serious if you have a lung condition
try to keep away from people with
chest infections
and
colds
whenever possible
Medication
There are two medications that can help slow down the progression of IPF in some people: pirfenidone and nintedanib.
Some people also take a medication called N-acetylcysteine, although its benefits are uncertain.
Pirfenidone
Pirfenidone helps to slow the development of scarring in the lungs by reducing the activity of the immune system. It’s normally taken as capsules three times a day.
It’s recommended if breathing tests have shown your lung capacity is 50-80% of what would normally be expected.
If your condition gets worse despite taking pirfenidone and your lung capacity falls by 10% or more within a year, the medication will usually be stopped.
Side effects of pirfenidone can include:
feeling sick
tiredness
diarrhoea
indigestion
a rash caused by exposure to sunlight
For further information see, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on
pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
.
Nintedanib
Nintedanib is a newer medication that can also help slow down scarring of the lungs in some people with IPF. It’s normally taken as capsules twice a day.
Like pirfenidone, it may be used if you have a lung capacity 50-80% of what would normally be expected and should be stopped if your lung capacity falls by 10% or more in a year while taking it.
Side effects of nintedanib can include:
diarrhoea
feeling and being sick
abdominal (tummy) pain
loss of appetite and weight loss
For further information, see the NICE guidelines on
nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
.
N-acetylcysteine
N-acetylcysteine is what’s known as an antioxidant. It’s available from many health shops and is usually taken as tablets.
There is some limited evidence to suggest it may reduce the amount of scar tissue in the lungs, although other studies have not shown any benefit.
If you’re considering taking N-acetylcysteine, you should check with your specialist first as it may not be safe or suitable for everyone with IPF.
Oxygen support
IPF can cause levels of oxygen in your blood fall, which can make you feel more breathless.
If this happens, oxygen treatment can help with your breathing and allow you to be more active.
Oxygen is taken through nasal tubes or a mask attached to a small machine. This device provides a much higher level of oxygen than the air. The tubes from the machine are long, so you’ll be able to move around your home while connected.
Read further about
home oxygen treatment
.
Portable oxygen devices that you can use while you’re out and about are also available.
Pulmonary rehabilitation
Pulmonary rehabilitation is used for many long-term lung conditions and aims to help patients come to terms with their condition, learn the best ways to deal with it and improve their ability to function on a daily basis without severe breathlessness.
Courses in pulmonary rehabilitation are usually held locally and may involve:
education about pulmonary fibrosis
physical activity
breathing exercises
advice on nutrition
psychological support
a social support network
Lung transplant
If your condition continues to get worse despite treatment, your specialist may recommend a
lung transplant
. The decision to have a transplant will be based on:
how bad your condition is
how quickly your condition is getting worse
your age and general health
how much your condition is likely to improve after a transplant
whether a donor lung is available
A lung transplant can significantly improve life expectancy in people with IPF, although it’s a major procedure that puts a great strain on the body.
Few people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are suitable candidates for a transplant and donor lungs are scarce.
Palliative care
If you’re told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your IPF or you decide to decline treatment, your GP or care team will provide you with support and treatment to relieve your symptoms.
This is called palliative care.
You can choose to receive palliative care:
at home
in a care home
in hospital
in a hospice
Your doctor or care team should work with you to establish a clear plan based on your wishes.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/huntingtons-disease/,"Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain causing them to stop working properly. It’s passed on (inherited) from a person’s parents.
The damage to the brain gets worse over time. It can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health.
Symptoms of Huntington’s disease
People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington’s disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.
The condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies.
Early symptoms
Behavioural changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington’s disease. These changes often include:
a lack of emotions and not recognising the needs of others
periods of aggression, excitement,
depression
, antisocial behaviour and anger
apathy – causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care
difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations
irritability and impulsiveness
Speak to your GP if:
you’re worried you might have early symptoms of Huntington’s disease, especially if there’s a history of the condition in your family
Later symptoms
Further symptoms of Huntington’s might include:
psychiatric problems – some people develop
obsessive behaviours
, delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, or
suicidal
thoughts
uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body
difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don’t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections
communication problems – difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech
sexual problems – a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands
balance problems
In the later stages of Huntington’s disease, the person will need full nursing care.
Death is usually from a secondary cause, like
pneumonia
or another infection.
You might find the
palliative care section
useful if you’re caring for someone who’s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care.
Juvenile Huntington’s disease
Juvenile Huntington’s disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. Common signs include:
a rapid decline in school performance
changes in handwriting
problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to the
features of Parkinson’s disease
)
seizures (fits)
Causes of Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease is caused by a faulty gene. Cells in parts of the brain are very sensitive to the effects of the faulty gene. This makes them function poorly and eventually die.
A parent with the Huntington’s disease gene has one good copy of the gene and one faulty copy.
This means there’s a:
50:50 chance that each of their children will develop Huntington’s disease – affected children can pass the gene to children they may have
50:50 chance that each of their children won’t develop Huntington’s disease – unaffected children can’t pass the gene to children they may have
It’s difficult to predict how old a child will be when they develop the condition if they inherit the abnormal gene.
In around 3% of cases of Huntington’s disease, there’s no obvious family history of the condition. This could be because relatives with the condition died before they were diagnosed with it. In rare cases, it’s due to a new fault in the gene that causes Huntington’s disease.
Diagnosing Huntington’s disease
If you have symptoms of Huntington’s disease, your GP will refer you to a specialist clinician.
The specialist will ask about your symptoms to:
see if it’s likely you have Huntington’s disease
rule out similar conditions
They’ll examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance and walking. They’ll find out if you have any involuntary movements, such as chorea (fidgety or jerky movements).
Tests to diagnose Huntington’s disease
You might have genetic testing to confirm if you have Huntington’s disease if:
you’re showing symptoms of the condition and it runs in your family
your doctor strongly suspects you have the condition
Diagnosis is based on the doctor recognising a number of factors like neurological examination, family history and genetic testing.
Genetic test
The children of someone with Huntington’s disease can take a genetic test after the age of 18 to see whether they’ve inherited the faulty gene.
It’s possible to have the gene change and still be healthy when you’re tested. This is known as “premanifest Huntington’s disease”.
If they’ve inherited the faulty gene, they’ll develop Huntington’s disease, but it’s not possible to work out when.
You can ask your GP or neurologist for an appointment at a genetic clinic. You’ll receive some counselling and blood samples will be taken. Your DNA from the blood samples will be analysed to see whether you have inherited the faulty gene.
Scottish Huntington’s Association
has a
national youth service
to help and support children and young people who are living within a Huntington’s family.
Brain scan
In the early stages of Huntington’s disease, there may not be any specific changes on the brain scan. A doctor might use a brain scan if they’re concerned there may be other problems in addition to Huntington’s disease.
A brain scan may involve having a
computerised tomography (CT scan)
or a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
Getting tested in pregnancy
If you’re pregnant and know you have the Huntington’s disease gene, it’s possible for your unborn baby to be tested during pregnancy at 11 weeks. You can discuss this with a genetic counselling team.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be used when one partner is known to have or is at risk of having the faulty gene.
It involves having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. The embryo is genetically tested to make sure it doesn’t have the faulty gene before being implanted into the womb.
Should I get tested?
Not everyone wants to know if they’ve inherited the faulty gene. It’s a personal choice.
Some people say they would rather not know because they want to enjoy their life and they may die of other causes before the condition develops.
If you’re considering genetic testing, your GP will refer you to a genetic counsellor first.
Treating Huntington’s disease
There’s no cure for Huntington’s disease. Medication and therapies can help treat some of the symptoms.
Speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, can help with communication and day-to-day living.
Regular exercise
is also very important. People who are active tend to feel much better physically and mentally than those who don’t.
Medication for Huntington’s disease
Most of these medications have side effects, like tiredness. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if the side effects are symptoms of the condition or a result of the medication.
Antidepressants to treat depression
Antidepressants
can help improve mood swings and treat
depression
.
Mood stabilisers to treat irritability or mood swings
Mood stabilisers may be considered as a treatment for irritability.
Some mood stabilizers can’t be used during pregnancy.
Medication to suppress involuntary movements
Medication can suppress involuntary movements. In the UK, antipsychotic medicines are usually preferred.
Antipsychotic medication might help control delusions and violent outbursts, but they can have severe side effects, such as:
stiffness and rigidity
sedation
moving slowly
Living with Huntington’s disease
Help is available to assist people with Huntington’s disease in their day-to-day life. This might include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.
Daily routines such as getting dressed and eating meals can be frustrating and exhausting. The types of help outlined below aim to ease the strain of the condition by improving skills that may deteriorate.
Help with communication
Speech and language therapy can improve communication skills, and memory. It can help with
swallowing problems
.
Communication aids can sometimes be helpful, as they allow communication without the need for talking. For example, you can point to symbols on a chart to show your mood or whether you’re hungry.
The family of someone with Huntington’s disease can try alternative ways of communicating if speech is a problem.
Help with mealtimes
People with Huntington’s disease might need to have a high-calorie diet. A dietitian can help you work out an appropriate diet plan.
Food should be easy to chew, swallow and digest. It can be cut into small pieces or puréed to prevent choking. Feeding equipment like special straws and non-slip mats can help.
At some point, you might be offered a feeding tube that goes into the stomach. If a person doesn’t want to be artificially fed, they should tell their family and doctor. They may want to consider making an
advance decision (a living will)
or a statement of wishes and preferences.
Occupational therapy
An occupational therapist (OT) can help with day-to-day activities. Your home can be adapted by social services to make life easier for a person with Huntington’s disease.
You might also need to think about wheelchair access.
Read more about
occupational therapy
and how it can help.
Physiotherapy
A physiotherapist can help with mobility and balance. It uses a range of treatments, including manipulation, massage, exercise, electrotherapy and hydrotherapy. You may be referred to a physiotherapist through your GP or social services.
Current research
Research is underway to find disease-modifying medication and new treatments for Huntington’s disease.
Progress has been made in identifying potential ways of slowing down or halting the condition by “switching off” the faulty gene that causes Huntington’s disease.
Speak to your healthcare professional if you’re interested in taking part in research for Huntington’s disease.
Financial information and support
It’s worth finding out what benefits you may be entitled to if you have Huntington’s disease, or if you’re looking after someone with the condition.
The
Scottish Huntington’s Association
Financial Wellbeing Service provides information, confidential advice and support to people living with Huntington’s disease.
You can also contact the
Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB)
Read more about
benefits if you need care, and carers’ benefits
Driving
A person diagnosed with Huntington’s disease who’s started to experience symptoms should inform the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
The condition will affect their ability to drive.
The DVLA will write to your doctor, with your permission, to ask for their opinion about your condition. Based on that information, they’ll decide whether you can still drive and for how long before another assessment is needed.
There’s no need to tell the DVLA if you’re carrying the faulty gene but haven’t yet developed symptoms.

About hiatus hernia
Diagnosing hiatus hernia
Treating hiatus hernia
Complications of hiatus hernia
About hiatus hernia
A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (‘hiatus’) in the diaphragm.
The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy).
Hiatus hernia and heartburn
A hiatus hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
.
GORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly.
Your oesophagus can become severely irritated, because it’s not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (
dysphagia
).
You should see your GP if you have frequent and severe
symptoms of GORD
.
What causes a hiatus hernia?
It’s not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen.
Hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn’t develop properly.
Who’s affected
Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it’s more common in people who are:
over 50 years of age
overweight
pregnant
It’s estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia.
There’s also a rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth.
Types of hiatus hernia
There are 2 main types of hiatus hernia. They are:
sliding hiatus hernias – hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type)
para-oesophageal hiatus hernias – also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5 to 15% of hiatus hernias are of this type)
These pages mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an
X-ray
or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.

Treating a hiatus hernia
Treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn.
Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven’t worked.
Lifestyle advice may include:
eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day
avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3 hours after eating or drinking
removing any foods or drinks from your diet that make your symptoms worse
If a hiatus hernia isn’t causing any noticeable problems, it doesn’t usually need to be treated.
Surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there’s a risk of serious complications.

Further problems
It’s rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk of
oesophageal cancer
.

complications of a hiatus hernia

Diagnosing hiatus hernia
A hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or X-ray.
Gastroscopy
A gastroscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor.
The gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. The procedure may be carried out using a
local anaesthetic
or a sedative to help you relax.
Barium meal X-ray
The barium meal
X-ray
, also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of identifying a hiatus hernia.
As part of the test, you’ll be asked to drink some barium solution. Barium is a non-toxic chemical that shows up clearly on an X-ray. Once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of X-rays will be taken to identify any problems.
If you need to have a barium meal X-ray, you won’t be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.
You’ll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. This will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an X-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. Your bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach.
A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system.
You may feel slightly sick after a barium meal X-ray and the barium may cause
constipation
. Your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system.
Treating hiatus hernia
Treatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it’s causing problems.
In most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causes
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
. GORD can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth.
Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective.
Lifestyle changes
There are several things you can do yourself to help relieve
symptoms of GORD
caused by a hiatus hernia. These include:
eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day
avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3 hours after eating or drinking
avoiding drinking during the night
removing certain foods from your diet if you think they make your symptoms worse
avoiding
alcohol
, caffeine, chocolate, tomatoes, fatty foods, spicy foods and acidic food or drinks, such as citrus fruit juice, if they make your symptoms worse
avoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking
raising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don’t use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomen
If you’re overweight,
losing weight
may help to reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.
If you smoke, you should try to give up. Tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse.

stopping smoking
.
Medication
A number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of hiatus hernia. These are described below.
Antacids
Antacid medicines can relieve some of the symptoms of hiatus hernia. They come in liquid or tablet form and can be swallowed or chewed. They help to neutralise stomach acid when they reach the oesophagus and stomach by making it less acidic.
However, antacid medicines don’t work for everyone. They’re not a long-term solution if symptoms persist or you’re in extreme discomfort.
Antacids shouldn’t be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed by your body. They may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice.
Alginates
Alginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. They work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid.
H2-receptor antagonists
In some cases, a medicine known as an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing GORD. Examples of H2RAs include cimetidine, famotidine (PepcidTwo) and ranitidine.
H2RAs block the effects of the chemical histamine, which your body uses to produce stomach acid. H2RAs therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.
Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon. However, possible side effects may include
diarrhoea
,
headaches
, tiredness and a rash.
Some H2RAs are available over the counter at pharmacies. These types of HR2As are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you’re not sure whether these medicines are suitable for you.
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)
Your GP may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Examples of the PPIs you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole.
Most people tolerate PPIs well and side effects are uncommon. When they do occur, they’re usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick or
constipation
.
To minimise any side effects, your GP will prescribe the lowest possible dose of PPIs they think will be effective. You should let your GP know if the prescribed dose of PPIs doesn’t work. A stronger dose may be needed.
Surgery
Surgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area) if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication.
You may also want to consider surgery if you have persistent and troublesome symptoms, but don’t want to take medication on a long-term basis.
Prior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal pH studies).
Laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF)
A procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat GORD and sliding hiatus hernias.
LNF is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in.
During LNF, the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. This should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach.
LNF is carried out under
general anaesthetic
, so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort. The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete.
After having LNF, you should be able to leave hospital after you’ve recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. This is usually within 2 to 3 days. Depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks.
For the first 6 weeks after surgery, it’s recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak.
Common side effects of LNF include difficulties swallowing (
dysphagia
), belching, bloating and
flatulence
.
These side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. However, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. In such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required.
Para-oesophageal hiatus hernia
If you have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (see
complications of a hiatus hernia
for more information).
Complications of hiatus hernia
Complications from a hiatus hernia are rare, but they can be serious.
Hiatus hernias that slide in and out of the chest area (sliding hiatus hernias) can cause
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
. This is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (gullet). This can damage the oesophagus, increasing the risk of problems.
Oesophageal ulcers
Damage to the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis) caused by stomach acid can lead to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making swallowing difficult.
Ulcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlying
symptoms of GORD
. In most cases, over-the-counter medicines called antacids or alginates are used to treat the condition.
Read more about
treating GORD
.
Oesophageal stricture
Repeated damage to the lining of your oesophagus can lead to the formation of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is allowed to build up, it can cause your oesophagus to become narrowed. This is known as oesophageal stricture.
An oesophageal stricture can make swallowing food difficult and painful. Oesophageal strictures can be treated using a tiny balloon to dilate (widen) the oesophagus. This procedure is usually carried out under a
local anaesthetic
.
Barrett’s oesophagus and cancer
Repeated damage to the oesophagus can also lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus.
Barrett’s oesophagus doesn’t usually cause noticeable symptoms, other than those associated with GORD. However, Barrett’s oesophagus can increase your risk of developing
oesophageal cancer
.
If you have persistent reflux symptoms for more than 3 weeks, you should talk to your GP because you may need some investigations.
Strangulated hernia
In some cases, a hiatus hernia causes part of the stomach to push up next to the oesophagus. This is known as a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. GORD doesn’t usually occur in these cases, but there’s a risk of the hernia becoming strangulated.
Strangulation occurs when the hernia becomes knotted and the blood supply to the area is cut off. Emergency surgery is usually required to correct the problem."

About high cholesterol
Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. It’s vital for the normal functioning of the body. Cell membranes, hormones and vitamin D are created by your body using cholesterol.
There are 2 main sources of the cholesterol in your blood:
cholesterol in the food you eat
cholesterol produced by your liver
Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health.
High cholesterol, on its own, doesn’t usually cause any symptoms but increases your risk of serious health conditions.
About cholesterol
Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they’re called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. From there it’s either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. For this reason, HDL is referred to as “good cholesterol” and higher levels are better.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. If there’s too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. For this reason, LDL is known as “bad cholesterol”.
The amount of cholesterol in the blood, both HDL and LDL , is measured with a
blood test
.
The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease.
Why should I lower my cholesterol?
Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of:
narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)
heart attack
stroke
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) – often known as a “mini stroke”
peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body.
Your risk of developing
coronary heart disease
also rises as your blood’s cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (
angina
).
What causes high cholesterol?
Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.
These include:
an unhealthy diet – in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat
smoking
– a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)
having
diabetes
or
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
having a family history of stroke or heart disease
There’s also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. This can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily.
Read more about the causes of high cholesterol
When should my cholesterol levels be tested?
Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you:
have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
have a family history of early cardiovascular disease
have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition
are overweight
have high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels
Read more about how cholesterol is tested
What should my cholesterol levels be?
Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L.
As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be:
5mmol/L or less for healthy adults
4mmol/L or less for those at high risk
As a general guide, LDL levels should be:
3mmol/L or less for healthy adults
2mmol/L or less for those at high risk
An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease.
Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease.
Cholesterol is only one risk factor. The level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present.
How can I lower my cholesterol level?
The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain
a healthy, balanced diet
. It’s important to keep your diet low in fatty food.
You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also
help prevent high cholesterol from returning
.
Other lifestyle changes, such as taking
regular exercise
and
giving up smoking
, can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol.
If these measures don’t reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as
statins
.
Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. The benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks.
Read more about how high cholesterol is treated
Causes of high cholesterol
Many different factors can contribute to high blood cholesterol, including lifestyle factors like smoking, an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, as well as having an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
Lifestyle
Your lifestyle can increase your risk of developing high blood cholesterol.
This includes:
an unhealthy diet – some foods, such as liver, kidneys and eggs, contain cholesterol (dietary cholesterol), but this has little effect on blood cholesterol: it’s the total amount of saturated fat in your diet that’s more important to watch; read more about
preventing high cholesterol
lack of exercise or physical activity – this can increase your level of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL)
obesity
– if you’re overweight, it’s likely that you’ll have higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
– regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol can increase your cholesterol and triglyceride levels
smoking
– a chemical in cigarettes called acrolein stops “good cholesterol” (HDL) transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)
Underlying conditions
People with
high blood pressure (hypertension)
and
diabetes
often have high cholesterol.
Some other health conditions that can also cause raised levels of cholesterol include:
kidney disease
liver disease
an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
Treating the underlying condition can help to reduce cholesterol.
Other factors
There are a number of factors associated with high cholesterol that can’t be changed that increase your risk of having a
heart attack
or
stroke
. Doctors refer to these as “fixed factors”.
They include:
family history of early
coronary heart disease (CHD)
or stroke – you’re more likely to have high cholesterol if you have a close male relative (father or brother) aged under 55, or a female relative (mother or sister) aged under 65, who’s had CHD or stroke
a family history of a cholesterol-related condition – for example, having a parent, brother or sister with familial hypercholesterolaemia
age – the older you are, the greater the likelihood of your arteries narrowing (atherosclerosis)
ethnic group – people of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan descent are at increased risk of having a heart attack
sex – males are more likely to have heart attacks than females
If you have a fixed risk factor, or several fixed risk factors, it’s even more important to look at your lifestyle and any underlying conditions you may have.
Familial hypercholesterolaemia
Familial hypercholesterolaemia is the medical term for high cholesterol that runs in families. It’s caused by a gene alteration inherited from a parent, rather than an unhealthy lifestyle.
People with familial hypercholesterolaemia have raised cholesterol from birth, which can lead to the early development of heart problems, such as atherosclerosis and CHD.
In the UK, familial hypercholesterolaemia is thought to affect about 1 in 500 people, which means approximately 120,000 people are thought to be affected.
There’s a one in two (50%) chance that a child or brother or sister of someone with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also have the condition.
Read more about the importance of
early identification and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia
Diagnosing high cholesterol
Blood cholesterol levels are measured with a simple blood test.
Getting a cholesterol test
A blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL), good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and other fatty substances (triglycerides) in your blood.
You may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you’re asleep at night. This ensures that all food is completely digested and won’t affect the outcome of the test.
Your GP or practice nurse can carry out the cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger.
A newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) is now sometimes used because it’s thought to be a more accurate way of estimating
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk than LDL.
Non-HDL cholesterol is total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol. It’s also not necessary to fast before the test, so it is more convenient.
Who should be tested?
Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you:
have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease,
stroke
or
mini-stroke (TIA)
, or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
are over the age of 40 – people over 40 should have their estimate of CVD risk reviewed regularly
have a family history of early cardiovascular disease – for example, if your father or brother developed heart disease or had a
heart attack
or stroke before the age of 55, or if your mother or sister had these conditions before the age of 65
have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia
are overweight or obese
have high blood pressure or diabetes
have another medical condition, such as
kidney disease
, an
underactive thyroid
, or an
inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)
– these conditions can cause increased levels of cholesterol or triglycerides
Results
After your cholesterol test, your GP or nurse will explain your results and calculate whether you have a high, moderate or low risk of developing heart disease or stroke (cardiovascular disease) within the next 10 years.
However, this risk isn’t just based on your cholesterol reading. It also takes into account:
your BMI (body mass index) – which measures your weight in relation to your height
treatable risk factors – such as
high blood pressure (hypertension)
,
diabetes
and other medical conditions
your age, sex, family history and ethnicity
Based on your results, your GP or nurse will recommend steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing CVD.
This may include advice about making lifestyle changes, such as eating more healthily – by increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, for example – and doing more exercise.
Cholesterol-lowering medication, such as
statins
, may also be recommended.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia
People with familial hypercholesterolaemia, or inherited high cholesterol, are at increased risk of developing CVD.
In the UK, most of the 120,000 people thought to have the condition are undiagnosed and untreated.
As a result of the increased risk of developing CVD, it’s very important that those with familial hypercholesterolaemia are diagnosed as early as possible and offered appropriate treatment.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
recommends that adults with a total cholesterol level of above 7.5mmol/l before treatment should be assessed for familial hypercholesterolaemia.
If you’ve been diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolaemia, you’ll be referred for a specialist assessment, which may include DNA testing to confirm the diagnosis.
Appropriate treatment will be recommended and other members of your family who may be affected will also be tested.
You’ll be closely monitored, and should have a full review at least once a year to check how well your treatment is working and assess any symptoms you may have.
Children
Children at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia will be tested by the time they reach 10 years of age.
This is because any signs of CVD, such as thickening of the carotid artery wall, will be identifiable by this age.
The assessment will be carried out by a specialist with expertise in familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and young people.
Early diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia means it’s possible to recommend lifestyle changes and other appropriate treatments to reduce the long-term problems associated with high cholesterol and improve long-term health.
For further information, see the
NICE guidance about familial hypercholesterolaemia
Treating high cholesterol
If you’ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you’ll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise.
After a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn’t dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication.
Changing your diet,
stopping smoking
and exercising more will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing.
The various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below.
Diet
Eating a
healthy, balanced diet
that’s low in saturated fats can reduce your level of “bad cholesterol” (LDL).
Try to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat:
fatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies
butter, ghee and lard
cream, soured cream, crème fraîche and ice cream
cheese, particularly hard cheese
cakes and biscuits
milk chocolate
coconut oil, coconut cream and palm oil
The government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person’s food energy should come from saturated fat. This equates to no more than:
30g of saturated fat a day for the average man
20g of saturated fat a day for the average woman
Children should have less.
Check the labels on the foods you’re eating to find out how much saturated fat you’re consuming.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Many experts believe that the fats found in avocados and oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you.
These are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. However, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to
obesity
.
For people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. However, there’s no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit.
Cholesterol-lowering medication
There are several different types of cholesterol-lowering medication that work in different ways. Your GP can advise you about the most suitable type of treatment, and may also prescribe
medication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension)
if it affects you.
The most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below.
Statins
Statins
block the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. This leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level.
You’ll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. Other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin.
When someone has side effects from using a statin, it’s described as having an “intolerance” to it.
Side effects of statins
include
headaches
, muscle pain and stomach problems, such as
indigestion
, diarrhoea or
constipation
.
Statins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life. Cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them.
Aspirin
In some cases, a low daily dose of
aspirin
may be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors.
Low-dose aspirin can help to prevent
blood clots
forming, particularly for someone who’s had a
heart attack
, has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developing
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
.
You may also be advised to have periodic
blood tests
to ensure your liver is functioning well.
Ezetimibe
Ezetimibe is a medication that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food and bile juices in your intestines into your blood. It’s generally not as effective as statins, but is less likely to cause side effects.
You can take ezetimibe at the same time as your usual statin if your cholesterol levels aren’t low enough with the statin alone. The side effects of this combination are generally the same as those of the statin on its own (muscle pain and stomach problems).
You can take ezetimibe by itself if you’re unable to take a statin. This may be because you have another medical condition, you take medication that interferes with how the statin works, or because you experience side effects from statins. Ezetimibe taken on its own rarely causes side effects.
For more information, you can read the National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines about the use of
ezetimibe for treating high cholesterol
.
Preventing high cholesterol
You can lower your cholesterol by eating a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in saturated fat, exercising regularly, not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.
Diet
If you have an unhealthy diet that’s high in fat, fatty plaques are much more likely to build up in your arteries. This is because fatty foods contain cholesterol.
There are two types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid foods containing saturated fats, as they will increase the levels of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) in your blood.
Foods high in saturated fat include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter
ghee – a type of butter often used in Indian cooking
lard
cream
hard cheese
cakes and biscuits
food that contains coconut or palm oil
However, it’s not healthy to completely cut out all types of fat from your diet. It’s important to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats – they’ve been shown to increase levels of “good cholesterol” (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and reduce any blockage in your arteries.
Foods that are high in unsaturated fat include:
oily fish – such as mackerel, salmon and tuna
avocados
nuts and seeds
sunflower, rapeseed and olive oil
A low-fat diet including lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, and plenty of fruit and vegetables has also been shown to help lower cholesterol.
Fruit and vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and fibre, and help keep your body in good condition. Aim to eat
five 80g portions of fruit and vegetables every day
.
Smoking
A chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting fatty deposits to the liver, leading to high cholesterol and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This means smoking is a major risk factor for both heart attacks and
strokes
.
If you decide to stop smoking, your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will provide you with dedicated help and advice about the best ways to give up smoking.
You can also call
Quit Your Way Scotland
on 0800 84 84 84. The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.
If you’re committed to giving up smoking but don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.
Read more about
treatment for quitting smoking
Exercise
Being active and
exercising regularly
will increase the levels of HDL in your body by stimulating the body to move fatty deposits to the liver, so they can be broken down.
Exercise will also help you maintain a healthy weight, and lose weight if you’re overweight. Being overweight can increase the amount of “bad cholesterol” in your blood.
Another benefit of regular physical activity is it will help lower your blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.
Doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week is recommended to help lower your cholesterol.
Walking
,
swimming
and
cycling
are good examples of this type of exercise.

Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
What is Hodgkin lymphoma?
Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are 2 main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL.
The lymphatic system
The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease.
The lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. Lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but Hodgkin Lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. The other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. Glands can swell in these areas as part of the body’s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma.
The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50.
There are 2 main types of lymphoma:
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Although these are both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.
Causes
The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. In most people that develop Hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. However, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. Poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. Very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop Hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person.
Signs and symptoms
The first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of 1 gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on 1 side. However, it’s important to remember that children’s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways.
Sometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin.
How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed
As lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It’s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic.
If Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. These tests include X-rays, blood tests, CT, MRI and PET scans.
Very often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. This is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands.
The tests that are carried out are called staging tests. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.
Staging
The stage of Hodgkin lymphoma describes the size and position of the cancer and whether it has spread. Staging is very important because the type of treatment your child receives will depend on the stage of the disease. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is as follows:
stage 1 – only 1 group of lymph nodes is affected and the lymphoma is only on 1 side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs that controls breathing)
stage 2 – 2 or more groups of lymph nodes are affected, but they are only on 1 side of the diaphragm.
stage 3 – the lymphoma is in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm
stage 4 – the lymphoma has spread outside the lymph nodes to other organs such as the liver, lungs or bone marrow
As well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code – either A, B, or E:
A means your child has no symptoms
B means your child has 1 or more of the following symptoms: a fever, night sweats or significant weight loss
E means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes)
A number and letter is used in the staging of every child with Hodgkin lymphoma. This helps the doctor decide on a treatment plan for your child.
Treatment
Children with Hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. The type and amount of treatment given depend on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. Your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.
Chemotherapy
This is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.
It is usual for a combination of drugs to be used, which will often be given every few weeks over a number of months. A combination of drugs is used because each chemotherapy drug works in a different way. Using several drugs together increases the effectiveness of the treatment. It also means lower doses of individual drugs can be used, which may reduce the possibility of long-term side effects.
Radiotherapy
This is used in less than half of people with Hodgkin lymphoma. It treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used and the part of the body that is being treated.
Some general side effects of chemotherapy that can occur during treatment include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
hair loss
low blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding
tiredness
Changes to your child’s sense of taste and changes in their bowel may also happen. If your child has side effects from the treatment it is important to discuss them with your doctor or nurse. They may be able to help reduce them.
Late side effects of treatment
The cure rate for Hodgkin lymphoma is very high, which means some children may develop side effects many years after treatment. The chance of developing late side effects depends on where the original tumour was, how far it spread, and the type of treatment your child had.
These late side effects can affect the normal organs such as the heart, kidneys and lungs. Following treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, there is a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. There is also a chance that fertility may be affected. Teenage boys who are diagnosed after puberty should have the option of sperm banking before treatment starts. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.
Your child’s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version.
The aim of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is to cure the cancer with the fewest possible short and long-term side effects. This is particularly important in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma where cure rates are high. It’s important to get the balance right between curing the cancer and having the lowest risk of long-term side effects.
If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
About 90% of children who develop Hodgkin lymphoma are cured. When your child completes treatment, they will then go into a follow-up phase, seeing doctors and nurses in out-patient clinics usually for around five years. Clinic visits will be every 3 to 4 months to start with and there will be occasional scans, X-rays, and blood tests done for several years after completing treatment.
If the cancer comes back, a different course of treatment can be given. If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation.
Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL)
This is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. LPHL usually grows at a slower rate than classical Hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. Young people with LPHL may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. The swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. The biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease.
LPHL is usually treated with surgery or low-dose chemotherapy. It may return many years after treatment, and further treatment may be required, but it is rarely a life-threatening condition. In rare cases, patients have advanced LPHL and receive more intensive chemotherapy. There is also a link between LPHL and developing a more aggressive
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/hyperglycaemia-high-blood-sugar/,"Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) can affect people with
type 1 diabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes.
It can occasionally affect people who don’t have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a
stroke
or
heart attack
, or have a severe infection.
Hyperglycaemia shouldn’t be confused with
hypoglycaemia
, which is when a person’s blood sugar level drops too low.
This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes.
Is hyperglycaemia serious?
The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you’re likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point.
It’s important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.
Occasional mild episodes aren’t usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods.
Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as:
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes
hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) – severe
dehydration
caused by the body trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes
Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels.
If you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include:
increased
thirst
and a
dry mouth
needing to pee frequently
tiredness
blurred vision
unintentional weight loss
recurrent infections, such as thrush,
bladder infections (cystitis)
and skin infections
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition.
What should my blood sugar level be?
When you’re first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to.
You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is.
Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking:
if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal
if you’re tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale)
What causes high blood sugar?
A variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including:
stress
an illness, such as a
cold
eating too much, such as snacking between meals
a lack of exercise
dehydration
missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose
over-treating an episode of
hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)
taking certain medicines, such as
steroid medication
Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts.
Treating hyperglycaemia
If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level.
If you’re not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team.
You may be advised to:
change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks
drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you’re dehydrated
exercise more often – gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight
if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this
You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).
Until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below).
When to get urgent medical attention
Contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms:
feeling or being sick
abdominal (tummy) pain
rapid, deep breathing
signs of dehydration
, such as a
headache
, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat
difficulty staying awake
These symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital.
How to prevent hyperglycaemia
There are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia:
Be careful what you eat – be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level.
Stick to your treatment plan – remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team.
Be as active as possible – getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you’re taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much
Take extra care when you’re ill – your care team can provide you with some “sick day rules” that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness.
Monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/inherited-heart-conditions/,"Inherited heart conditions
An inherited heart disease is one which has been passed on through your parents’ genes.
Inherited cardiac conditions (ICC) is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of relatively rare diseases of the heart. They are also referred to as genetic cardiac conditions.
ICCs are caused by a fault – also known as a mutation – in one or more of our genes. If someone has a faulty gene, there’s a 50/50 chance it can be passed on to your children.
The effects of these conditions on you and your family can be enormous. These conditions can – in some cases – become life-threatening. Around 500 young people die every year in the UK as a result of a genetic heart disorder.
These conditions do not always have symptoms, so you can be unaware you have the conditions. Sadly, this can sometimes mean that the first time a family is aware of being affected is after a sudden cardiac death (SCD).
However, great improvements are being made in the detection of ICCs and also how you can live with your condition. There are effective treatments which allow you to lead a normal life.
Family history
It’s very important to draw a medical family tree with an appropriate health professional. This can help to “paint a picture” to see if you have – or have had – any other family members with the same condition. The family tree is sometimes known as a pedigree.
Signs and symptoms
Sometimes people don’t experience many signs and symptoms, but the main symptoms of familial arrhythmia are:
palpitations
fainting or blackouts (also known as syncope or “near” faint)
The majority of children and young adults with syncope have a normal heart disease and no major heart rhythm problem.
However, it’s really important to speak to your GP or health professional if you – or a member of your family – have suffered unexplained fainting, especially if it’s happened more than once.
Different inherited heart conditions
Familial cardiomyopathies
These include:
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
idiopathic or familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
restrictive cardiomyopathy
Familial arrhythmias
These include:
Long QT syndrome (LQTS)
Brugada syndrome
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)
Short QT Syndrome (SQTS)
Marfan syndrome
Marfan syndrome is an inherited – or genetic – condition that affects the body’s connective tissues. Connective tissues provide support and structure to other tissue and organs.
There is a 50/50 chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will have a child with the condition, but Marfan syndrome is relatively rare – around 1 in 5,000 people have the syndrome.
You can get more information from
Marfan Foundation
Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome (SADS)
This is a condition which means there was an unexplained underlying familial heart rhythm that was not detected until there was an investigation following a death.
British Heart Foundation

heart transplantation (in rare cases) – see
heart surgery
See our section on

Sport
Sport and physical activity have many benefits. However, vigorous levels of exercise can be dangerous for people with inherited cardiac conditions. Research is, at present, still exploring what level of activity is right for the individual affected by an inherited cardiac condition, especially if they’re a young person.
If you want to find out more, speak to your cardiologist.

section for general advice on various aspects of living with a heart condition, like benefits, driving and going on holiday.
Support
Living with an inherited cardiac condition can be distressing for both those with the condition and their families. There is support available through psychological help and genetic counselling.
Genetic services in Scotland are managed by specialist hospital doctors in four regional centres:
Aberdeen – phone 01224 552120
Dundee – phone 01382 632330
Edinburgh – phone 0131 537 1116
Glasgow – phone 0141 354 9235
These regional services have access to:
specialist cardiologists
geneticists
specialist nursing
genetic counselling
These cardiac-genetic services link with the smaller hospitals in their regions.
Genetic testing is done for arrhythmias in Aberdeen and for cardiomyopathies in Edinburgh.
You may need to visit your family doctor to obtain a referral to a specialist service.
Network for Inherited Cardiac Conditions Scotland (NICCS)
NICCS is a National Managed Clinical Network (NMCN). It was set up to help coordinate services for people with – or suspected of having – inherited cardiac conditions.
It’s part of the NHS and aims to improve services for inherited cardiac conditions (ICCs).
The NICCS brings together experts from across Scotland. Those in the network include:
heart specialists

About hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively.
The sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas. Commonly affected areas include the:
armpits
palms of your hands
soles of your feet
face and chest
groin
Both sides of the body are usually affected equally – for example, both feet or both hands.
The sweating doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to feelings of
depression
and
anxiety
.

What is excessive sweating?
There are no guidelines to determine what “normal” sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis.
For example, you may have hyperhidrosis if:
you avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands, because you feel self-conscious about your sweating
you don’t take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse
excessive sweating is interfering with your job – for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard
you’re having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving
you’re spending a significant amount of time coping with sweating – for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes
you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious
When to see your GP
Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively.
Many people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it. But treatment is available.
Also visit your GP if you are having night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious.
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to check for an underlying cause (see below).
What causes hyperhidrosis?
In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis.
Hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including:
pregnancy or the
menopause
anxiety
certain medications
low blood sugar (
hypoglycaemia
)
an overactive thyroid gland (
hyperthyroidism
)
infections

causes of hyperhidrosis

How hyperhidrosis is treated
Excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.
Doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants. Lifestyle changes may also help, including:
wearing loose and light clothes
avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse
wearing black or white clothes to help minimise the signs of sweating
If this doesn’t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases.
Hyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control.

Who is affected
Hyperhidrosis is common. It’s been estimated to affect between 1 and 3 in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK.
Hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.
Causes of hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis can be divided into 2 types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis.
Primary hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis.
Although it’s not clear why it develops, it’s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it’s possible your genes may also play a role.
The sympathetic nervous system
The sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body’s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder.
The sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body.
A specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis.
It’s thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body.
Genes
Some cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause.
A genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children.
Secondary hyperhidrosis
If a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it’s known as secondary hyperhidrosis.
Secondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including:
pregnancy
the
menopause
– when a woman’s monthly periods stop
anxiety
low blood sugar (
hypoglycaemia
)
an overactive thyroid gland (
hyperthyroidism
)
obesity
certain medications – including some
antidepressants
, propranolol, pilocarpine, and bethanechol
being drunk or “high” on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you have become addicted to them
some infections, such as
tuberculosis
and
HIV
Parkinson’s disease
disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as
Hodgkin lymphoma
(a cancer of the white blood cells)
Secondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body.
Treating hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. Less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first.
Lifestyle changes
Changing your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence.
The advice below may help.
Avoid triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol
Use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant
Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon
Wearing black or white clothing can minimise signs of sweating
Armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes
Wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture
Avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible
Ideally wear shoes made of leather, and try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day
Stronger antiperspirants
If a regular antiperspirant doesn’t control your sweating, your GP may prescribe or suggest a stronger one for you.
Antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning.
The most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.
Anticholinergics
You may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands.
Anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They’re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful.
Propantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. However, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis – such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide – can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help.
Possible side effects of anticholinergics include a
dry mouth
, blurred vision, stomach cramps,
constipation
and difficulty passing urine.
Referral to a dermatologist
If lifestyle changes and treatment don’t work, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery.
Iontophoresis
Iontophoresis may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective.
Iontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. This is thought to help block the sweat glands.
If your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. If your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad.
The treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation.
Each session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2 to 4 sessions a week. Your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1 to 4 week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are.
Iontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital’s dermatology clinic to receive treatment.
Alternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of £250-500.
Botulinum toxin injections
Botulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands.
Around 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total.
The effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.
Potential side effects of botulinum toxin injections include:
pain, redness or itching where the injections are given
nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given
another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area – known as compensatory sweating
muscle weakness around the treatment area
Most of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off.
Availability of botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (CCG), and you may only be able to get it privately. Costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. For example, injecting the forehead can cost around £150, while treating both armpits could cost up to £450 or more.
Surgery and other procedures
In a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment hasn’t been successful, surgery may be recommended.
Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS)
Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It’s usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits.
Small incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under
general anaesthetic
and done on both sides of the body.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain:
ETS carries a risk of serious complications (see below)
it’s very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure
the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating
For this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn’t responded to treatment should be considered.
Read the full
NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb
.
Side effects and complications of ETS can also include:
sweating of the face and neck after eating food – this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure
bleeding into the chest during surgery
air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties
damage to the nervous system that causes the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (Horner’s syndrome) – this may be permanent
Removing or destroying sweat glands
Excessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits.
This can be carried out in a number of ways:
making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley’s procedure) the sweat glands
using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands
inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands
These procedures are generally carried out under
local anaesthetic
, which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed.
These procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. Availability on the NHS is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment.
These procedures don’t work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn’t always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness.
Treating anxiety
Feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle.
You may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse.
If your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) might help. Medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.
Complications of hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems.
Fungal infections
Hyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly on the feet – most commonly
fungal nail infections
and athlete’s foot. This is because excessive sweat combined with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow.
Fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. More severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules.
Skin conditions
Excessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to certain skin conditions, such as:
warts
– small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the HPV virus
boils – swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infected
Eczema
can also be made worse by excessive sweating.
Body odour
Although people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don’t have problems with body odour. This is because hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat – called the aprocrine sweat glands.
However, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. Eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell.
This can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat.
See
treating hyperhidrosis
for more information.
Emotional impact
The emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. Many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. Signs that you may be depressed include:
feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month
having little interest or pleasure in things during the past month
It is important not to neglect your mental health. Make an appointment to see your GP if you think that you may be depressed.

About impetigo
Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It’s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment.
Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages.
Symptoms of impetigo
There are 2 types of impetigo:
non-bullous impetigo – the most common type
bullous impetigo
Non-bullous impetigo
The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.
The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.
After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.
The sores aren’t painful, but they may be itchy. It’s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people.
Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and
swollen glands
, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.
Bullous impetigo
The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.
The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.
The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it’s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.
Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.
When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Impetigo treatment from your local pharmacy
Adults and children over 2 years with impetigo can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Impetigo isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.
Causes of impetigo
Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
The bacteria can infect the skin in 2 main ways:
through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a
cut
,
insect bite
or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo
through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as
head lice
,
scabies
or
eczema
– this is known as secondary impetigo
The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.
As the condition doesn’t cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it’s often easily spread to others unintentionally.
Children and people with
diabetes
or a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such as
HIV
or a treatment such as
chemotherapy
– are most at risk of developing impetigo.
Treating impetigo
Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around 2 to 3 weeks.
However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others.
The main treatments prescribed are
antibiotic
creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week.
Read about
treating impetigo
.
Preventing the spread of impetigo
During treatment, it’s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body.
Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It’s important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point.
The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection:
do not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use
wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing
avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short
avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed
wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin
washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely
If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they’re seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible.
Preventing recurrent impetigo
To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.
If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby.
If you’re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.
Complications of impetigo
Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.
Some complications associated with impetigo include:
cellulitis
– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue
scarlet fever
– a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body
guttate
psoriasis
– a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection
septicaemia (a type of
sepsis
) – a bacterial infection of the blood
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys
In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores
Symptoms of impetigo
Impetigo does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after you first become infected. This means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it.
There are 2 main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. Most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type.
Non-bullous impetigo
The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.
The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.
After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.
The sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. It is important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people.
Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and
swollen glands
, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.
Bullous impetigo
The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.
The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.
The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.
Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.
Causes of impetigo
Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
These bacteria can infect the skin in 2 ways:
through a break in otherwise healthy skin, such as a cut,
insect bite
or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo
through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as
head lice
,
scabies
or
eczema
– this is known as secondary impetigo
The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.
As the condition does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it is often easily spread to others unintentionally.
Impetigo stops being infectious after 48 hours of treatment starting or after the sores have stopped blistering or crusting.
Increased risk
In addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. These include:
being a child – impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries
having
diabetes
being a carrier of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria – these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby
warm and humid weather – impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the UK, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year
having a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such as
HIV
or a treatment such as
chemotherapy
Treating impetigo
Impetigo isn’t usually serious and often clears up without treatment after 2 to 3 weeks.
Treatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around 7 to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others.
If impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with
antibiotics
.
If the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as
eczema
, this may also need to be treated.
Antibiotic cream
For mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied 3 or 4 times a day for 7 days.
Before applying the cream, wash any affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed.
To reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it’s also important that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream.
Side effects of antibiotic cream can include:
irritation
redness
itchiness in the area where the cream is applied
If symptoms haven’t improved after seven days of starting treatment, ask your pharmacist about other possible treatment options.
Antibiotic tablets
Antibiotic tablets may be prescribed if the infection is more severe and widespread, or if the symptoms don’t improve after using antibiotic cream. These usually need to be taken 2 to 4 times a day for 7 days.
If a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it’s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you’ve taken all the tablets.
Common side effects of oral antibiotics include:
feeling sick
vomiting
diarrhoea
Speak to your pharmacist if your symptoms haven’t improved after 7 days of treatment with antibiotic tablets.
Further testing and treatment
Further tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn’t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring.
In these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab of the affected skin themselves for testing.
This can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the infection inside your nose.
If your doctor thinks you may keep getting impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.
Complications of impetigo
Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.
Cellulitis
Cellulitis
occurs when the infection spreads to a deeper layer of skin. It can cause symptoms of red, inflamed skin with fever and pain. It can usually be treated with antibiotics, and painkillers can be used to relieve pain.
Guttate psoriasis
Guttate
psoriasis
is a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. It is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo.
Guttate psoriasis causes small, red, droplet-shaped, scaly patches on the chest, arms, legs and scalp.
Creams can be used to control the symptoms and in some cases the condition will disappear completely after a few weeks.
Scarlet fever
Scarlet fever
is a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body. Associated symptoms of infection, such as nausea, pain and vomiting, are also common. The condition is usually treated with antibiotics.
Scarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. Therefore, it’s important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. Keep your child away from school and other people until they have been taking antibiotics for at least 24 hours.
Septicaemia
Septicaemia (a type of
sepsis
) is a bacterial infection of the blood. It can cause:
diarrhoea
cold, clammy skin
a high temperature (fever)
rapid breathing
vomiting
low blood pressure
(hypotension)
confusion
feeling faint and dizzy
losing consciousness
Septicaemia is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics in hospital.
Scarring
In rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. However, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. The
blisters
and crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal.
The red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a serious skin condition in which one of the causes of impetigo – Staphylococcus bacteria – releases a toxin (poison) that damages the skin.
This leads to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water.
Other symptoms of SSSS include:
painful skin
a high temperature (fever)
large areas of skin peeling off or falling away
redness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire body
SSSS usually requires immediate treatment in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. It’s a very rare complication of impetigo.
The symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include:
a change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour
swelling of the abdomen (tummy), face, eyes, feet and ankles
a rise in blood pressure
visible blood in your urine
a reduction in the amount of urine you would normally produce
People with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will usually require immediate hospital treatment so their blood pressure can be carefully monitored and controlled.
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare.
Preventing impetigo
As impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.
Stopping the infection spreading
To help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body you should:
stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until the sores have dried up, blistered or crusted over, or until 48 hours after starting treatment
not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use
wash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible
avoid touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible
not scratch the affected areas – it may help to ensure your or your child’s nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching
avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym until the risk of infection has passed (when the rash has crusted over, or after at least 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics)
wash your hands frequently, particularly after touching infected skin
washable toys should also be washed, and wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely
If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they contact their pharmacist as soon as possible.
Preventing re-infection
To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean, and ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.
If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria inside your nose. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infected broken skin nearby.
If you are found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring."

About indigestion
Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn).
Dyspepsia and
heartburn
may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking.
Common associated symptoms include:
feeling full or bloated
feeling sick (nausea)
belching
bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus)
Indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it’s mild and only occurs occasionally.
Read more about the
symptoms of indigestion
.
Why it happens
Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful.
The majority of people with indigestion don’t have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching).
In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications.
Read more about the
causes of indigestion
.
Treating indigestion at home
Most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids.
Read more about the
treatment of indigestion
.
Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required.
When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Indigestion treatment from your pharmacy
If you have symptoms of indigestion you can get treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply:
you are 55 years old or over
you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to
you have increasing
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
you have persistent vomiting
you have
iron deficiency anaemia
you have a lump in your stomach
you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stools
This is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a
stomach ulcer
or
stomach cancer
. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause.
An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end).
Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. Read more about the possible
complications of severe indigestion
.
Symptoms of indigestion
The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.
These symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.
Heartburn
is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).
If you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:
feeling uncomfortably full or heavy
belching or
flatulence
(passing wind)
bringing food or fluid back up from your stomach (reflux)
bloating
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting
Causes of indigestion
Indigestion has a number of different causes, but it’s rarely due to a serious, underlying condition.
It’s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus).
This irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the ‘stretching’ caused by eating.
Indigestion can also be triggered or made worse by other factors.
Medications
You may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up.
Other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (
NSAIDs
), can affect your digestive tract and cause indigestion.
Do not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a
stomach ulcer
, or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin.
Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.
Obesity
If you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).
The increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus.
Stress or anxiety
If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.
Read some relaxation tips to relieve stress.
Hiatus hernia
A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall.
A
hiatus hernia
occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs). It may partially block refluxed stomach acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn.
Helicobacter pylori infection
Helicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it does not cause any symptoms at all.
Some people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms.
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It’s caused by acid reflux, which occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus.
A little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing.
Stomach ulcers
A
stomach ulcer
is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom.
Stomach ulcers form when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection.
Stomach cancer
In rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of
stomach cancer
.
Cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.
Diagnosing indigestion
For most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional.
However, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist.
They will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as:
any other symptoms you have – which may indicate an underlying health condition
any medication you are taking – as some medications can cause indigestion
your lifestyle – as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion
Depending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your GP to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection.
Further investigations
Endoscopy
You may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy.
An endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a TV monitor.
An endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if:
they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail
you have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked
you have any
serious symptoms of indigestion
Taking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists.

Your GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.
Diagnosing H pylori infection
If your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as:
a stool antigen test – a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria
a breath test
a
blood test
– a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection)
Antibiotics
and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and 4 weeks after you last used an antibiotic.
Diagnosing other conditions
If your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out.
For example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working.
You may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An
ultrasound scan
uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.
Treating indigestion
Treatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are.
If you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on:

Diet and lifestyle changes
If you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below.
Healthy weight
Being overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion.
If you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on
losing weight
.
Stop smoking
If you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux.
Read more about
quitting smoking
, or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also phone the
Quit Your Way Scotland
service on 0800 84 84 84.
Diet and alcohol
Make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean:
eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods
cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine – such as tea, coffee and cola
avoiding or cutting down on alcohol
At bedtime
If you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down.
When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally, raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep.
Stress or anxiety
If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.
Read some
relaxation tips to relieve stress
.
Changing current medication
Your pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion.
As long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first.
Immediate indigestion relief
If you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend:
antacid medicines
alginates
Antacids
Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system.
Antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription.
The effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much.
It is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as:
after meals
at bedtime
This is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes.
Read more about antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects.
Alginates
Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux.
Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus.
Your pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD.
Take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective.
Treating persistent indigestion
If you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include:
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
H2-receptor antagonists
Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see
Indigestion – diagnosis
) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
PPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach.
The medication is taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as:
warfarin – a medicine that stops the blood clotting
phenytoin – a medicine to treat epilepsy
If your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP.
If your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.
PPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include:
headaches
diarrhoea
constipation
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting
flatulence
stomach pain
dizziness
skin rashes
H2-receptor antagonists
H2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists:
cimetidine
famotidine
nizatidine
ranitidine
These medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach.
Your GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form.
As with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP. This is because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection
If your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach.
H pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing:
two different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria)
a PPI
You will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective.
In up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.
Complications of indigestion
In most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. However, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below.
Oesophageal stricture
Indigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. If this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. The scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture).
If you have oesophageal stricture, you may have symptoms such as:
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
food that becomes lodged in your throat
chest pain
Oesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus.
Pyloric stenosis
Like oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid.
Pyloric stenosis occurs when the passage between your stomach and your small intestine (known as the pylorus) becomes scarred and narrowed. This causes vomiting and prevents any food you eat from being properly digested.
In most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width.
Barrett’s oesophagus
Repeated episodes of
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus.
It is estimated that 1 in 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett’s oesophagus. Most cases of Barrett’s oesophagus first develop in people aged 50 to 70 years old. The average age at diagnosis is 62.
Barrett’s oesophagus does not usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those associated with GORD.
The concern is that Barrett’s oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. This means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into cancer in the future. This would then trigger the onset of
oesophageal cancer

Introduction
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia
Causes of hypoglycaemia
Treating hypoglycaemia
Preventing hypoglycaemia
Introduction
Hypoglycaemia, or a “hypo”, is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre).
When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn’t have enough energy to carry out its activities.
Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with
diabetes
, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard.
In rare cases, it’s possible for a person who doesn’t have diabetes to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by
malnutrition
, binge drinking or certain conditions, such as
Addison’s disease
.
Read more about the
causes of hypoglycaemia
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia
Most people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.
Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.
It’s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.
Read more about the
symptoms of hypoglycaemia
Correcting hypoglycaemia
The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels.
After having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting “starchy” carbohydrate food, such as a sandwich or a few biscuits.
If hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness. This is only if an injection is available and the person giving the injection knows how to use it.
You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if:
a glucagon injection kit isn’t available
there’s nobody trained to give the injection
the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes
Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s drowsy or unconscious as they could choke. This includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek.
Read more about
treating hypoglycaemia
Preventing hypoglycaemia
If you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, the safest way to avoid hypoglycaemia is to regularly check your blood sugar and learn to recognise the early symptoms.
Missing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. You should be careful when drinking
alcohol
as it can also cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking.
Exercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose.
You should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it’s injected.
Always carry rapid-acting carbohydrate with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low.
Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency.
When hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo.
Read more about
preventing hypoglycaemia
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.
If you have
diabetes
, particularly if it’s treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to regularly check your blood glucose levels.
Symptoms can vary from person to person, and it’s important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them.
Signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include:
feeling hungry
sweating
dizziness
tiredness (fatigue)
blurred vision
trembling or shakiness
going pale
fast pulse or
palpitations
tingling lips
irritability
difficulty concentrating
confusion
disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness
If hypoglycaemia isn’t treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness.
Most people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition.
For some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they’re dependent on others for help.
Let your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk.
Read more about
how hypoglycaemia is treated
Hypoglycaemia while sleeping
Having a hypo while you’re asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It’s more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin.
Although some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning.
The symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include:
headache
– often likened to having a hangover
feeling unusually tired in the morning
damp sheets or clothing from sweating
Causes of hypoglycaemia
In most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people with
diabetes
, although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions.
Hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes
Overdose of diabetes medication
A common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. Insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. It’s commonly used to treat
type 1 diabetes
and is also recommended for some people with
type 2 diabetes
.
A fall in blood glucose levels can also occur after taking too much oral hypoglycaemia medication, such as sulphonylurea, which causes a release of insulin. This medication is often used to lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.
Exercise, food and alcohol
For people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing how much insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise.
Hypoglycaemia may occur if you’ve taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. This may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don’t eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual.
People with diabetes who’ve drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia.
However, it’s not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason.
Hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes
Hypoglycaemia – even mild cases – is very rare in people who don’t have diabetes. The possible causes are outlined below.
Reactive hypoglycaemia
People without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. This is known as reactive hypoglycaemia.
It’s not clear why this happens, although it’s thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery.
In rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose.
Other possible causes
Other possible causes of hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes are:
fasting or
malnutrition
– where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly
binge drinking or heavy drinking of alcohol
Addison’s disease
– a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys)
certain medication – hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (for
malaria
), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (for
high blood pressure
)
severe illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid gland
Treating hypoglycaemia
In most cases, you can treat hypoglycaemia yourself when you recognise the symptoms.
Treating an episode of hypoglycaemia
The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some sugary food or drink (about 15 to 20g of rapidly acting carbohydrate) to end the attack.
For example, this could be:
a glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink
between three and five dextrose tablets
a handful of sweets
At first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don’t usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly.
After having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich.
It will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. If it’s still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing your levels again in another 15 to 20 minutes.
When treating someone else with hypoglycaemia, if the above treatment isn’t effective, you may be able to help them by applying glucose gel (or honey, treacle or jam if glucose gel isn’t available) to the inside of their cheeks, and gently massaging the outside of their cheeks.
It may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. This shouldn’t be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking.
If you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. Your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated.
If a person is unconscious
If a person loses consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into the
recovery position
and given an injection of the hormone glucagon (if they have an injection kit). The injection will raise their blood glucose level.
The injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they’re doing, or by a trained healthcare professional.
You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if:
a glucagon injection kit isn’t available
there’s nobody available who’s trained to give the injection
the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes
Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s unconscious as they could choke.
If you’re able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich.
You should continue to monitor the person for signs of recurring symptoms in case they need to be treated again.
Preventing hypoglycaemia
If you have diabetes, sticking to your medication plan and eating regular meals can help prevent hypoglycaemia.
It’s also important to monitor your blood glucose levels.
Monitoring blood glucose
Regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels can help you keep your blood glucose as normal and stable as possible, and will help you spot the
signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia
quickly.
Your blood glucose level can vary throughout the day, so you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you’re taking.
You can monitor your blood glucose levels using a blood glucose meter, a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood.
Read more about
living with type 1 diabetes
and
living with type 2 diabetes
Food and alcohol
If you have diabetes, strenuous physical activity can lead to hypoglycaemia. Eating extra carbohydrate-based foods before and during exercise can help reduce the chances of this happening.
If you’re taking insulin, your doctor may advise you to lower your dose before you do strenuous physical activity.
Alcohol can also affect your body’s ability to release glucose. If you have
type 1 diabetes
, it’s recommended that you drink no more than 2 to 3
units of alcohol
a day and eat a snack after drinking alcohol.
Spotting the signs
As hypoglycaemia can develop suddenly, it’s important to be aware of the
symptoms of hypoglycaemia
so you can treat it quickly. Tell your family and friends about the signs to look out for and let them know how to treat it.
People with
diabetes
are advised to carry a form of identification with them that states their condition so they can be helped quickly and efficiently.
Keep treatment with you
If you’re at risk of hypoglycaemia, you should carry sugary food and drink with you at all times to treat mild cases as soon as possible.
If you have diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, your doctor may recommend medications such as glucose gel to carry with you. This can be used to treat hypoglycaemia that doesn’t respond to normal treatment.
If you’re being treated with insulin, you’ll usually be given a kit that contains an injection of a medication called glucagon. Family members or your carer can be trained to carry out the injection, which should be used if you lose consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia.
Preventing hypoglycaemia at night
It’s important to avoid recurrent hypoglycaemia during the night (nocturnal hypoglycaemia) as it can reduce the early symptoms of daytime episodes.
If you experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you can try:
keeping something sugary by your bedside
having a snack before bedtime, such as biscuits and milk
checking your blood glucose levels between 3am and 4am, when hypoglycaemia is most likely to occur
Hypoglycaemia and driving
As hypoglycaemia can cause confusion, drowsiness, or even unconsciousness, this can present a significant risk to you or other road users.
If you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, you must:
inform the DVLA and your insurance company
test your blood sugar before driving and at regular intervals (at least every two hours) while driving
avoid driving if your blood glucose is low
avoid driving for 45 minutes after treating hypoglycaemia
carry rapid-acting carbohydrates with you in the vehicle at all times
If you experience hypoglycaemia while driving, pull over and stop as soon as it’s safe to do so. Remove the keys from the ignition and get out of the driver’s seat before
treating hypoglycaemia
in the normal way.
If you have two or more episodes of hypoglycaemia that require assistance in a 12-month period, it’s a legal requirement to stop driving and inform the DVLA.
If you’re a group two driver (you hold a licence to drive buses, coaches or lorries), you’re legally required to stop driving group two vehicles immediately and inform the DVLA if you have a single episode of hypoglycaemia that requires assistance.
Inform your diabetes care team if you start having problems recognising hypoglycaemia or you start to have more regular episodes, even if there were warning symptoms and you were able to treat them without assistance.

About kidney cancer
Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK.
Signs and symptoms of kidney cancer can include:
blood in your urine
a constant pain in your side, just below the ribs
a lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body)
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests.
In around half of all cases of kidney cancer, there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions.
Read more about the
symptoms of kidney cancer
and
diagnosing kidney cancer
.
The kidneys and cancer
The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage.
Their main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only 1 of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.
The human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they’re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.
Exactly what triggers this growth is unknown. However, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as
smoking
and
obesity
.
Kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.
Read more about the
causes of kidney cancer
.
Types of kidney cancer
Many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for more than 80% of all kidney cancers.
Rarer types of kidney cancer include:
transitional cell cancer – develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over
Wilms’ tumour – a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children
This topic focuses on RCC. Read the Cancer Research UK website for more information about
transitional cell cancer
and
Wilms’ tumour
.
Treating kidney cancer
The earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.
How it’s treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action.
Unlike most other cancers,
chemotherapy
isn’t very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as
radiotherapy
or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.
Read more about
treating kidney cancer
.
Preventing kidney cancer
As the causes of kidney cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to fully prevent it.
However, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a
healthy diet
and
regular exercise
will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.
If you’re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet.
Read more about
treating obesity
.
Symptoms of kidney cancer
Most cases of kidney cancer don’t cause any symptoms in the early stages.
The most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are:
blood in your urine (haematuria) – the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour
a persistent pain in your side, just below the ribs
a lump or swelling in the area of your kidneys (on either side of the body)
However, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine
ultrasound scan
.
Less common symptoms of kidney cancer include:
extreme tiredness (fatigue) or
anaemia
unintentional weight loss
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
night sweats
a general sense of feeling unwell
swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men)
loss of appetite
high blood pressure (hypertension)
When to seek medical advice
Speak to your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).
You should also speak to your GP if you have blood in your urine. Although it’s highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could be a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a
kidney stone
or bladder stone.
Causes and risk factors of kidney cancer
The exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition.
The 3 main risk factors for kidney cancer are:
obesity
smoking
family history and genetics
Obesity
Obesity is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.
There’s a strong link between someone’s body mass index (BMI) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. Read more about
how BMI is calculated
, and work out your BMI.
A BMI score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person’s chances of developing kidney cancer. Those with a BMI score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk.
This may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. It’s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells.
Cases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.
Smoking
Smoking is also a significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk.
For example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you’re one-and-a-half times more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. This increases to twice as likely if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day.
It’s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.
Family history and genetics
If you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who’s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you’re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself.
Examples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include:
tuberous sclerosis – a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it’s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about 1 in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer
hereditary papillary kidney cancer – a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it’s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread
hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) – a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with HLRCC have a 10 to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome – a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; VHL is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome – an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torso
Other possible risk factors
There are also a number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including:
mild painkillers – some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer;
NSAIDs
, such as
ibuprofen
, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful
kidney disease
– if you have kidney failure and need to have regular
dialysis
(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased
high blood pressure (hypertension)
– high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you’re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure
Diagnosing kidney cancer
In many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn’t always have obvious symptoms.
You should speak to your GP if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer, such as blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs.
Your GP will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary tract).
If you notice blood in your urine, your GP will usually carry out a
blood test
and take a urine sample. The results will help rule out other possible causes, such as infection or
kidney stones
.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of renal (kidney) cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected kidney cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
If you need to be referred urgently, you’ll usually be seen within 2 weeks.
Further tests
If your GP refers you to a hospital specialist, further tests will help determine whether you have kidney cancer.
Ultrasound scan
An
ultrasound scan
uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be caused by a cancerous tumour.
An ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can’t be found.
Computerised tomography scan
You may also be referred for a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
. During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer.
If you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer.
Image-guided biopsy
In some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided
biopsy
is carried out. It’s a minor surgical procedure performed under
local anaesthetic
. This means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but the area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don’t feel anything.
During an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
You may also need to have a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
, which can be used to produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine its size.
Cystoscopy
A cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the inside of your bladder and urinary system.
This procedure doesn’t look at the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder.
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)
An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.
X-rays
are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys.
Staging and grading
If kidney cancer is confirmed, it’s usually possible to determine its grade and stage.
The stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it’s likely to spread.
Both the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure.
Healthcare professionals use the TNM system to stage kidney cancer:
T – indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue)
N – indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection)
M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread)
The stages of tumour size are:
T1a – where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches) in diameter
T1b – where the tumour is 4 to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter
T2 – where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches) in diameter, but hasn’t spread out of the kidney
T3a – where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney
T3b – where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body)
T3c – where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part)
T4 – where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney
There are 3 lymph node stages:
N0 – where no lymph nodes have been affected
N1 – where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node
N2 – where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodes
M0 means that the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread.
Kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.
Coping with cancer
Being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it’s incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend.
After cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with feelings of
depression
and
anxiety
.
Antidepressants
may also be used to help you through this process.

Treating kidney cancer
The treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells.
Unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn’t very effective in treating kidney cancer. However, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies.
The main treatments for kidney cancer include:
nephrectomy
embolisation
radiotherapy
targeted therapies
immunotherapy
Your treatment plan
You can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and
chemotherapy
), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse.
You’ll be given a key worker, usually the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care.
Your team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:
the
stage and grade of your cancer
(how big it is and how far it’s spread)
your age and general health
If the cancer hasn’t spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney.
If the cancer has spread out of your kidney (T3 or T4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. However, it should be possible to slow the cancer’s progression and treat any symptoms.
Surgical treatments
Nephrectomy
A nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney.
If the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health.
If the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed.
Removing the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective.
It’s possible to live a normal life with only 1 kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate.
During a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the kidney.
There are 2 ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an:
open nephrectomy – where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach)
laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy – where a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments
Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages.
A laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy.
However, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you decided to have an open nephrectomy.
Some types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy.
One of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it’s a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell.
You should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team.
Embolisation
If you’re unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative operation known as embolisation.
During embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use
X-ray
images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney.
By blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink.
Non-surgical treatments for advanced kidney cancer
Kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that’s less responsive to
chemotherapy
(where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells).
However, a number of clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people.
There are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
can’t usually cure kidney cancer, but it can slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days.
When radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. Possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting.
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be used if a person isn’t fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small.
Cryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision).
Side effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).
Radiofrequency ablation
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. This is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed.
This treatment is only available at specialist centres. It’s mainly used if you’re not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages.
RFA can’t be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel.
Side effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).
Targeted therapies
A number of new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. These are:
sunitinib
pazopanib
axitinib
sorafenib
temsirolimus
everolimus
bevacizumab
These medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they’re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread.
At present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib have been recommended by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
. They’re available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that’s spread to other parts of their body.
Sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren’t currently recommended by NICE.
Sunitinib
Sunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. It’s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. Sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing.
Sunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. You take it once a day for 4 weeks before having a 2-week break. This 6-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective.
It’s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that’s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist.
Common side effects of sunitinib include:
nausea
diarrhoea
high blood pressure (hypertension)
hair discolouration
mouth soreness
skin discolouration
skin rashes or blisters
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about
sunitinib and its side effects
.
Pazopanib
Like sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow.
Pazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. It’s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you.
Common side effects of pazopanib include:
nausea
diarrhoea
high blood pressure
hair discolouration
abnormal liver function
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
pazopanib
.
Axitinib
Axitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven’t been effective.
Like sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing.
Axitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after 2 weeks. It’s very important that you take the exact dose that’s been prescribed for you.
Common side effects of axitinib include:
diarrhoea
nausea and vomiting
loss of appetite
tiredness
a decrease in thyroid hormone level (
hypothyroidism
)
headaches
weight loss
loss of fertility
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
axitinib
.
Sorafenib
Sorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow.
Sorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective.
Again, it’s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you.
Common side effects of sorafenib include:
diarrhoea
fatigue
nausea and vomiting
hair thinning (in around one in four people)
increased risk of bleeding – such as
nosebleeds
or bleeding gums
loss of fertility
flushed skin
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
sorafenib.
Temsirolimus
Temsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It’s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that’s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow.
Temsirolimus is a liquid that’s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that’s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). The treatment takes 30 to 60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. Before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction.
Common side effects of temsirolimus include:
red, dry, itchy skin
nausea and vomiting
lack of appetite
diarrhoea
a sore mouth or
mouth ulcers
sleeping problems
loss of fertility
Everolimus
Everolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that’s returned during or following treatment. It stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. Everolimus prevents the mTOR protein from working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells.
Everolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It’s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed.
Common side effects of everolimus include:
a sore mouth
tiredness
a rash or itchy, dry skin
loss of appetite
nausea and vomiting
a lack of periods in women (this may be temporary)
loss of fertility
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
everolimus
.
Immunotherapy
As well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mTOR inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. This type of treatment is known as immunotherapy.
Bevacizumab is a medication that’s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). It blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps cancer to grow. Bevacizumab is usually used in combination with an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. Interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. It encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells.
Another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that’s spread. It’s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections.
Aldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.
Immunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. This is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects.

Preventing kidney cancer
As the causes of kidney cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to completely prevent it.
However, leading a healthy lifestyle may help reduce your chances of developing the condition.
Read about the
causes of kidney cancer
.
Combining a
healthy diet
and
regular exercise
will help you avoid becoming overweight or obese, which are both significant risk factors for kidney cancer.
If you’re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular physical activity with a calorie-controlled diet.
Read more about
healthy weight loss
and
treating obesity
.
Diet
A low-fat, high-fibre diet that includes whole grains and plenty of fresh
fruit and vegetables
(at least 5 portions a day) is recommended for a healthy heart.
You should also limit the amount of
salt
in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure.
Avoid eating foods high in
saturated fat
because it will increase your cholesterol level. High-fat foods include:
meat pies
sausages and fatty cuts of meat
butter
ghee – a type of clarified butter often used in Indian cooking
lard
cream
hard cheese
cakes and biscuits
foods that contain coconut or palm oil
There’s some evidence that eating a diet that has plenty of oily fish (at least 1 portion a week) may help reduce the risk of kidney cancer. Examples of oily fish include:
salmon
mackerel
sardines
trout
herring
Oily fish also contains
vitamin D
, which can reduce the risk of some cancers. You can also get vitamin D from sunlight or by taking supplements.
Exercise
It’s recommended that adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as
cycling
or brisk
walking
, every week.
The exercise should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate and you should feel slightly out of breath afterwards.
Examples of activities you could incorporate into your exercise programme include:
brisk walking
hill climbing
running
cycling
swimming
If you find it difficult to do 150 minutes of exercise a week, start at a level you feel comfortable with.
However, you should visit your GP for a health check if you’ve never exercised before or you’re returning to exercise after a long period of time.

Giving up smoking
If you smoke, giving up is the most effective way of preventing kidney cancer, as well as a number of other serious health conditions, such as
stroke
,
heart attack
and
lung cancer
.
Your GP can help if you want to stop smoking, by giving you information and advice, and prescribing medication.
Our
stopping smoking pages
have useful information and advice about giving up smoking. Alternatively, you can call
Quit Your Way Scotland
on 0800 84 84 84.

giving up smoking
.
Alcohol
There’s evidence to suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, such as 4 to 5 glasses of wine a month, will help reduce your risk of developing kidney cancer. The reasons for this aren’t fully understood.
However, you shouldn’t exceed the recommended limits for alcohol, because excessive drinking will place you at risk of developing
liver disease

liver cancer
, and
high blood pressure (hypertension)

Introduction
Insomnia is difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep for long enough to feel refreshed the next morning.
It’s a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people.
If you have insomnia, you may:
find it difficult to fall asleep
lie awake for long periods at night
wake up several times during the night
wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep
not feel refreshed when you get up
find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired
feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating
Occasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time.
Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you’re able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.
How much sleep do I need?
There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.
On average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.
What’s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.
You’re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it’s affecting your everyday life.
What causes insomnia?
It’s not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it’s often associated with:
stress and anxiety
a poor sleeping environment – such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that’s too light, noisy, hot or cold
lifestyle factors – such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed
mental health conditions – such as
depression
and
schizophrenia
physical health conditions – such as heart problems, other sleep disorders and long-term pain
certain medicines – such as some
antidepressants
,
epilepsy
medicines and
steroid medication
Read more about the
causes of insomnia
What you can do about it
There are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night’s sleep if you have insomnia.
These include:
setting regular times for going to bed and waking up
relaxing before bed time – try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music
using thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise
avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed
not watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before going to bed
not napping during the day
writing a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about them until the morning
Some people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don’t address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects.

self-help tips for insomnia
When to see your GP
Make an appointment to see your GP if you’re finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it’s affecting your daily life – particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped.
Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise.
They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia.
Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns.
Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night.
Treatments for insomnia
Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.
They’ll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.
In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended.
This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It’s usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.
Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.
This is because they don’t treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time.
Read more about
treating insomnia
Causes
Insomnia can be triggered by a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use.
Sometimes it’s not possible to identify a clear cause.
Stress and anxiety
Some people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties.
The problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. This develops into an anxiety about sleep itself.
Having more general worries – for example, about work, family or health – are also likely to keep you awake at night.
These can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep.
Poor sleep routine and sleeping environment
You may struggle to get a good night’s sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don’t “wind down” before going to bed.
A poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia – for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that’s too bright, noisy, hot or cold.
Lifestyle factors
Drinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). These should be avoided in the evenings.
Changes to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia – for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag).
Mental health conditions
Underlying mental health problems can often affect a person’s sleeping patterns, including:
mood disorders – such as
depression
or
bipolar disorder
anxiety disorders– such as generalised anxiety,
panic disorder
or
post-traumatic stress disorder
psychotic disorders – such as
schizophrenia
Physical health conditions
Insomnia can also be caused by underlying physical conditions, including:
heart conditions – such as
angina
or
heart failure
respiratory conditions – such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
or
asthma
neurological conditions – such as
Alzheimer’s disease
or
Parkinson’s disease
hormonal problems – such as an
overactive thyroid
joint or muscle problems – such as
arthritis
problems with the genital or urinary organs – such as
urinary incontinence
or an
enlarged prostate
sleep disorders – such as snoring and
sleep apnoea
,
restless legs syndrome
, narcolepsy, night terrors and sleepwalking
long-term pain
In women, childbirth can sometimes lead to insomnia.
Medication
Some prescriptions or over-the-counter medications can cause insomnia as a side effect.
These include:
certain
antidepressants
epilepsy
medicines
medicines for
high blood pressure
, such as
beta-blockers
steroid medication
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
stimulant medicines used to treat
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
or narcolepsy
some medicines used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline
Check the leaflet that comes with any medication you’re taking to see if insomnia or sleeping difficulties are listed as a possible side effect.
Self-help tips
Insomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment.
Making small changes may help you to get a good night’s sleep. Try some of the methods below for a few weeks to see if they help.
See your GP if you’re still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques.
Daytime habits
Set a specific time for getting up each day. Try to stick to this time, seven days a week, even if you feel you haven’t had enough sleep. This should help you sleep better at night.
Don’t take a nap during the day.
Take daily exercise, such as 30 minutes
walking
or
cycling
. But don’t exercise for at least four hours before going to bed, because this may make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Bedtime habits
Stop drinking tea and coffee for a few hours before bedtime.
Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking, particularly shortly before going to bed.
Don’t eat a big meal just before bedtime.
Only go to bed when you’re feeling tired. If necessary, go to bed later than usual if it means you might be able to fall asleep more quickly.
Don’t use back-lit devices shortly before going to bed, including televisions, phones, tablets and computers.
Try to create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, listening to soft music, and drinking a warm, milky drink every night. These activities will be associated with sleep and will cause drowsiness.
Avoid regularly using over-the-counter sleeping tablets. It is not clear how effective these are, they don’t tackle the underlying problem, and have potential side effects. Read more about

Don’t lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. Instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again.
Avoid watching the clock because it will only make you anxious about how long it’s taking you to fall asleep.
Write a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. This may help you forget about them until the morning.
Bedroom environment
Use thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep.
Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping.
Wear ear plugs if noise is a problem.
Don’t use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. Avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you’re in bed.
Make sure your mattress is comfortable and that you have a pillow you like, as well as adequate bedding for the time of year.
Treatments
Insomnia will often improve by making changes to your bedtime habits. If these don’t help, your GP may be able to recommend other treatments.
If you’ve had insomnia for more than four weeks, your GP may recommend cognitive and behavioural treatments or suggest a short course of prescription sleeping tablets as a temporary measure.
If it’s possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.
The various treatments for insomnia are outlined below.
Good sleeping habits
Your GP will be able to advise you about what you can do at home to help you sleep. This is known as “sleep hygiene” and includes:
establishing fixed times for going to bed and waking up
creating a relaxing bedtime routine
only going to bed when you feel tired
maintaining a comfortable sleeping environment that’s not too hot, cold, noisy or bright
not napping during the day
avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late at night
avoiding eating a heavy meal late at night

Cognitive and behavioural treatments
If changing your sleeping habits doesn’t help, your GP may be able to refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that’s specifically designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I).
The aim of CBT-I is to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your insomnia. It’s an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.
CBT-I may include:
stimulus-control therapy – which aims to help you associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern
sleep restriction therapy – limiting the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves
relaxation training – aims to reduce tension or minimise intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep
paradoxical intention – you try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep; it’s used if you have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep
biofeedback – sensors connected to a machine are placed on your body to measure your body’s functions, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help you recognise when you’re not relaxed
CBT-I is sometimes carried out by a specially trained GP. Alternatively, you may be referred to a clinical psychologist.
The therapy may be carried out in a small group with other people who have similar sleep problems, or one-to-one with a therapist. Self-help books and online courses may also be used.
Sleeping tablets
Sleeping tablets (hypnotics) are medications that encourage sleep. In the past, they were frequently used to help with insomnia, but they’re used much less often nowadays.
They will generally only be considered:
if your insomnia is severe
as a temporary measure to help ease short-term insomnia
if the good sleep habits and cognitive and behavioural treatments mentioned above don’t help
Doctors are usually reluctant to recommend sleeping tablets in the long-term because they just mask the symptoms without treating the underlying cause.
They can also cause potentially dangerous side effects, such as drowsiness the following morning, and some people become dependent on them.
If they are recommended, you should have the smallest effective dose possible for the shortest time (usually no more than two to four weeks).
Over-the-counter sleeping pills
A number of sleeping tablets are available to buy over the counter (OTC) from pharmacies. These are usually a type of antihistamine medicine that causes you to feel drowsy.
Taking OTC sleeping tablets regularly isn’t usually recommended if you have insomnia, because it’s not clear how effective they are, they don’t tackle the underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties and they can cause side effects.
In particular, they can cause you to feel drowsy the next morning, which can make activities such as driving and operating machinery dangerous.
Speak to your GP for advice if you find yourself needing to take OTC sleeping tablets regularly.
Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are prescription medicines that can reduce anxiety and promote calmness, relaxation and sleep. Your GP may prescribe them for a short time if you have severe insomnia or it’s causing extreme distress.
Examples of benzodiazepines include temazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam.
Long-term treatment with benzodiazepines isn’t usually recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent upon them.
They can also cause a number of side effects, including:
drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day
finding it difficult to concentrate or make decisions
depression
feeling emotionally numb
irritability
You should avoid driving if you feel drowsy, dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions, as you may not be able to do so safely.
Z-drugs
Z–drugs are a newer type of medicine that work in a similar way to benzodiazepines and are similarly effective. They include zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.
As with benzodiazepines, long-term treatment with Z–drugs isn’t normally recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent on them.
They’re usually only prescribed for a maximum of two to four weeks.
Side effects of Z-drugs can include:
drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day
feeling and being sick
diarrhoea
increased snoring and breathing problems during sleep
dry mouth
confusion
Z–drugs can also sometimes cause psychiatric reactions, such as delusions, nightmares and hallucinations. Contact your GP if you experience any of these effects.
Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on
zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomnia
for more information.
Melatonin (Circadin)
For adults aged 55 or over, a medication called Circadin is sometimes used to help relieve insomnia for a few weeks. It contains a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the sleep cycle.
Circadin is usually only recommended for three weeks at first, but it can be continued for a total of 13 weeks if it helps.
Common side effects of Circadin include:
headaches
cold-like symptoms
back pain
joint pain
Treatments that aren’t recommended
The following treatments aren’t normally recommended for insomnia, because it’s not clear how effective they are and they can sometimes cause side effects:
antidepressants
(unless you also have depression)
chloral hydrate
clomethiazole
barbiturates
herbal remedies, such as valerian extract
complementary and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy and reflexology"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/itchy-bottom/,"Itchy bottom
Itchy bottom is a strong urge to scratch the skin around your bottom (anus).
The anus is the opening at the lower end of the digestive system, where solid waste leaves your body.
Causes of itchy bottom
The cause of itchy bottom isn’t always known. If it gets better quickly without treatment, it may be the result of a short term issue. For example, sweating more in hot weather.
It’s rare for an itchy bottom alone to be a sign of something more serious.
If an itchy bottom lasts longer, you may be able to get an idea of the cause from other symptoms you have. But, you should not self-diagnose. Speak to your GP if you’re worried.
An itchy bottom that’s worse at night can be caused by threadworms. This is often the case for children.
You can’t take medicine for threadworms if you’re:
pregnant
breastfeeding
a child under 2
This means you should speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor instead.
Conditions with itchy bottom
Sometimes an itchy bottom can be a symptom of another problem or condition. This includes:
skin conditions
like
eczema
or
psoriasis
– if you have itching elsewhere on the body too
threadworms
(especially in children) – symptoms will get worse at night and there will be worms in poo (they look like bits of thread)
haemorrhoids (piles)
– swellings in and around the anus, as well as pain and blood when pooing
bowel incontinence
or
diarrhoea
– can cause poo leaking or pooing you can not control
sexually transmitted infection (STI)
like
genital warts
– can cause sores, swelling and irritation
ringworm
– can cause sores, swelling and irritation
Some long-term medications can also cause an itchy bottom. For example, steroid creams or peppermint oil.
When to get help
A pharmacist can often help to treat an itchy bottom. You can ask if they have a private area to discuss your symptoms.
They can suggest treatments like:
creams and ointments to relieve itching
medication if the symptoms are caused by threadworms
Find your nearest pharmacy
Speak to your GP if:
You have an itchy bottom that:
doesn’t get better after 3 to 4 days
keeps coming back
makes you anxious or depressed
affects your sleep
is painful
is accompanied by other symptoms, like itching elsewhere on your body
You should also speak to a GP if your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition like piles.
What to expect at your GP appointment
Your GP might need to check your bottom (a rectal examination) to help find out what’s causing your itching. You may feel awkward, but this is nothing to be embarrassed or worried about. It’s one of the most common examinations GPs carry out.
At your appointment, your GP may ask:
whether you use creams, powders or soaps around your bottom
how long you have had the itching
whether the itching gets worse at night or after eating certain foods
if you have any other symptoms
Your GP will decide on the best treatment for you depending on what’s causing your symptoms. They may suggest:
things you can do yourself to ease an itchy bottom
a stronger medication, cream or ointment
How to ease an itchy bottom yourself
Do
use soft toilet tissue
bath or shower daily
have shorter, cooler showers and baths
keep your bottom clean and dry
wear loose-fitting cotton underwear
change your underwear daily
only put underwear on when your bottom is completely dry
use a light duvet at night so you don’t get too hot
gently wash and dry your bottom after pooing and before bed
keep your fingernails short to stop your skin from being damaged by scratching
wear cotton gloves while sleeping to avoid damaging the skin if you scratch
wear stockings instead of tights
eat foods with fibre (fruit, vegetables and wholegrains) to help produce regular, solid poo
Don’t
do not wear tight clothing
do not use scented soaps, bubble bath or perfumes
do not use scented powders near your bottom
do not scratch if you can
do not eat food or drink that makes your itching worse, for example caffeine, alcohol, citrus fruit or spicy foods"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/ingrown-toenail/,"Ingrown toenail
An ingrown toenail develops when the sides of the toenail grow into the surrounding skin.
The big toe is often affected, either on one or both sides. The nail curls and pierces the skin, which becomes red, swollen and tender.
Other possible symptoms include:
pain if pressure is placed on the toe
inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe
a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe
an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy)
bleeding
white or yellow pus coming from the affected area
When to get professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Infected ingrown toenail treatment from your pharmacy
Adults 18 years and over with an infected ingrown toenail can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy in certain instances. If the pharmacist cannot treat you they may recommend you see your podiatrist or GP.
Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service directory.
What causes ingrown toenails?
A number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including:
badly cut toenails – cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin
wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights – this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it’s pressed on to your toenail
sweaty feet – if the skin around your toenails is soft, it’s easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it
injury – for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop
natural shape of the nail – the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail
A
fungal nail infection
can cause your toenail to thicken or widen.
Treating ingrown toenails
Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it’s important that you:
keep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water
change your socks regularly
cut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin
gently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin)
wear comfortable shoes that fit properly
Surgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn’t improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail.
Partial nail avulsion
Partial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most commonly used operation for treating ingrown toenails. It’s about 98% effective.
A
local anaesthetic
is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future.
A course of
antibiotics
may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away.
Total nail avulsion
Total nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you’ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it’s perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail.
After surgery
After toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1 to 2 days after the operation.
To help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as
paracetamol
, and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery.
Preventing ingrown toenails
Taking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It’s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges).
Wash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin.
Wearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day.
Visit your GP or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet."

About laryngeal cancer
Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box).
The larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). It plays an important role in helping you breathe and speak.
The condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It’s about 4 times more common in men than women.
Symptoms of laryngeal cancer
The main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include:
a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse
pain when swallowing or
difficulty swallowing
a lump or swelling in your neck
a long-lasting
cough
a persistent
sore throat
or
earache
in severe cases, difficulty breathing
Some people may also experience bad breath,
breathlessness
, a high-pitched wheezing noise when breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness).
When to speak to your GP
You should speak to your GP if you have had any of the main symptoms for more than 3 weeks.
These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as
laryngitis
, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.

What causes laryngeal cancer?
It’s not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:
smoking tobacco
regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol
having a family history of head and neck cancer
having an unhealthy diet
exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust
By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.

causes of laryngeal cancer
and

How laryngeal cancer is treated
The main treatments for laryngeal cancer are
radiotherapy
, surgery and
chemotherapy
.
Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it’s diagnosed early.
If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.
If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you’ll no longer be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice.
This may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound.

treating laryngeal cancer
and
recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery

Causes of laryngeal cancer
Laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it’s not clear exactly why this happens.
All cancers begin with a change in a cell’s DNA. DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce.
A change in DNA can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. This causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour.
It’s not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.
What can increase your risk?
A number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.
Alcohol and tobacco
Alcohol and tobacco are the 2 main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They’re thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx.
The more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.
People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than people who don’t smoke.
Compared to people who don’t drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about 3 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer.
If you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition. Read more about
preventing laryngeal cancer
.
Family history
People who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history.
Diet
There’s evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.
Having a ‘Mediterranean diet’ or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk. Read more about
preventing laryngeal cancer
.
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix (neck of the womb), anus, mouth and throat.
HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to
cervical cancer
. It’s thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. HPV is often spread during sex, including oral sex.
Exposure to harmful substances
Having a job where you’re exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include:
asbestos
coal or wood dust
paint or diesel fumes
nickel
sulphuric acid fumes
formaldehyde (a chemical used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics)
isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)
Diagnosing laryngeal cancer
If you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your GP will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.
They may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings.
If laryngeal cancer is suspected, you’ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that anyone aged 45 or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks.
Nasendoscopy
A nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx.
During the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor.
You’ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable. A
local anaesthetic
spray is sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don’t feel any pain.
Laryngoscopy
If it wasn’t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy.
Like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail.
A laryngoscopy can be very uncomfortable, so it’s usually carried out under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you’ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.
Biopsy
During a nasendoscopy or laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a
biopsy
.
Alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration.
Further testing
If the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there’s a risk it may have spread, you’ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue
a PET-CT scan – a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you’ve been injected with a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly
an
ultrasound scan
– high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx
Staging and grading
After these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer.
Healthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
the T stage is given as a number from 1 to 4 – small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4
the N stage is given as a number from 0 to 3 – N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected
the M stage is given as either M0 or M1 – M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has
There are also 3 different grades (1 to 3) used to describe laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread. Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3, grow quickly and are more likely to spread.
You can read more about the
stages and grades of laryngeal cancer
on the Cancer Research UK website.
Treating laryngeal cancer
The treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. The main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.
Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of specialists that work together to decide the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Members of your MDT will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care.
Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask your care team. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Your treatment plan
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the cancer (see
diagnosing laryngeal cancer
for more information on staging).
If you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or
radiotherapy
alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required.
In later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and
chemotherapy
will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed.
A medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. It’s sometimes combined with chemotherapy.
The energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx. To ensure the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. A mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts.
Radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from Monday to Friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. The course of treatment usually lasts for 3 to 7 weeks.
As well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including:
sore, red skin (similar to
sunburn
)
mouth ulcers
dry mouth
loss of taste
loss of appetite
tiredness
feeling sick
Your MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth.
Radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit
your local accident and emergency (A&E) department
as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing.
Most side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing.
Read more about
radiotherapy
.
Surgery
There are 3 types of surgery that can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are:
endoscopic resection
partial laryngectomy
total laryngectomy
Endoscopic resection
Endoscopic resection can be used in early-stage laryngeal cancer.
During the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments.
An endoscopic resection is carried out under
general anaesthetic
, so you will be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain.
Your mouth and throat may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there’s a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent.
Partial laryngectomy
A partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.
While your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon may need to create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy.
Once your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar.
This operation is uncommon nowadays, as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible.
Total laryngectomy
A total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them.
As your vocal cords will be removed, you won’t be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech.
If you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation.
You will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months.
See
recovering from laryngeal cancer
for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective.
It can also be used to treat laryngeal cancer that’s advanced or has come back after treatment. In this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer’s growth.
Chemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every 3 or 4 weeks, for up to 6 months. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time.
Chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as:
feeling and being sick
hair loss
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
sore mouth and mouth ulcers
tiredness
Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness.
It’s therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your MDT, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. You should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.
The side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished.
Read more about
chemotherapy
.
Cetuximab
Cetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce.
Cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it’s not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill.
Cetuximab is given slowly through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It’s usually given weekly for up to 7 weeks.
Side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include:
rashes
feeling sick
diarrhoea
breathlessness
Cetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases, the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
Most serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you’ll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. If you have symptoms of a severe reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as
corticosteroids
).
Recovering from laryngeal cancer
If you’ve had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it’s likely that you’ll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you’ve recovered.
You won’t be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people takes at least a week or two. While your throat heals, you’ll need to be fed through a tube that’s passed through your nose and into your stomach.
If you’ve had all of your larynx removed (total laryngectomy), you won’t be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords. A number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take weeks or months to learn.
Therefore, it’s likely that you’ll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper, during the first few weeks or months after surgery. This can be a frustrating experience – the loss of something you’ve previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with.
Try to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways. Some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they’re deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak.
Your emotions
The emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. Many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect.
For example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy.
These emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings of
depression
. You may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing things you enjoy.
Contact your GP or care team for advice if you think you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments available.
The
National Association of Laryngectomee Clubs (NALC)
is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. NALC is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy.
Looking after your stoma
If you’ve had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). During the first few months after surgery, it’s likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you’ve had
radiotherapy
.
Excessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. Once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed.
It’s important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection. A specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean.
You’ll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs.
It’s important to remember that you’ll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. This is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma.
Speaking after surgery
If your larynx has been completely removed as part of your treatment for laryngeal cancer, you’ll need additional treatment to help restore your voice.
Before your laryngectomy, you may meet a speech and language therapist (SLT) to discuss possible treatment options for restoring your voice. An SLT is a healthcare professional who specialises in helping people who have difficulties speaking and using language.
There are several different treatment options.
Voice prosthesis
A voice prosthesis is an artificial valve implanted into your neck. When you want to speak, you cover the stoma and breathe out through the valve.
The valve produces a noise, which you can use to make words by moving your lips and mouth in the usual way. The voice that’s produced by the valve sounds natural, although it may be lower-pitched than your previous voice.
If you choose to have a voice prosthesis, it can be fitted during the surgery to remove your larynx.
Oesophageal speech
Oesophageal speech is a technique for speaking that your SLT can teach you. It involves learning to push air through your oesophagus (gullet). As the air moves through your oesophagus, it vibrates and makes a noise. You can produce words by moving your lips and mouth.
Some people find it quite easy to learn oesophageal speech, whereas others find it difficult. Regular practice by yourself and with your SLT can help you improve.
Electrolarynx
An electrolarynx is a small, battery-operated electrical device that vibrates and produces sound. You hold the device under your chin, and as you move your mouth and lips the vibrations translate into spoken words. Your SLT can train you to use it correctly.
Preventing laryngeal cancer
It’s thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle.
Avoiding tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition.
Avoiding tobacco products
Using tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.
Tobacco comes in many forms, including:
cigarettes
pipe tobacco
cigars
cigarillos
snuff (powdered tobacco snorted through the nose)
chewing tobacco
If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.
If you decide to stop smoking your free
NHS stop smoking service
can help you give up. You can also call
Quit Your Way Scotland
on 0800 84 84 84 for free expert advice and support.
If you want to stop smoking, but don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may have.
Read more about
stopping smoking
.
Cutting down on alcohol
Staying within the
recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption
will also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal and liver cancers.
Studies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5 to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20 to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol.
Contact your GP if you’re finding it difficult to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. You may need additional treatment, which could include counselling, group work or medication.
Read more about
treatments for alcohol misuse
and
tips on cutting down how much you drink
.
Healthy diet
Research shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil, may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. This type of diet is sometimes known as a ‘Mediterranean diet’.
Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables each day may help to reduce your chances of developing many types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.

About iron deficiency anaemia
Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells.
Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won’t get as much oxygen as they usually would.
There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.
Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body – read more about
vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia
.
Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia
Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.
You may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a
stomach ulcer
.
The most common symptoms include:
tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)
shortness of breath
noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)
a pale complexion
Less common symptoms include:
headache
hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source
(tinnitus)
an altered sense of taste
feeling itchy
a sore or abnormally smooth tongue
hair loss
a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)
difficulty swallowing
(dysphagia)
painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth
spoon-shaped nails
When to see your GP
See your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple
blood test
.
Read more about
diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia
What causes iron deficiency anaemia?
There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.
This can be caused by a stomach ulcer,
stomach cancer
,
bowel cancer
, or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
In women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.
Unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you’re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.
Read more about the
causes of iron deficiency anaemia
How iron deficiency anaemia is treated
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.
You’ll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.
The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don’t get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.
Good sources of iron include:
dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale
iron-fortified cereals or bread
brown rice
pulses and beans
nuts and seeds
meat, fish and tofu
eggs
dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins
Read more about
treating iron deficiency anaemia
Further problems
If iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the body’s natural defence system (the immune system).
Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or
heart failure
, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.
Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.
Read more about the
complications of iron deficiency anaemia
Causes of iron deficiency anaemia
Iron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn’t have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.
A lack of iron can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are outlined below.
Monthly periods
In women of reproductive age, periods are the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia.
Usually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it’s known as menorrhagia.
Pregnancy
It’s also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy.
This is because your body needs extra iron to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.
Some pregnant women require an iron supplement, while others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet.

vitamins and minerals in pregnancy
Gastrointestinal blood loss
The gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines.
Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who’ve experienced the
menopause
(when monthly periods stop).
Most people with gastrointestinal bleeding don’t notice any obvious blood in their stools and don’t experience any changes in their bowel habits.
Some causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
can cause bleeding in the stomach.
Ibuprofen
and
aspirin
are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs.
If your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don’t stop taking a medicine you’ve been prescribed unless your GP advises you to.
Stomach ulcers
The acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a
stomach ulcer
or a peptic ulcer.
Stomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. In some cases, the bleeding can cause you to vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. However, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not have any symptoms.
Gastrointestinal cancer
In a few cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually
stomach cancer
or
bowel cancer
.
When trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer.
If your GP suspects cancer, you’ll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. This means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible.
If you’re 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP should refer you to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your  appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you.
Angiodysplasia
Gastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is the result of abnormal, fragile superficial blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding.
Chronic kidney disease
People with
chronic kidney disease (CKD)
often develop iron deficiency anaemia.
Most people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets may be tried first.
You can read more about
treating anaemia in people with CKD
on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website.
Other causes
Other conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include:
inflammatory bowel disease – a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such as
Crohn’s disease
and
ulcerative colitis
oesophagitis – inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus) caused by stomach acid leaking through it
schistosomiasis – an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa
blood donation – donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia
trauma – a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood
nosebleeds
– having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although this is rare
haematuria (blood in your urine) – but this rarely causes anaemia and may be a symptom of another condition
Malabsorption
Malabsorption is when your body can’t absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia.
This may happen if you have
coeliac disease
, a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy).
Lack of iron in your diet
Unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet.
However, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above.
Some studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet.
If you are vegetarian or vegan, it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as:
beans
nuts
dried fruit, such as dried apricots
wholegrains, such as brown rice
fortified breakfast cereals
soybean flour
most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale
If you’re pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia.

vegetarian and vegan diets
Diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia
See your GP if you experience
symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia
, such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations.
A simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis.
Your GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia.
Blood test
To diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count is made. This means all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured.
If you have anaemia:
your levels of haemoglobin – a substance that transports oxygen – will be lower than normal
you’ll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal
your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual
Your GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn’t much iron stored in your body and you may have iron deficiency anaemia.
Read more about
blood tests
Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency
If your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells.
Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia
is more common in people who are over the age of 75.
Finding the cause
To determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about:
your diet – to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods
any medicines you take – to see if you’ve been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as
ibuprofen
or
aspirin
your menstrual pattern – if you’re a woman, your GP may ask if you’ve been experiencing particularly heavy periods
your family history – you’ll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders
Iron deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. If you’re pregnant, your GP will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else.
Physical examination
A physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn’t been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms.
In such cases, your GP may:
examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding
look for signs of
heart failure
, such as swollen ankles – heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemia
Two other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below.
Rectal examination
A rectal examination is usually only needed if you’re bleeding from your bottom. It’s a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there’s something in your gastrointestinal tract that’s causing bleeding.
Your GP will insert a lubricated gloved finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities.
A rectal examination isn’t something to be embarrassed about, as it’s a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn’t cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort – this will only last for a minute.
Pelvic examination
Women may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia.
During a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection.
They may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your womb (uterus) is tender or enlarged.
A pelvic examination won’t be carried out without your consent (permission), and you can choose to have someone with you.
Referral to a specialist
In some cases, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. They’ll carry out a more thorough examination.
For example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your GP can’t identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your GP thinks there’s a possibility your symptoms could be caused by
stomach cancer
or
bowel cancer
, although this is unlikely.
If you’re a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don’t respond to treatment with iron supplements.
Treating iron deficiency anaemia
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause.
Iron supplements
Your GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, which is taken as a tablet, usually twice a day.
Some people can experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including:
abdominal (tummy) pain
constipation
or
diarrhoea
heartburn
feeling sick
black stools (faeces)
These side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects.
Your GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you’re finding side effects difficult to cope with.
If you can’t take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate.
This supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored.
In a few cases – for example, if you have
chronic kidney disease (CKD)
– iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets.
As with all medications, it’s important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal.
Dietary advice
If a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake.
Iron-rich foods include:
dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale
iron-fortified cereals or bread
brown rice
pulses and beans
nuts and seeds
white and red meat
fish
tofu
eggs
dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins
Your diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it’s healthy and balanced. In particular, food and drink containing vitamin C are important as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron.
However, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain medicines, may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include:
tea and coffee
calcium – found in dairy products, such as milk
antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – medications used to relieve
indigestion
wholegrain cereals – although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills
You may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you’re finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They’ll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can improve your diet.
Treating the underlying cause
Your GP will also need to ensure the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so it doesn’t happen again.
For example, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding.
Heavy periods can be treated with medication or – in particularly severe cases – surgery.
Monitoring
Your GP will ask you to return two to four weeks after you’ve started taking iron supplements to check how well you’ve responded to the treatment. You’ll have a
blood test
to check your haemoglobin levels.
If your blood test results show an improvement, you’ll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four months for another blood test.
Once your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body.
After this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later.
Continuing treatment
Sometimes after a person’s iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again.
This could happen if you don’t get enough iron in your diet, you’re pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods.
In such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you’ll have to take once a day.
If treatment is ineffective
If your iron levels don’t improve, your GP will ask how regularly you’ve been taking your iron supplements.
Some people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won’t improve if you don’t take the supplements.
If you’ve been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven’t improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.
Complications of iron deficiency anaemia
Iron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications, although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life.
Some common complications are outlined below.
Tiredness
Iron deficiency anaemia can make you feel tired and lacking in energy (lethargic). This may result in you being less productive at work, and you may find it difficult to stay awake or not feel able to exercise regularly.
Increased risk of infections
Research has shown iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system – the body’s natural defence system. This increases your vulnerability to infection.
Heart and lung problems
Adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs.
For example, you may develop
tachycardia
, which is an abnormally fast heartbeat, or
heart failure
, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.
Pregnancy complications
Pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after birth.
They may also develop
postnatal depression
, which some women experience after having a baby.
Research suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to:
be born prematurely – before the 37th week of pregnancy
have a low birth weight
have problems with iron levels themselves
do less well in mental ability tests
Restless legs syndrome
Some cases of
restless legs syndrome
are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. Doctors often refer to this as secondary restless legs syndrome.
Restless legs syndrome is a common condition that affects the nervous system, and causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs. It also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet, calves and thighs.
Restless legs syndrome caused by iron deficiency anaemia can usually be treated with iron supplements."

About labyrinthitis
Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection. It causes a delicate structure deep inside your ear called the labyrinth to become inflamed, affecting your hearing and balance.
The most common symptoms are
dizziness
,
hearing loss
(from mild to total loss of hearing) and
vertigo
– the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving.
These symptoms can range from mild to severe, with some people feeling that they are unable to remain upright. Other symptoms include:
a feeling of pressure inside your ear(s)
ringing or humming in your ear(s) (
tinnitus
)
fluid or pus leaking out of your ear(s)
ear pain
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
changes in vision, such as blurred vision or double vision
mild headaches
Certain things can make the dizziness worse, including:
colds or illness
the dark
being in crowded areas or small rooms
tiredness
a women’s period
walking
See your GP if you have these symptoms.
You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery, or working at heights if you’re feeling dizzy.
Treating labyrinthitis
In most cases, the symptoms pass within a few weeks.
Treatment
involves a combination of bed rest and medication to help you cope better with the symptoms. You may need additional medication to fight the underlying infection, although antibiotics are not often required as the cause is most commonly due to a virus.
Contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
A small number of people have persistent symptoms that last for several months, or possibly years. This requires a more intensive type of treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).

The labyrinth
The labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains two important parts:
the cochlea – this relays sounds to the brain and is responsible for hearing
the vestibular system – a complex set of fluid-filled channels that contributes to your sense of balance
Inflammation of the labyrinth can disrupt your hearing and sense of balance, triggering the symptoms of labyrinthitis. The labyrinth usually becomes inflamed either because of:
a viral infection, such as a
cold
or
flu
a bacterial infection, which is much less common
Read more about the
causes of labyrinthitis
Who gets labyrinthitis?
Most cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is relatively common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more widespread in children. Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under two years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.
Complications of labyrinthitis
Bacterial labyrinthitis carries a higher risk of causing permanent hearing loss, particularly in children who have developed it as a complication of meningitis.
Because of this high risk, a hearing test is recommended following bacterial labyrinthitis.
Severe hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.
Read more information about
hearing loss
Vestibular neuronitis
Many people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.
This is actually known as vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.
However, both terms are often used to describe the same diagnosis.
Causes of labyrinthitis
Labyrinthitis is caused by inflammation of part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. This is caused by an infection.
How the labyrinth works
The fluid-filled channels of the labyrinth are known as the vestibular system and they are connected at different angles. This fluid moves when you move your head, telling your brain how far, fast and in what direction your head is moving. This allows your body to balance properly. The vestibular system works in a similar way to a stereo, with your left and right ears sending separate signals to your brain. If one ear becomes infected, these signals become out of sync, which confuses your brain and triggers symptoms such as dizziness and loss of balance.
The labyrinth also contains a small, spiral-shaped cavity called the cochlea. It sends sound waves to the language processing areas of the brain. Inflammation can disrupt this function, leading to hearing loss.
Viral labyrinthitis
Around half of all cases of viral labyrinthitis are thought to be caused when a viral infection of the chest, nose, mouth and airways – such as the
common cold
or
flu
– spreads to the inner ear.
Infections that affect the rest of the body, such as
measles
,
mumps
or
glandular fever
, are a less common cause of viral labyrinthitis.
Bacterial labyrinthitis
Labyrinthitis can sometimes be caused by a bacterial infection. This is rarer than a viral infection and is likely to be more serious.
Bacteria can enter the labyrinth if the thin layers of tissue that separate your middle ear from your inner ear are broken. This can happen if you have a
middle ear infection
or an infection of the brain lining (
meningitis
). Bacteria can also get into your inner ear if you have had a head injury.
Immune system problems
Labyrinthitis often develops in people who have an underlying autoimmune condition (where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue rather than fighting off infections).
Diagnosing labyrinthitis
Many conditions can cause dizziness and vertigo. Your GP will usually diagnose labyrinthitis based on your symptoms, your medical history and a physical examination.
Your GP may carry out the following tests:
a physical examination – you may be asked to move your head or body and your ears will be checked for signs of inflammation and infection
hearing tests – labyrinthitis is more likely if you have
hearing loss
Your GP will also check your eyes. If they are flickering uncontrollably, it is usually a sign that your vestibular system (the body’s balancing system) is not working properly.
Viral or bacterial labyrinthitis?
There is no reliable test to determine whether labyrinthitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection because testing for infection would damage the labyrinth.
Doctors can usually safely assume that labyrinthitis is the result of a viral infection (more common) unless there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise, such as:
the labyrinthitis is in a very young child
labyrinthitis occurs in someone who is already known to have a bacterial infection
you have common bacterial labyrinthitis symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and complete hearing loss
Further testing
Further testing is usually only required if you have additional symptoms that suggest you may have a more serious condition, such as meningitis or a stroke. Symptoms can include:
severe headache
mental confusion
slurred speech
weakness or paralysis on one side of your body
These tests can include:
a lumbar puncture – a fluid sample is taken from the base of your spine and checked for infection
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– to give a three-dimensional picture of your brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– to give a detailed image of your brain
blood tests
Treating labyrinthitis
Labyrinthitis is usually treated using a combination of self-help techniques and medication. Chronic labyrinthitis may be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).
Self-help
Drink plenty of liquid, little and often, particularly water, to avoid becoming
dehydrated
.
In its early stages, you may feel constantly dizzy and it can give you severe vertigo. You should rest in bed to avoid falling and injuring yourself. After a few days, the worst of these symptoms should have passed and you should no longer feel dizzy all the time.
You can do several things to minimise any remaining feelings of dizziness and
vertigo
. For example:
during an attack, lie still in a comfortable position (on your side is often best)
avoid alcohol
avoid bright lights
try to cut out noise and anything that causes stress from your surroundings
You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery or working at heights if you’re feeling dizzy and unbalanced.
Medication
If your dizziness, vertigo and loss of balance are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe a short course of medication such as benzodiazepine or antiemetics (vestibular sedatives).
Benzodiazepine
Benzodiazepines reduce activity inside your central nervous system. This means your brain is less likely to be affected by the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.
However, long-term use of benzodiazepines is not recommended because they can be highly addictive if used for long periods.
Antiemetics
A prescription medication known as an antiemetic may be prescribed if you’re experiencing nausea and vomiting.
Prochlorperazine 5mg tablets are an antiemetic used to treat the symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. It may be considered as an alternative treatment to benzodiazepines.
Most people are able to tolerate prochlorperazine and side effects are uncommon, but can include:
tremors (shaking)
abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements
sleepiness
If you are vomiting, there is a prochlorperazine 3mg tablet available which you place inside your mouth between your gums and cheek.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids
such as prednisolone may be recommended if your symptoms are particularly severe. They are often effective at reducing inflammation.
Antibiotics
If your labyrinthitis is thought to be caused by a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed
antibiotics
. Depending on how serious the infection is, this could either be antibiotic tablets or capsules (oral antibiotics) or antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics).
Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines for a full list of possible side effects.
When to seek further advice
Contact your GP if you develop additional symptoms that suggest your condition may be getting worse. If this happens, you may be admitted to hospital. These symptoms include:
mental confusion
slurred speech
double vision
weakness or numbness in one part of your body
a change in the way you usually walk
Also contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
Chronic labyrinthitis
A small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or even years. This is sometimes known as chronic labyrinthitis.
The symptoms are not usually as severe as when you first get the condition, although even mild dizziness can have a considerable impact on your quality of life, employment and other daily activities.
Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)
Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an effective treatment for people with chronic labyrinthitis. VRT attempts to “retrain” your brain and nervous system to compensate for the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.
VRT is usually carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist and involves a range of exercises designed to:
co-ordinate your hand and eye movements
stimulate sensations of dizziness so your brain starts to get used to disruptive signals sent by your vestibular system and then ignores them
improve your balance and walking ability
improve your strength and fitness
The Brain and Spine Foundation is a UK charity that has more information about
vestibular rehabilitation
on its website.
You can ask your GP to refer you to a physiotherapist or you can pay for private treatment. If you decide to see a private physiotherapist, make sure they are fully qualified and a member of a recognised body, such as the
Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)
.
Not all physiotherapists have training in VRT, so you need to make it clear you require this type of treatment before making an appointment.
Complications of labyrinthitis
Permanent hearing loss can be a common complication of labyrinthitis, particularly in children who have developed bacterial labyrinthitis as a complication of the brain infection meningitis.
It’s estimated that as many as one in five children will develop hearing loss after having
meningitis
. The hearing loss can either be partial or complete.
Because of the high risk of hearing loss occurring after bacterial labyrinthitis, it is recommended that a person is given a hearing test once they have recovered from the infection.
Permanent, severe hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.

About kidney infections
A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys.
It’s more serious than
cystitis
, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.
If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn’t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn’t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.
Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.
Read more about the
symptoms of a kidney infection
When to see your GP
See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.
Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with
antibiotics
to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.
If you’re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection, for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip.
After taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.
In rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (
sepsis
) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess.
Read more about
treating a kidney infection
and the
complications of a kidney infection
What causes a kidney infection?
A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.
Read more about the
causes of a kidney infection
Who’s at risk?
Kidney infections are relatively rare. It’s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK.
They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are 6 times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman’s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.
Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.
Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.
Can kidney infections be prevented?
You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation.
Read more about
preventing a kidney infection
Symptoms of kidney infections
The symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days.
Common symptoms include:
pain and discomfort in your side, lower back or around your genitals
high temperature (it may reach 39.5C or 103.1F)
shivering or chills
feeling very weak or tired
loss of appetite
feeling sick or being sick
diarrhoea
You may have other symptoms if you also have
cystitis
or urethritis (an infection of the urethra). These additional symptoms may include:
pain or a burning sensation during urination
need to urinate frequently or urgently
feeling that you’re unable to urinate fully
blood in your urine
cloudy or foul smelling urine
pain in your lower abdomen
Children
Children with a kidney infection may also have additional symptoms, such as:
a lack of energy
irritability
poor feeding and/or vomiting
not growing at the expected rate
abdominal pain
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
blood in the urine
unpleasant smelling urine
bedwetting
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP if you have a high temperature, persistent pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Contact your GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.
If you have blood in your urine, you should always see your GP so the cause can be investigated.
Kidney infections require prompt treatment with
antibiotics
to help relieve symptoms and prevent
complications developing
.
Your GP can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection.
See
diagnosing kidney infections
for more information
Causes of kidney infections
A kidney infection happens when bacteria infects your kidneys. The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli, which live in your bowel.
The bacteria get in through the opening of the urethra and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.
It’s thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex.
In rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems.
Who’s most likely to get a kidney infection?
Women and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as
cystitis
.
In women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to enter the urethra accidentally. The female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). This makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys.
Other factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including:
having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as
kidney stones
or an
enlarged prostate
– children with
constipation
can also be at an increased risk
being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract
having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord – this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread
having a weakened immune system – for example, due to
type 2 diabetes
or as a side effect of
chemotherapy
having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis – the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys
having a urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine)
being female and sexually active – sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder
being a man who has anal sex – bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder
being pregnant – this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys
having undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) – an illegal practice where a woman’s genitals are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons
Diagnosing kidney infections
To work out if you have a kidney infection, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your recent medical history.
They will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure.
Urine test
A urine test can help to establish whether you have a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
. The test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if there are any bacteria in it.
You’ll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. If you do it at home, you’ll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. Ideally, hand it in to the surgery within four hours.
A urine test can’t tell whether the infection – if you have one – is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder.
For your GP to be confident you have a kidney infection, you need to have a positive urine test plus certain symptoms, such as a fever or a pain in your side.
Hospital scans
You may be referred to hospital for further testing if:
your symptoms fail to respond to treatment with antibiotics
your symptoms suddenly get worse
you have additional symptoms that aren’t usually associated with a kidney infection
you’re at risk of
complications of a kidney infection
Children with recurrent UTIs
will also be referred to hospital for further testing.
In these circumstances, scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems. This may include:
a
computer tomography (CT) scan
– where a scanner takes a series of X-rays and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed image of your urinary tract
an
ultrasound scan
– which uses sound waves to build an image of the inside of your body
an isotope scan – where a dye is injected into the bloodstream and a series of
X-rays
are taken

treating a kidney infection
Treating kidney infections
Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well.
See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.
All children with symptoms of a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
or kidney infection, including
cystitis
, should see their GP or out-of-hours emergency service.
Medication
Antibiotics
If you’re being treated at home, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between 7 and 14 days.
For most people – apart from pregnant women – antibiotics called ciprofloxacin or Co-amoxiclav are recommended. However, other antibiotics may also be used.
Common side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick and
diarrhoea
.
Co-amoxiclav can make the
contraceptive pill
and
contraceptive patches
less effective, so you may need to use another form of contraception during the course of treatment.
A 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women.
Usually, you’ll start to feel better quite soon after treatment starts and you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.
If your symptoms show no sign of improvement 24 hours after treatment starts, contact your GP for advice.
Painkillers
Taking a painkiller such as
paracetamol
should help relieve symptoms of pain and a high temperature.
However,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)
such as
ibuprofen
aren’t usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. This is because they may increase the risk of further kidney problems.
Self-help tips
If you have a kidney infection, try not to ‘hover’ over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in your bladder not being fully emptied.
It’s also important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent
dehydration
and will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. Aim to drink enough so that you’re frequently passing pale-coloured urine.
Make sure that you get plenty of rest. A kidney infection can be physically draining, even if you’re normally healthy and strong. It may take up to two weeks before you’re fit enough to return to work.
Treatment at hospital
Your GP may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections.
It’s standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. Only women who have had 2 or more kidney infections tend to be referred. Most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital.
Hospital treatment may also be needed if:
you’re
severely dehydrated
you’re
unable to swallow
or keep down any fluids or medications
you have additional symptoms that suggest you may have
blood poisoning
, such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness
you’re pregnant and you also have a high temperature
you’re particularly frail and your general health is poor
your symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics
you have a weakened immune system
you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a
kidney stone
or a
urinary catheter
you have diabetes
you’re over the age of 65
you have an underlying condition that affects the way your kidneys work, such as polycystic kidney disease or
chronic kidney disease
If you’re admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you’ll probably be attached to a drip so you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. Antibiotics can also be given through the drip.
You’ll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics are fighting off the infection.
Most people respond well to treatment. As long as there are no complications, they’re usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days. Treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving antibiotics through a drip.
Complications of kidney infections
Most kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems.
Complications of a kidney infection are rare, but you’re more likely to develop them if you:
are a child
are over 65
are pregnant
have
diabetes
,
chronic kidney disease
or
sickle cell anaemia
have had a
kidney transplant
(particularly in the first three months after the transplant)
have a weakened immune system
developed the kidney infection while in hospital
Kidney abscess
A kidney abscess is a rare, but serious, complication of a kidney infection, where pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney.
You’re thought to be most at risk of developing a kidney abscess if you have
diabetes
.
The symptoms of a kidney abscess are similar to those of a kidney infection. The most common are:
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
chills
abdominal pain
loss of appetite
pain when passing urine
Kidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of your body, such as your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal.
Smaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. Surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. This involves draining the pus out of the abscess using a needle that’s inserted into the kidney.
Blood poisoning
Blood poisoning (also called sepsis)
is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection. It happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. Once bacteria are in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs.
In someone with a kidney infection, the symptoms of blood poisoning include:
low blood pressure
, which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up
confusion or disorientation
excessive sweating
uncontrollable shaking or shivering
high temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36C, or 96.8F)
pale skin
rapid heartbeat
breathlessness
Blood poisoning is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection.
If you’re taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. This is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning.
Severe infection
Another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN).
EPN is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys.
The exact cause of EPN is unclear, but almost all cases are in people with diabetes.
The usual treatment is emergency surgery to remove some, or all, of the affected kidney. It’s possible to live a full and active life with only one kidney.
Kidney failure
In very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. This is when the kidneys stop working properly.
Kidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated with
dialysis
or a kidney transplant.
Other problems
A kidney infection can also cause other complications, including
high blood pressure (hypertension)
or premature labour or birth.
Preventing kidney infections
The best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria.
These self-help tips explain how you can do this.
Drink plenty of liquids
Drinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract.
Drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help prevent
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
. However, you should avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you’re taking
warfarin
, a medicine used to prevent blood clots. Cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there’s a risk of excessive bleeding.
Toilet tips
To help keep your urinary tract free from bacteria:
go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in
wipe from front to back after going to the toilet
practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex
empty your bladder after having sex
if you’re a woman, avoid ‘hovering’ over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladder
Treat constipation
Constipation
can increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), so try to treat any constipation promptly.
Recommended treatments for constipation include:
increasing the amount of fibre in your diet to 20g to 30g of fibre a day
using a mild
laxative
on a short-term basis
drinking plenty of fluids
See your GP if your symptoms don’t improve after 14 days (or 7 days for children with constipation).
Read more about
treating constipation
Be careful with contraceptives
If you keep getting UTIs (more than 3 a year is considered high), avoid using spermicide-coated
condoms
or
diaphragms
. This is because spermicide can stimulate the production of bacteria.
Stick to lubricated condoms without spermicide, because unlubricated ones can irritate the urethra and make it more vulnerable to infection."

About kidney stones
Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60.
They’re quite common, with around 3 in 20 men and up to 2 in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.
The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it’s known as renal colic.
Symptoms of kidney stones
Small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But it’s fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:
ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder
urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body
A blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
.
Read more about the
symptoms of kidney stones
.
What causes kidney stones?
The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.
This is more likely to happen if you don’t drink enough fluids, if you’re taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.
Read more about the
causes of kidney stones
.
After a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).
Treating and preventing kidney stones
Most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.
Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.
Read more about
treating kidney stones
.
It’s estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following 5 years.
To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you don’t become
dehydrated
. It’s very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones.
Read more about
preventing kidney stones
.
Symptoms of kidney stones
Very small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms. It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate.
Symptoms usually occur if the kidney stone:
gets stuck in your kidney
starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder) – the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can cause pain as they try to pass through
causes an infection
In these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include:
a persistent ache in the lower back, which is sometimes also felt in the groin – men may have pain in their testicles and scrotum
periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which may last for minutes or hours
feeling restless and unable to lie still
nausea (feeling sick)
needing to urinate more often than normal
pain when you urinate (dysuria)
blood in your urine (haematuria) – this may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter
Blocked ureter and kidney infection
A kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria.
The
symptoms of a kidney infection
are similar to symptoms of kidney stones, but may also include:
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
chills and shivering
feeling very weak or tired
diarrhoea
cloudy and bad-smelling urine
Read more about kidney infections
.
Causes of kidney stones
Kidney stones are usually formed following a build-up of certain chemicals in the body.
This build-up may be any of the following:
calcium
ammonia
uric acid – a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy
cysteine – an amino acid that helps to build protein
Certain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine.
You’re also more likely to develop kidney stones if you don’t drink enough fluids.
Recurrent kidney stones
Some people are particularly likely to keep on developing kidney stones, including people who:
eat a high-protein, low-fibre diet
are inactive or bed-bound
have a family history of kidney stones
have had several kidney or urinary infections
have had a kidney stone before, particularly if it was before you were 25
have only one fully working kidney
have had an intestinal bypass (surgery on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such as
Crohn’s disease
Medication
There’s evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. These include:
aspirin
antacids
diuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up)
certain
antibiotics
certain antiretroviral medication (used to treat
HIV
)
certain anti-epileptic medication
Types of kidney stones
Kidney stones can develop for a number of reasons.
Calcium stones
Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there’s too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to:
an inherited condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to large amounts of calcium in urine
an overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body)
kidney disease
a rare condition called sarcoidosis
some cancers
Calcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough.
Struvite stones
Struvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after a
urinary tract infection
that’s lasted a long time.
Struvite stones are more common in women than men.
Uric acid stones
Uric acid stones can form if there’s a large amount of acid in your urine. They may be caused by:
eating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat
a condition such as
gout
that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals
an inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body
chemotherapy
Cystine stones
Cystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. They’re caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine.
Diagnosing kidney stones
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history.
It will be particularly easy if you’ve had kidney stones before.
You may be given tests, including:
urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones
an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine
blood tests
to check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calcium
You can collect a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking.
Having a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier, and may help your GP determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you.
If you have severe pain that isn’t controlled by painkillers, or if you have a high temperature as well as pain, you may be referred to a urologist (a specialist in treating urinary problems).
Imaging tests
If you’re referred to hospital for an imaging test, a number of different techniques may be used. Imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis, or identify precisely where a kidney stone is.
These tests include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where a series of X-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together
X-ray
– an imaging technique that uses high-energy radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue
an
ultrasound scan
– uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body
an intravenous urogram (IVU) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) – a dye that shows up on X-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the X-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your urine
CT scans are now often used because they’re thought to be more accurate. IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method. The imaging technique you have may depend on what’s available at your local hospital.
Treating kidney stones
Most kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home.
But even small kidney stones can be painful, although this usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed.
Medication
If you are in severe pain, your GP can give you pain relief by injection. A second dose can be given after half an hour if you’re still experiencing pain.
Medication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. This is called an anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medication.
You may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home.
Self care
You may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking.
Give the stone to your GP so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need.
You should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. If your urine is yellow or brown, you’re not drinking enough.
Admission to hospital
If your kidney stone has moved into your ureter (the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder), and it’s causing severe pain, your GP may admit you to hospital for treatment.
This may be necessary if:
you’re at an increased risk of your kidneys failing (for example, because you only have one kidney)
your symptoms don’t improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti-sickness medication
you’re dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down
you’re pregnant
you’re over 60 years of age
Treating large kidney stones
If a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally – 6mm to 7mm (about 0.23in to 0.27in) in diameter or larger – you may need treatment to remove it another way.
This could include:
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
ureteroscopy
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
open surgery
The type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
ESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can’t be passed in the urine.
It involves using
ultrasound
(high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine.
ESWL can be an uncomfortable form of treatment, so it’s usually carried out after giving painkilling medication.
You may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones. ESWL is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter.
Ureteroscopy
If a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).
It involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body) and into your bladder. It’s then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck.
The surgeon may either try to gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine.
Ureteroscopy is carried out under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re unconscious), so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.
For stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50% to 80% of cases.
A plastic tube called a stent may need to be temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder.
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
PCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. It may also be used if ESWL isn’t suitable – for example, because the person being treated is obese.
PCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy.
PCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic, so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.
PCNL is 86% effective for stones that are 21mm to 30mm (0.8in to 1.2in) in diameter.
Open surgery
Nowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare. Less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery. It’s only usually used if there’s a very large stone or abnormal anatomy.
During open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. The kidney stone can then be removed.
Treating uric acid stones
If you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around 3 litres (just over 5 pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it.
Uric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they’re exposed to alkaline fluids.
You may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve.
Complications of treatment
Complications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones. Your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure.
Possible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones. Complications could include:
sepsis
– an infection that spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body
a blocked ureter – caused by stone fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder
an injury to the ureter
a
urinary tract infection
bleeding during surgery
pain
It’s estimated that 5% to 9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy.
Preventing kidney stones
The best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated.
Keeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones.
You can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour. The darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is.
Your urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight.
Drinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing.
You should also make sure you drink more when it’s hot or when you’re exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating.

preventing dehydration
.
Diet
If your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet.
Oxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone.
Foods that contain oxalates include:
beetroot
asparagus
rhubarb
chocolate
berries
leeks
parsley
celery
almonds, peanuts and cashew nuts
soy products
grains, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and wholewheat
Don’t reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your GP advises you to. This is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.
To avoid developing a uric acid stone, you should reduce the amount of meat, poultry and fish in your diet. You may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine.
Medication
If you have a kidney stone, medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing.
However, some medication may need to be reviewed by your GP if it’s thought to be causing your kidney stone.
The type of medication your GP prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have.
For example, if you have:
calcium stones – you may be prescribed a diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria (an inherited condition)
struvite stones – you may be prescribed
antibiotics
to help prevent a
urinary tract infection
or
kidney infection
, which are the main causes of struvite stones
uric acid stones – you may be prescribed allopurinol (a medication used to lower uric acid levels) and medication to help alkalise your urine
cystine stones – you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in your urine"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/liver-tumours/,"Liver tumours
Liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Boys are affected more commonly than girls.
There are 2 main types of primary liver cancer.
Hepatoblastoma
This usually occurs in children under 5 years old.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
This is rarer and usually occurs in older children.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
The liver
The liver is the largest organ in the body. It’s surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. It’s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs.
The liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. One of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. Some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. The liver also destroys harmful substances. It breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions).
The liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. It stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed.
The liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine).
The liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. This duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine.
The liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. It can function normally even if only a small part of it is working.
Causes
The cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children.
Children who are infected with hepatitis B have a higher risk of developing HCC in late childhood than uninfected children.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. Other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting).
How liver tumours are diagnosed
A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour.
An
ultrasound scan
and
X-rays
will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including
CT (computerised tomography) scans
or
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans
, will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver.
Blood tests
will also be carried out.
Most hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas produce a protein that is released into the bloodstream. This protein is known as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It’s possible to measure levels of AFP in the blood, which can be a useful indicator of whether the liver tumour is responding to treatment or whether it may have come back after treatment. AFP is also known as a tumour marker.
Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.
Grouping
To assess the extent of the cancer, a grouping system called PRETEXT (pre-treatment extent of disease) is used. It uses an MRI scan to measure the amount of cancer in the liver at diagnosis. It’s also used to help establish the best treatment for each child.
This grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world.
This grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. Grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. Grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not.
PRETEXT 1 – 1 liver sector is affected and the tumour can be removed by straightforward surgery
PRETEXT 2 – 2 adjoining sectors are affected and the tumour can be removed with more extensive surgery
PRETEXT 3 – 2 or 3 sectors are affected with no 2 adjoining sectors free of disease, and the tumour can be removed with major surgery
PRETEXT 4 – all 4 sectors of the liver are affected, and the tumour cannot be removed without replacing the liver with a donor liver transplant
Doctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver.
In the blood vessels
Sometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. This may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour.
In the abdomen
Sometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). The tumour cannot be removed completely.
In the lungs or other organs
If the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. About 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. Doctors use X-rays and CT or MRI scans to assess whether the lungs are affected.
Treatment
The diagnosis is made by taking a sample of cells from the tumour (
biopsy
). This is done under a general anaesthetic. Once the diagnosis and staging have been confirmed, plans for treatment will be made.
Hepatoblastoma
For hepatoblastoma, the type of treatment will depend on the PRETEXT staging and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease).
PRETEXT 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called ‘standard risk’. PRETEXT 4 is called ‘high risk’ and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.
Treatment is broadly similar for all PRETEXT stages. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) is given first. The aim of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumour in the liver and hopefully get rid of any metastatic tumours. Surgery to remove any of the remaining tumour will take place after a few weeks of chemotherapy. Further chemotherapy is usually given after surgery. Your child’s doctor will give you more detailed information about the chemotherapy drugs and their side effects.
Hepatocellular carcinoma
For hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment is a little different.
The role of chemotherapy is less certain and surgery is the main treatment. Doctors usually recommend removing the tumour (if it’s small enough) at diagnosis. Chemotherapy may be given afterwards. However in many situations the tumour is too large to remove at first, and so chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour so that surgery can be done later.
Hepatocellular tumours don’t always respond to chemotherapy as well as hepatoblastomas. For this reason, other treatments, such as chemoembolisation and targeted treatments, may be used.
Chemoembolisation
This refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. Very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer.
Targeted drugs
Targeted drugs are a group of treatments that work in a different way to conventional chemotherapy. Some drugs may cause cancer cells to die directly. Others act to cut off the blood supply to the tumour cells (antiangiogenesis drugs). Some drugs, called multi-targeted agents, work in both ways.
Research is looking into how useful targeted treatments are on their own and in combination with chemotherapy. Your child’s doctor may talk to you more about this research.
Surgery
All children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. If there’s cancer in the lungs, which hasn’t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. If the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later.
If the tumour involves all 4 sectors of the liver (PRETEXT 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. This is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. In a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person.
This will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. The transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. A liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Side effects can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
hair loss
an increased risk of infection
bruising and bleeding
tiredness
diarrhoea
Late side effects
The chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. These may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. There will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. Most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. Your child’s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.
Recurrence
If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as a recurrence. It can come back in the liver or in other parts of the body. If the cancer comes back, often (before anything is seen on scans) the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the child’s blood will start to rise again and reaches levels of over 100. Small rises in AFP can occur in the weeks after surgery, as the liver regenerates as much as it can.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
When the treatment ends, your child will have regular blood tests to measure the level of AFP in the blood (if appropriate), as well as scans and chest X-rays. More than three quarters of children with hepatoblastoma are cured, and for children with small tumours that are confined to the liver, the outlook is even better. The outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma is not quite as good. The staff at the hospital can give you information about the likely outcome for your child.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

About lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually develop within a few hours of consuming food or drink that contains lactose. They may include:
flatulence
(wind)
diarrhoea
bloated stomach
stomach cramps and pains
stomach rumbling
feeling sick
The severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you’ve consumed.
Some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.
When to seek medical advice
The symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet.
For example, the symptoms above can also be caused by:
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
– a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system
milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk
allergy
)
If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve.

diagnosing lactose intolerance
What causes lactose intolerance?
The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.
People with lactose intolerance don’t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it’s fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.
Depending on the underlying reason why the body isn’t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.
Read more about the
causes of lactose intolerance
Who’s affected?
In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent.
Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.
Is it an allergy?
Lactose intolerance isn’t the same as a milk or dairy allergy.
Food allergies
are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching.
If you’re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).
Treating lactose intolerance
There’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms.
Depending on what dairy products you’re able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice.
In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose.
Read more about
treating lactose intolerance
Complications of lactose intolerance
Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These
vitamins and minerals
are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.
If you’re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions:
Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis
– where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.
Malnutrition
– when the food you eat doesn’t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you’re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.
If you’re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.
Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The
British Dietetic Association
has information on how to find a private dietitian.
Causes of lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase.
Lactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that’s used to digest lactose.
If you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn’t produce enough lactase.
Digesting lactose
After eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it’s digested. The digested food then passes into your small intestine.
The lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. If there isn’t enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine).
Bacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such as
flatulence
and bloating.
Types of lactase deficiency
The main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below.
Primary lactase deficiency
Primary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. This type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families.
Primary lactase deficiency develops when your lactase production decreases as your diet becomes less reliant on milk and dairy products. This is usually after the age of two, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding has stopped, although the symptoms may not be noticeable until adulthood.
Secondary lactase deficiency
Secondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. It can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication.
Secondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the UK, particularly in babies and young children.
Possible causes of secondary lactase deficiency include:
gastroenteritis
– an infection of the stomach and intestines
coeliac disease
– a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten
Crohn’s disease
– a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system
ulcerative colitis
– a long-term condition that affects the large intestine
chemotherapy
– a cancer treatment
long courses of
antibiotics
The decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it’s caused by a long-term condition.
It’s also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. This is because your body’s production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older.
Congenital lactase deficiency
Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies.
It’s caused by an inherited genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase.
The genetic mutation responsible for congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on the condition.
Developmental lactase deficiency
Some babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn’t fully developed by the time they were born.
This is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as affected babies get older.
Diagnosing lactose intolerance
It’s important to visit your GP if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.
Before seeing your GP, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. Tell your GP if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to.
Your GP may suggest trying to remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. This will provide further evidence of whether you’re lactose intolerant.
Further testing
Other tests aren’t usually needed, but your GP may sometimes suggest further tests to:
help confirm the diagnosis
find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing
try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance
Some of the main tests that may be used are described below.
Hydrogen breath test
A hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant.
You’ll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. When you arrive for the test, you’ll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag. This sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm).
You’ll then be given a drink of lactose solution and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes.
If your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it’s likely that you’re lactose intolerant. This is because lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal.
Lactose tolerance test
In a lactose tolerance test, you’ll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains.
If you’re lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose.
Milk tolerance test
In a milk tolerance test, you’ll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels don’t rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant.
Small bowel biopsy
A small bowel biopsy is rarely used to diagnose lactose intolerance. However, it may be carried out to see if your symptoms are being caused by another condition, such as
coeliac disease
.
In a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that’s passed down your throat. This will be carried out under
local anaesthetic
, so it won’t hurt.
The sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. If it only contains a small amount of lactase, it’s likely you’re lactose intolerant. The sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease.
Treating lactose intolerance
There’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet.
Some cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by
gastroenteritis
, are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. Other cases, such as those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong.
Changing your diet
In most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance.
The exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. Some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose.
If you decide to experiment with what you can and can’t eat, make sure to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. This will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems.
Eating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain
vitamins and minerals
in your diet and increase your risk of complications. You’ll also need to make sure you’re getting enough nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements.
If you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your GP about your diet.
Milk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks.
You may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child’s, diet.
Sources of lactose
Some of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you’re lactose intolerant are described below.
Milk
A major source of lactose is milk, including cow’s milk, goat’s milk and sheep’s milk. Depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet.
For example:
you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal
some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities
you may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbed
If even a small amount of milk triggers your symptoms, there are some alternatives you can try, such as soya or rice milk (see below).
Dairy products
Other dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant.
Some dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them.
It’s worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they’re a good source of essential nutrients such as calcium.
Other foods and drinks
As well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose.
These include:
salad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise
biscuits
chocolate
boiled sweets
cakes
some types of bread and other baked goods
some breakfast cereals
packets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits
packets of instant potatoes and instant soup
some processed meats, such as sliced ham
Check the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients.
The lactose found in some foods won’t necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk products such as cheese, butter and cream.
Some ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don’t, such as lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. These ingredients don’t need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant.
Medication
Some prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and complementary medicines may contain a small amount of lactose. While this isn’t usually enough to trigger the symptoms of lactose intolerance in most people, it may cause problems if your intolerance is severe or you’re taking several different medicines.
If you need to start taking a new medication, check with your GP or pharmacist in case it contains lactose.
Lactose-free foods and drinks
There are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid.
Food and drinks that don’t usually contain lactose include:
soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses
milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato
foods which carry the ‘dairy-free’ or ‘suitable for vegans’ signs
carob bars
You can also buy cow’s milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). This means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you’re less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it.
Getting enough calcium
If you’re unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet. Calcium has several important functions, including:
helping build strong bones and teeth
regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat)
ensuring blood clots normally
Therefore, it’s a good idea to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as:
green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra
soya beans
tofu
nuts
bread and anything made with fortified flour
fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards)
You can also buy combined calcium and vitamin D supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health.
It’s important to check with your GP or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects.
Lactase substitutes
In addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain lactase substitutes. These are available from most health foods shops.
Lactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn’t producing, which can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily.
Lactase substitutes can either be added to milk or taken just before eating a meal containing lactose.
Lactose intolerance in children
If your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. This is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink.
If your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it’s important for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development.
In general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above).
For babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, soya formula isn’t recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby’s future physical and sexual development.
Breastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk.
For many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. After this point it’s safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.
Complications of lactose intolerance
Milk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. They contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as vitamins A, B12 and D.
Lactose is also important because it helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, including magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.
If you are lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions.
Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis
– where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.
Malnutrition
– when the food you eat does not give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you are malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.
If you are concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.
Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The
British Dietetic Association
has information on how to find a private dietitian."

There are more than 100 different types of liver disease, which together affect at least 2 million people in the UK.
The liver
The liver is the second largest organ in the body. It works hard, performing hundreds of complex functions, including:
fighting infections and illness
removing toxins (poisons), such as
alcohol
, from the body
controlling cholesterol levels
helping blood to clot (thicken)
releasing bile, a liquid that breaks down fats and aids digestion
Liver disease doesn’t usually cause any obvious signs or symptoms until it’s fairly advanced and the liver is damaged.
At this stage, possible symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss and jaundice.
Types of liver disease
Listed on this page are some specific types of liver disease. The links provide more detailed information about each type:
alcohol-related liver disease
– where the liver is damaged after years of alcohol misuse, this can lead to
cirrhosis
(scarring of the liver)
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
– a build-up of fat within liver cells, usually seen in overweight people or those who are obese
hepatitis – which is inflammation (swelling) of the liver caused by a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances such as alcohol
haemochromatosis – an inherited disorder where there’s a gradual build-up of iron in the body, usually around the liver
primary biliary cirrhosis – a rare, long-term type of liver disease that damages the bile ducts in the liver
All types of liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), not just alcohol-related liver disease.
Significant health problem
In the UK, liver disease is on the increase. The 3 main causes of liver disease are:
obesity
undiagnosed hepatitis infection
alcohol misuse
These causes of liver disease are all preventable.
Do
make sure you’re a healthy weight for your height
avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
take the appropriate measures to prevent getting hepatitis, such as getting vaccinated if you’re at risk"

About lung cancer
Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.
There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including:
a persistent cough
coughing up blood
persistent breathlessness
unexplained tiredness and weight loss
an ache or pain when breathing or coughing
You should speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.
Read more about the
symptoms of lung cancer
Types of lung cancer
Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer.
There are 2 main types of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:
non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma
small-cell lung cancer – a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer
The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.
Read more about
diagnosing lung cancer
Who’s affected
Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It’s rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74.
Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.

preventing lung cancer
Treating lung cancer
Treatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it’s spread and how good your general health is.
If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended.
If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health,
radiotherapy
to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead.
If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective,
chemotherapy
is usually used.

treating lung cancer
Symptoms of lung cancer
Symptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.
The main symptoms of lung cancer are:
a
cough
that doesn’t go away after 2 or 3 weeks
a long-standing cough that gets worse
persistent
chest infections
coughing up blood
an ache or pain when breathing or coughing
persistent
breathlessness
persistent tiredness or lack of energy
loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss
Less common symptoms of lung cancer include:
changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
difficulty swallowing
or pain when swallowing
wheezing
a hoarse voice
swelling of your face or neck
persistent chest or shoulder pain
If you have any of these, you should speak to your GP.

Causes of lung cancer
Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.
Smoking
Smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. It’s responsible for more than 85% of all cases.
Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can lead to the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).
If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.
While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as
oesophageal cancer
and
mouth cancer
. These products include:
cigars
pipe tobacco
snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)
chewing tobacco
Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco. While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.
It’s been estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.
Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.
Passive smoking
If you don’t smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.
For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.
Radon
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.
If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you’re a smoker.
Occupational exposure and pollution
Exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include:
arsenic
asbestos
beryllium
cadmium
coal and coke fumes
silica
nickel
Read more information about
asbestosis
and silicosis.
Research also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).

causes and risk factors for lung cancer
Diagnosing lung cancer
Speak to your GP if you have
symptoms of lung cancer
, such as breathlessness or a persistent cough.
Your GP will ask about your general health and what symptoms you’ve been experiencing. They may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out.
You may be asked to have a
blood test
to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as a
chest infection
.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published
guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancer
and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer.
Chest X-ray
A chest
X-ray
is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass.
However, chest X-rays can’t give a definitive diagnosis because they often can’t distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs).
If your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven’t already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do, what type it is and how much it’s spread.
CT scan
A
computerised tomography (CT) scan
is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body.
Before having a CT scan, you’ll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete.
PET-CT scan
A PET-CT scan (which stands for positron emission tomography-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage.
The PET-CT scan can show where there are active cancer cells. This can help with diagnosis and treatment.
Before having a PET-CT scan, you’ll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You’ll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30 to 60 minutes.
Bronchoscopy and biopsy
If the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you’ll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor or nurse to remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs.
During a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells (
biopsy
). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs.
The procedure may be uncomfortable, but you’ll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a
local anaesthetic
to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes.
Other types of biopsy
If you’re not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you’ve had one and the results weren’t clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin.
Percutaneous needle biopsy
A percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells.
The doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing.
Thoracoscopy
A thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples.
You’re likely to need a
general anaesthetic
before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests.
After a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out.
Mediastinoscopy
A mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum).
For this test, you’ll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest.
The tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They’ll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they’re usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to.
Staging
Once tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means for your treatment and whether it’s possible to completely cure the cancer.
Non-small-cell lung cancer
Non-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type) usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment.
Stage 1
The cancer is contained within the lung and hasn’t spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages:
stage 1A – the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches)
stage 1B – the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches)
Stage 2
Stage 2 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 2A and 2B.
In stage 2A lung cancer, either:
the tumour is 5 to 7cm
the tumour is less than 5cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes
In stage 2B lung cancer, either:
the tumour is larger than 7cm
the tumour is 5 to 7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes
the cancer hasn’t spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding muscles or tissue
the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus)
the cancer has caused the lung to collapse
there are multiple small tumours in the lung
Stage 3
Stage 3 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 3A and 3B.
In stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be:
the covering of the lung (the pleura)
the chest wall
the middle of the chest
other lymph nodes near the affected lung
In stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following:
lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones
another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel
Stage 4
In stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs.
Small-cell lung cancer
Small-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer.
Small-cell lung cancer only has 2 possible stages:
limited disease – the cancer has not spread beyond the lung
extensive disease – the cancer has spread beyond the lung
Cancer Research UK has further information on
types of lung cancer
.
Treating lung cancer
Treatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment.
This team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your specialist about this.
The type of treatment you’ll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including:
the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer)
the size and position of the cancer
how far advanced your cancer is (the stage)
your overall health
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.
The main treatment options include surgery,
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
. Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.
Your treatment plan
Your treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.
Non-small-cell lung cancer
If you have non-small-cell lung cancer that’s confined to one lung and you’re in good general health, you’ll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body.
If the cancer hasn’t spread too far but surgery isn’t possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy).
If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. If the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended.
In some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. Biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.
Small-cell lung cancer
Small-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. This can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms.
Surgery isn’t usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it’s diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Surgery
There are 3  types of lung cancer surgery:
lobectomy – where one or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed – your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung
pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed – this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung
wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung – this is usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer)
People are naturally concerned that they won’t be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it’s possible to breathe normally with 1 lung. However, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it’s likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.
Tests before surgery
Before surgery can take place, you’ll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include:
an
electrocardiogram (ECG)
– electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart
spirometry – you’ll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out
How it’s performed
Surgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision) in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it’s thought that the cancer may have spread to them.
In some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest on a monitor.
After the operation
You’ll probably be able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation.
After your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications.
When you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. Talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you.
Complications
As with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in 1 out in 5 cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer.
Complications of lung surgery can include:
inflammation or infection of the lung (
pneumonia
)
excessive bleeding
a blood clot in the leg (
deep vein thrombosis
), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism)
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer.
An intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn’t healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery.
Radiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy).
A type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PCI involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. It’s used as a preventative measure because there’s a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain.
The 3 main ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below:
conventional external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body
stereotactic radiotherapy – a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible
internal radiotherapy – a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung – a small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes
For lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it’s thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it’s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances.
Internal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.
Courses of treatment
A course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways.
Radical radiotherapy is usually given 5 days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10 to 15 minutes and the course usually lasts 4 to 7 weeks.
Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given 3 times a day for 12 days in a row.
For stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. People having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20 to 32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions.
Palliative radiotherapy usually only requires 1 to 5 sessions to control your symptoms.
Side effects
Side effects of radiotherapy to the chest include:
chest pain
fatigue
persistent
cough
that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about)
difficulties swallowing (dysphagia)
redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn
hair loss on your chest
Side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be:
given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery (this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial)
given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning
used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible
combined with radiotherapy
Chemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment.
The number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. Most people require four to 6 courses of treatment over 3 to 6 months.
Chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.
Side effects
Side effects of chemotherapy can include:
fatigue
nausea
vomiting
mouth ulcers
hair loss
These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell.
Other treatments
As well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer.
Biological therapies
Biological therapies are newer medications. They’re sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.
Examples of biological therapies include erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells.
Biological therapies are only suitable for people who have certain proteins in their cancerous cells. Your doctor may be able to request tests on a small sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments are likely to be suitable for you.
Radiofrequency ablation
Radiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage.
The doctor carrying out the treatment uses a
computerised tomography (CT) scanner
to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells.
The most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air.
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. This is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as:
breathing problems
a cough
coughing up blood
Cryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour.
Photodynamic therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. It can also be used to remove a tumour that’s blocking the airways.
Photodynamic therapy is carried out in 2 stages. Firstly, you’ll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light.
The next stage is carried out 24 to 72 hours later. A thin tube will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam.
Side effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. However, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.
Living with lung cancer
Breathlessness is common in people who have lung cancer, whether it is a symptom of the condition or a side effect of treatment.
In many cases, breathlessness can be improved with some simple measures such as:
breathing in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth (after treatment for lung cancer, you may see a physiotherapist, who can teach you some simple breathing exercises)
making daily activities easier – for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don’t need to regularly walk up and down the stairs
using a fan to direct cool air towards your face
eating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfuls
If measures like these aren’t enough to control your breathlessness, you may need further treatment. There are a number of medications that can help improve breathlessness. Home oxygen treatment may be an option in more severe cases.
If your breathlessness is caused by another condition, such as a chest infection or a fluid build-up around the lungs (a pleural effusion), treating this underlying cause may help your breathing.

Pain
Some people with lung cancer have pain, while others never have any. About 1 in 3 people who are treated for cancer experience some pain.
Pain isn’t related to the severity of the cancer – it varies from person to person. What causes cancer pain isn’t thoroughly understood, but there are ways of treating it so the pain can be controlled.
People with advanced lung cancer may need treatment for pain as their cancer progresses. This can be part of palliative care and is often provided by doctors, nurses and other members of the palliative care team. You can have palliative care at home, in hospital, in a hospice or other care centre.

Emotional effects and relationships
Having cancer can lead to a range of emotions. These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression.
People deal with serious problems in different ways. It’s hard to predict how living with cancer will affect you.
Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help you may put others at ease. But don’t feel shy about telling people that you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you need.
Read further information:
Macmillan: Cancer and your emotions
Talk to others
Your GP or specialist nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist phone helpline. Your GP practice will have information on these.
You may find it helpful to talk about your experience of lung cancer with others in a similar position at a local support group. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet other people who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and had treatment.
If you have feelings of
depression
, talk to your GP – they can provide advice and support.

Money and financial support
If you have to reduce or stop work because of cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support.
If you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you are entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer.
If you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
.
If you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
.
You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income.
It’s a good idea to find out early on what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.
Read further information:
GOV.UK: Carers and disability benefits
.
Macmillan Cancer Support: Money, finance and insurance
Palliative care
If you have a lot of symptoms caused by lung cancer, your GP and healthcare team will need to give you support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.
As your cancer progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your (and your carer’s) wishes. This includes whether you’d prefer to go to hospital, a hospice, or be looked after at home as you become progressively more ill.
It will take account of what services are available to you locally, what’s clinically advisable and your personal circumstances.

Preventing lung cancer
If you smoke, the best way to prevent lung cancer and other serious conditions is to stop smoking as soon as possible.
However long you have been smoking, it’s always worth quitting. Every year you don’t smoke decreases your risk of getting serious illnesses, such as lung cancer. After 10 years of not smoking, your chances of developing lung cancer falls to half that of someone who smokes.
Quit Your Way Scotland
can offer advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking.
Your GP or pharmacist can also give you help and advice about giving up smoking.
Diet
Research suggests that eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including at least 5 portions a day of fresh fruit and vegetables and plenty of whole grains, can reduce your risk of lung cancer, as well as other types of cancer and heart disease.
More about
eating well
Exercise
There’s strong evidence to suggest that regular exercise can lower the risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer.
Adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/leg-cramps/,"Leg cramps
Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition. They cause the muscles in your leg to suddenly become tight and painful.
Symptoms of leg cramps
A leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. It’s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle.
Cramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. This includes your feet and thighs. Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest.
During a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff.
After the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours.
Cramps often happen during the night when you’re sleeping.
When to get help
Leg cramps might be a sign of a more serious health condition.
Speak to your GP urgently if:
leg cramps last longer than 10 minutes and don’t get better when you start to move
leg cramps develop after you’ve come into contact with a substance like mercury, lead or dirt that gets in a cut
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Speak to your GP if:
your leg cramps are affecting your quality of life
you’re having frequent leg cramps
your leg cramps are interfering with your sleep
you also have numbness or swelling in your legs
your leg muscles are shrinking or becoming weaker
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your legs and feet. They may also ask if you have other symptoms, like numbness or swelling. This may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition.
In this case, you may need further tests, like
blood tests
and urine tests, to rule out other conditions.
Causes of leg cramps
The cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, there may be an underlying condition or identifiable cause (secondary leg cramps).
Idiopathic leg cramps
Idiopathic leg cramps may be caused by:
abnormal nerve activity during sleep
excessive strain placed on leg muscles, for example during exercise
a sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected muscles
Also, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older. This may explain why older people are particularly affected by leg cramps. Tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. If your tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp.
Secondary leg cramps
Secondary leg cramps are caused by an underlying condition or another identifiable cause like:
pregnancy – the extra weight of pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping
exercise – leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise
neurological conditions – for example,
motor neurone disease
or
peripheral neuropathy
liver disease
– if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles spasm
infection – some types of bacterial infection, like tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm
toxins – in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, like lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps
dehydration
– in some people, low levels of water in the body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle cramps
Treating leg cramps
Medication is usually only needed in persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise.
If you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms.
Leg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born.
Treating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. Your treatment plan may include using medications like muscle relaxants.
Medication
Certain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. If you develop leg cramps after starting a new medication, speak to your pharmacist.
Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless your GP or healthcare professional advises you to do so.
Stretches for leg cramps
Most cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes.
To stretch your calf muscles:
Stand with the front half of your feet on a step, with your heels hanging off the edge.
Slowly lower your heels so that they are below the level of the step.
Hold for a few seconds before lifting your heels back up to the starting position.
Repeat a number of times.
Preventing leg cramps
If you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency.
You might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night.
If you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards. Placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position.
If you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed. This will keep your feet in a relaxed position. It’ll help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing.
Keep your sheets and blankets loose."

About laryngitis
Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx (voice box). In most cases, it gets better without treatment in about a week.
Symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of two to three days. Common symptoms of laryngitis include:
hoarseness
difficulty speaking
sore throat
mild fever
irritating
cough
a constant need to clear your throat
The hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you’re ill and may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone.
In a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn’t common in adults but can occur in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes.
Laryngitis is often linked to another illness, such as a
cold
,
flu
, throat infection (
pharyngitis
) or
tonsillitis
, so you might also have other symptoms such as:
a
headache
swollen glands
runny nose
pain when swallowing
feeling tired and achy
When to seek medical help
As laryngitis often gets better quickly without treatment, you normally only need to see your GP if the symptoms are particularly severe or they last longer than two weeks.
You should seek immediate medical help if you or your child experience breathing difficulties.
If you see your GP, they’ll discuss the possible causes with you and may refer you for tests or to a specialist in hospital.
Read more about
diagnosing laryngitis
Why it happens
In most cases, laryngitis is caused by either:
a viral infection – such as a
cold
or
flu
, or
damage to your larynx – usually by straining your voice
In these cases, most of the symptoms usually pass within a week. This is known as acute laryngitis.
Laryngitis can occasionally have other causes, such as smoking,
alcohol misuse
or an
allergic reaction
, and the symptoms can last much longer. This is known as chronic laryngitis.
Read more about the
causes of laryngitis
How laryngitis is treated
Most cases of laryngitis get better without treatment within a week. To help your vocal cords heal, it’s important not to smoke, to avoid smoky environments, drink plenty of fluids (particularly water) and try to rest your voice as much as possible.
In some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. For example, if the symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, you may be able avoid the substance you’re allergic to, or take medication to help control your body’s response to the substance.
Read more about
treating laryngitis
Can laryngitis be prevented?
As laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it’s not always possible to prevent it.
However, you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by:
making sure you have the annual
flu vaccine
(if recommended by your GP)
practising good personal hygiene  – such as washing your hands before and after eating and after using the toilet
avoiding close contact with people who have respiratory infections, such as a cold or flu – particularly if you’re prone to laryngitis
avoiding irritants, such as smoke or dust – particularly if you have a
cold
or other respiratory tract infection
not smoking
not drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol consumption
not regularly clearing your throat – as this can irritate the larynx (try swallowing instead)
raising your head with pillows when you’re sleeping – to protect your larynx from any acid reflux from your stomach during sleep
not shouting or singing loudly or for long periods of time – it’s important for people who regularly use their voice excessively to receive proper training so they don’t damage their larynx
Causes of laryngitis
Laryngitis occurs when the larynx (voice box) becomes irritated and swollen. It’s usually caused by an infection or damage to the larynx.
Infection
Viral infections such as a
cold
or
flu
are the most common type of infection associated with acute laryngitis.
Rarer types of infection include:
bacterial infections – such as
diphtheria
fungal infections – such as
thrush
(candidiasis) or aspergillosis
People with weakened immune systems, caused by conditions such as
HIV
or as a result of
chemotherapy
or
steroid medication
, are thought to be most at risk from fungal laryngitis.
Laryngitis caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection is known as infectious laryngitis.
Damage to the larynx
Laryngitis is also often caused by straining your voice, such as speaking or singing for long periods or shouting and singing loudly.
Straining your voice can cause your vocal cords to vibrate at a faster rate than they should. This excessive vibration can damage the surface of your vocal cords, causing them to become inflamed.
Laryngitis caused by damage to the larynx is known as mechanical laryngitis.
Less common causes of mechanical laryngitis include:
direct trauma to the larynx – such as a blow to your throat, an accident or a sports injury
prolonged coughing
persistent and frequent clearing of your throat
Other causes
As well as infection and damage to the larynx, laryngitis can also be caused by:
smoking and
alcohol misuse
, which can dry out and irritate your larynx
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– when stomach acid leaks out of your stomach and up into your throat, where it can irritate your larynx
allergic reactions
to substances such as dust, fumes, chemicals and toxins
These causes are most often associated with long-term (chronic) laryngitis.
Diagnosing laryngitis
Laryngitis often gets better without treatment, so you don’t usually need to see your GP unless you have particularly severe or long-lasting symptoms.
If you see your GP with laryngitis, they’ll discuss with you what could be causing the condition, including:
overusing your voice
smoking
misusing alcohol
allergies
Your GP may refer you for
blood tests
and take a throat swab using a small cotton bud on a plastic shaft. This is to check for a possible viral, bacterial or fungal infection.
They may also examine your larynx using a mirror to look for redness or swelling.
Seeing a specialist
If your GP thinks you need to see a specialist, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for some of the tests described below.
Laryngoscopy
A laryngoscopy is a test that involves examining your larynx using a thin tube containing a camera and light source (endoscope), which can be passed into your throat through either your nose or mouth. This test allows your doctor to assess any damage to your larynx.
Laryngoscopies carried out through the nose are not painful, but it can be uncomfortable and the tube may trigger your gag reflex, which can make you feel like you want to be sick (it’s highly unlikely that you actually will be sick).
Local anaesthetic
can be used to numb your nose and throat, which should help reduce these feelings.
If you’re having persistent problems with your voice, you might be asked to talk or sing while your larynx is examined. This may help your doctor determine why you’re having problems with your voice.
For laryngoscopies carried out through the mouth,
general anaesthetic
is used. This means you’ll be asleep during the examination. You can often go home on the day you have this procedure, although an overnight stay in hospital is sometimes recommended.
Testing for laryngeal cancer
Your ENT specialist may also want to make sure your symptoms aren’t the result of
laryngeal cancer
.
Alcohol and tobacco are the two main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. The more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.
Laryngeal cancer is uncommon, but it’s important to confirm it or rule it out quickly because the sooner laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment will be.
Tests your ENT specialist may recommend to check for laryngeal cancer include:
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– a series of X-rays are taken and assembled by a computer into a more detailed 3D image of your throat
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed scans of the inside of your throat
biopsy
– where a sample of tissue is taken during a laryngoscopy to check for the presence of cancerous cells
Other tests
Other tests that may also be carried out include:
a skin allergy test to check whether you have an allergy to certain substances
chest and neck
X-ray
to check for any abnormalities, such as an unusual narrowing or swelling of your larynx
Treating laryngitis
In most cases, laryngitis gets better within a week without treatment. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or haven’t improved after two weeks.
Treatment at home
You may be able to help your recovery by:
not smoking and avoiding smoky, dry or dusty environments
drinking plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
– particularly water (avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks), even though swallowing may be painful
taking painkillers, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
– which may ease any associated pain, headaches and fever (children under the age of 16 shouldn’t take aspirin)
gargling with a mouthwash of warm, salty water or an over-the-counter solution, or sucking lozenges – this may help to soothe a
sore throat
using menthol inhalation and air humidifiers – which may soothe your airways and help keep them clear
avoiding speaking when possible and only speaking softly when you need to – but don’t whisper because this can put more strain on your larynx
Treating underlying causes
In some cases, it’s possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. For example:
bacterial infections (but not viral infections) can be treated with
antibiotics
if smoking or alcohol misuse is causing laryngitis,
stopping smoking
or cutting down how much you drink can help
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can be treated with medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces – see
treating GORD
for more information
if an allergy is causing laryngitis, you may be able to avoid the substance you’re allergic to or take antihistamines to control your body’s response to the substance – see
treating allergies
for more information
if straining your voice is causing laryngitis, you may benefit from vocal therapy (see below)
Vocal therapy is a type of speech and language therapy that involves studying how you use your voice and how this may contribute to your symptoms. You may be given information and advice about any changes you can make or voice exercises you can do to prevent further damage to your larynx."

About lichen planus
Lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.
Affected areas can include the:
arms, legs and trunk
mouth (oral lichen planus)
nails and scalp
vulva, vagina and penis
The exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. However, the condition isn’t infectious and doesn’t usually run in families. It can’t be passed on to other people, including sexual partners.
A GP can usually diagnose lichen planus by examining the rash and asking about your symptoms. Oral lichen planus is often diagnosed by a dentist during routine dental check-ups.
Lichen planus is an itchy rash that can occur anywhere on the body.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Who’s affected by lichen planus
Lichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population. It’s more common in adults over the age of 40.
Lichen planus of the skin affects men and women equally. However, oral lichen planus is more common in women. The mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus).
Treating lichen planus
There’s no single treatment that can cure lichen planus completely. However, treatments are available to help manage the symptoms and make living with it easier. For example,
steroid creams
or ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash.
Most cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6 to 9 months. The rash rarely lasts longer than 18 months. However, oral lichen planus and lichen planus that affects the genital area may be more persistent.
Read more about
how lichen planus is treated
.
Erosive lichen planus
Erosive lichen planus is a rare form of lichen planus that can last a long time. It causes painful ulcers to develop in the mouth and in the genital areas of both males and females.
In some cases, long-term erosive lichen planus can increase the chance of some types of
cancer
developing.
Read our page on
complications of lichen planus
for more information about erosive lichen planus.
Symptoms of lichen planus
The symptoms of lichen planus vary, depending on which area of the body is affected.
Areas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the:
skin
mouth
penis
vulva (external female sex organs) and vagina
Lichen planus causes symptoms like itchy skin and red, slightly raised, bumps.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Lichen planus of the skin
The symptoms of lichen planus of the skin are:
purple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham’s striae)
thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles – this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus
itchy skin
Lichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected.
Thickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits.
After the papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured.
Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)
The symptoms of oral lichen planus are:
a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks
red and white patches in the mouth
burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking
painful red gums
Mild cases of oral lichen planus don’t usually cause any pain or discomfort.
Lichen planus of the penis
The symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are:
purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans)
bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny
a non-itchy rash
Lichen planus of the vulva and vagina
The symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include:
soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva
the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour
if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful
if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form
scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina
a sticky yellow or green discharge, which may be bloodstained
the opening of the vagina can become narrowed
Other areas
Lichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including:
the nails – which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing
the scalp – red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent hair loss can occur
Causes of lichen planus
The cause of lichen planus is unknown.
It’s thought to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines.
Lichen planus isn’t infectious, doesn’t usually run in families and can’t be passed on to others.
Autoimmune reaction
The immune system protects your body against illness and infection by producing antibodies (proteins) that attack bacteria and viruses.
In people with lichen planus, it’s thought that the immune system becomes overactive, causing an excess amount of proteins to be produced, which inflame the skin. This is known as an autoimmune reaction and causes the
symptoms of lichen planus
.
Reaction to medication
A reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. For example:
gold injections – these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people with
arthritis
to help reduce inflammation and painful joints
antimalarial tablets – these help treat and prevent
malaria
(a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes)
Diagnosing lichen planus
Lichen planus is often diagnosed by a GP or dentist examining the affected area.
Lichen planus of the skin
Your GP may be able to make a diagnosis based on the characteristic rash. However, lichen planus can be mistaken for other skin conditions, such as
eczema
, which also causes the skin to become red, flaky and itchy.
If your doctor is unable to make a confident diagnosis by examining your skin, they may want to take a small skin sample (
biopsy
), which will be examined under a microscope.
If a skin biopsy is required, you’ll be given a
local anaesthetic
to numb the affected area so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.
Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)
A dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth.
A biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. A sample of mouth tissue will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope. As with lichen planus of the skin, you’ll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the pain.
Treating lichen planus
There’s no cure for lichen planus, so treatments aim to ease the symptoms and clear the rash. Mild lichen planus doesn’t require treatment.
Self-help
Below is some general self-help advice that can help ease your symptoms and prevent them getting worse.
Lichen planus of the skin
avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water instead
wash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo
use an emollient to moisturise your skin
Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)
avoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus
avoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread
avoid drinking alcohol, particularly spirits
if areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge
if possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste
avoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible
visit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy
Lichen planus of the genitals
avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream
use an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating
applying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin – wrap it in a clean tea towel before placing it on your body)
women should avoid wearing tights
Lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails
There are a number of medications and treatments that may be recommended for lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails. These are outlined below.
Corticosteroid creams and ointments
Corticosteroid creams and ointments contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often referred to as
topical corticosteroids
.
Topical corticosteroids help treat the swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have.
Treatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. This pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. Continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will gradually cause the skin to thin. The side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the:
type and severity of treatment being used
how long the treatment is used for
nature of the condition being treated
Potential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include:
redness or burning and stinging of the skin
skin rash
thinning of the skin (atrophy)
stretch marks (striae)
contact dermatitis – a condition that causes skin inflammation
excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis)
lightening of the skin
Always check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.
Corticosteroid tablets
Corticosteroid tablets
are sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren’t being effectively controlled with creams or ointments.
Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include:
increased appetite
weight gain
insomnia
fluid retention (inability to pass urine)
mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious
Other treatments
Other treatments recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below.
Antihistamines – these are often used to treat symptoms of
allergies
, such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that’s causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this.
Light treatment – there are 2 types of light treatment: ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). UVB is the most commonly used light treatment, but PUVA may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don’t respond to other types of treatment.
Acitretin – this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice.
Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)
Mild cases of oral lichen planus won’t need any treatment. In more severe cases, treatment includes:
a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier
corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges
a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth
In more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis.
It can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it’s recommended that you:
stop smoking
(if you smoke)
avoid drinking large amounts of
alcohol
have a
healthy, balanced diet
, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables
You should also maintain
good oral hygiene
by cleaning your teeth at least twice a day, and having regular
dental check-ups
, so that any problems with your teeth or mouth can be identified and treated early.
Other treatments
If corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that’s thought to cause lichen planus.
These types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. Depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus
topical immunomodulating agents (used to treat lichen planus of the skin) – treatments such as tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin
immunomodulating agents (used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) – these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus
These treatments can cause a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you.
You’ll also need to have regular
blood tests
while taking immunomodulating agents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.
Further information and support
You can find support and information from organisations like:
Changing Faces
– a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice
Complications of lichen planus
Complications of lichen planus may include discoloured skin and, in some cases, erosive lichen planus may develop into certain types of cancer.
Skin pigmentation
After the lichen planus rash has cleared up, the affected area of skin may be a different colour to what it was originally. There may be a brown or grey mark, which can sometimes last for months. This is known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and tends to be more noticeable in people with darker skin.
Erosive lichen planus
Erosive lichen planus is a long-lasting (chronic) form of lichen planus that causes painful ulcers to develop, as well as burning and discomfort in the genital areas of both male and females.
Occasionally, in around 2% of cases, long-term cases of erosive lichen planus can develop into certain types of
cancer
, such as:
mouth cancer
vulval cancer
penile cancer
Regularly examining yourself and being aware of any changes that occur will help you to identify any problems at an early stage. Pay close attention to ulcerated areas in your mouth or genitals that don’t heal and persist for a long time. Visit your GP immediately if you notice any changes that you’re concerned about.
You should also visit your dentist regularly to ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, and that any ulcers or patches that form in your mouth are examined and treated promptly. Depending on individual circumstances, dental check-ups for adults are recommended anywhere between every 3 to 24 months.

About lymphoedema
Lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.
Other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them.
Lymphoedema can get worse if it’s not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.

What causes lymphoedema?
Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues.
Abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema.
There are two main types of lymphoedema:
primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood
secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury,
cancer
treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement
Read more about the
causes of lymphoedema
Who is affected
A recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema.
Secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after
breast cancer
treatment.
Primary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people.
How lymphoedema is treated
There is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.
These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.

treating lymphoedema
and
preventing lymphoedema
Complications
The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection.
In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called
cellulitis
is commonly reported in people with the condition.
Read more about the
complications of lymphoedema
Symptoms of lymphoedema
The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.
At first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.
Other symptoms in an affected body part can include:
an aching, heavy feeling
difficulty with movement
repeated skin infections
the skin becoming hard and tight
folds developing in the skin
wart-like growths developing on the skin
a leakage of fluid through the skin
When these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.
If lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.
In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.
If lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for
breast cancer
, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.

causes of lymphoedema
When to seek medical advice
If you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for
cancer
, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. Speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns.
If you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your GP.

diagnosing lymphoedema
Causes of lymphoedema
There are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.
The main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below.
Primary lymphoedema
Primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body).
These “faulty” genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should.
Primary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.
Secondary lymphoedema
Secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system.
It can have a number of different causes. Some of the most common causes are explained below.
Surgical treatment of cancer
Cancer
cells can spread around the body through the lymphatic system, so part of the treatment for the condition can involve surgically removing sections of the lymphatic system potentially containing cancerous cells.
Although the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn’t always possible.
There is a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for:
breast cancer
melanoma skin cancer
gynaecological cancers – such as
cervical cancer
and
vulval cancer
genitourinary cancers – such as
prostate cancer
or
penile cancer
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue.
If it’s necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly.
Infections
In some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema.
Cellulitis
is a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred.
Another infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. This is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the UK.
Inflammation
Conditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include:
rheumatoid arthritis
– which causes pain and swelling in the joints
eczema
– which causes the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and cracked
Venous diseases
Venous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid.
Some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include:
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
– a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body
varicose veins
(swollen and enlarged veins) – where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure, and more fluid passes into the surrounding tissues
Obesity
People who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. It’s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them.
In these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference.
Trauma and injury
In a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. For example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising.
Immobility
Movement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. Therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling.
For example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema.
Diagnosing lymphoedema
If you’re being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you’ll be monitored for the condition afterwards. Otherwise, see your GP if you experience symptoms of swelling.
There are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the UK. Your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. A list of treatment centres near you is available from the Lymphoedema Support Network.
In many cases, it’s possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by:
asking about your symptoms and medical history
examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it’s enlarged
Further tests
Although not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. These tests are explained below.
Measuring limb volume
In some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. These may include:
a tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume
water displacement – where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb
perometry – infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volume
Bioimpedance testing
During a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. The electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. Changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue.
Imaging tests
Imaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. These include:
a lymphoscintigraph – you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body
an
ultrasound scan
– which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– which uses
X-rays
and a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodes
These scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue.
Treating lymphoedema
The recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT).
DLT is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. Although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema.
Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT)
There are four components to DLT:
compression bandages and garments – to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up
skin care – to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection
exercises – to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage
specialised massage techniques – known as manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling
Each of these components is described in more detail below.
DLT usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part.
This is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. During this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. This phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part.
You may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing.
Compression bandages and garments
Unlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. Instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid.
If you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. These will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb.
These may also be applied after a session of MLD, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. This use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging.
Velcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves.
You will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period.
Skin care
Taking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such as
cellulitis
.
Read our page on
preventing lymphoedema
for more skin care advice.
Movement and exercises
Your lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. They will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. This will be tailored to your requirements and ability.
Your plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking.
Massage
To begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – usually carried out by a specialist therapist – to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained.
Your lymphoedema therapist will also teach you a range of simpler massage techniques that you or your carer can use during the maintenance phase of treatment, to help keep the swelling down. These self-massage techniques are known as simple lymphatic drainage (SLD).
Surgery
In a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. There are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition:
the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking)
the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) – see below
the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system – for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis)
These treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental – particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis – and are not in widespread use.
Liposuction
Liposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. It can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size.
Once the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. However, NICE says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety.
Access to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).
Complications of lymphoedema
Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition.
These complications are explained below.
Cellulitis
Many people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes of
cellulitis
(also known as erysipelas). Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. Cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition.
Symptoms of cellulitis can include:
redness and a feeling of heat in the skin
pain in the affected area
a high temperature (fever)
chills
Cellulitis can usually be successfully treated with
antibiotics
, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.
In some cases, you may be provided with a short supply of antibiotic tablets to use as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis. Alternatively, you may be given a long-term course of antibiotics to take to prevent infection.
Psychological impact
Living with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of
depression
.
If you have been feeling particularly down for the last few months and you no longer take pleasure in the things you usually enjoy, you may be depressed. If this is the case, talk to your GP or members of your lymphoedema treatment team, because there are effective treatments for depression.
Talking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. The
Lymphoedema Support Network
offers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area.
Remember: if you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.

treating lymphoedema
Preventing lymphoedema
It’s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition.
If you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse.
Skin care
The part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. Any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection.
Skin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop.
You can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by:
not having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible
treating cuts and scratches immediately with an antiseptic cream
using insect repellents to prevent
insect bites
moisturising the skin daily to keep it supple – your GP can prescribe a suitable cream
avoiding very hot baths and showers – the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling
using sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) to prevent
sunburn
wearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected
using anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected
cutting your nails with nail clippers
seeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care – but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema
wearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected
using an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself
not wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellery
Contact your GP as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a possible skin infection, such as redness and a feeling of heat in the skin.
Healthy lifestyle
Adopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the condition if you already have it.
This includes:
eating a healthy diet
maintaining a healthy weight
exercising regularly"

About liver cancer
Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver.
This is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver.
The rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about
secondary liver cancer
.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of liver cancer are often vague and don’t appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage. They can include:
unexplained weight loss
loss of appetite
feeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small
feeling sick and vomiting
pain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy)
jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes)
itchy skin
feeling very tired and weak
Speak to your GP if you notice any of these symptoms. Although they are more likely to be the result of a more common condition, such as an infection, it’s best to have them checked.
You should also contact your GP if you have previously been diagnosed with a condition known to affect the liver, such as
cirrhosis
or a
hepatitis C
infection, and your health suddenly deteriorates.
What causes liver cancer?
The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but most cases are associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis can have a number of different causes, including drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years and having a long-term
hepatitis B
or
hepatitis C
viral infection.
It is also believed obesity and an unhealthy diet can increase the risk of liver cancer because this can lead to
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
.
By avoiding or cutting down on alcohol,
eating healthily
and
exercising regularly
, and taking steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B and C, you may be able to significantly reduce your chances of developing liver cancer.
Read more about the
causes of liver cancer
.
Who is affected?
Despite being a common type of cancer worldwide, liver cancer is relatively uncommon in the UK. However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.
The number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around 2 in every 3 cases affect men.
Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.
Diagnosis and screening
Liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.
However, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.
Having regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment is likely to be.
Read more about
diagnosing liver cancer
.
How liver cancer is treated
Treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. If diagnosed early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely.
Treatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include:
surgical resection – surgery to remove a section of liver
liver transplant
– where the liver is replaced with a donor’s liver
microwave or radiofrequency ablation – where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells
However, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. Most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed.
In these cases, treatments such as
chemotherapy
will be used to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort.
Read more about
treating liver cancer
.
Causes of liver cancer
The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called
cirrhosis
. This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions.
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
In cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person’s chances of developing the condition.
However, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can also develop liver cancer.
Common causes of cirrhosis
Heavy and harmful drinking
The liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver’s resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it.
Every time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
occurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver. It’s a common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people.
However, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation can scar the liver.
The exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with
obesity
and
type 2 diabetes
.
Hepatitis C
A long-term infection of
hepatitis C
can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.
Hepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most common ways this happens worldwide include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared.
If you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.
Early treatment of long-term hepatitis C with antiviral medication can prevent the liver from becoming scarred.
Other causes of cirrhosis
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B
is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids.
Like hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs.
It affects about 1 in every 200 people in the UK. Most of those infected were born in parts of the world where the hepatitis B virus is very common.
As with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time.
If you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.
Early treatment of long-term hepatitis B with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred.
Haemochromatosis
Haemochromatosis is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food.
The excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer.
Primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare and poorly understood liver condition.
One of the main functions of the liver is to create a fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts.
For reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, the bile ducts gradually become damaged. This eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.
Diagnosing liver cancer
For many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition.
If you visit your GP, they will ask about your symptoms, when they started, and when they are noticeable. They will also examine you.
If they feel you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist.
Surveillance for liver cancer
If you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening – known as surveillance – is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it.
Surveillance is usually carried out every 6 months and often involves:
ultrasound scans
– high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities
blood tests
– your blood is tested for a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is found in some people with liver cancer
Surveillance is usually recommended if you have
cirrhosis
(scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver cancer.
The potential benefits of surveillance should be discussed with you before you enter any screening programme.
Further testing
The tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened.
If these initial tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or multiple tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
The further tests include:
computerised tomography (CT) scans
– a series of X-rays of your liver are taken to give a more detailed three-dimensional image
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
– uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver
biopsy
– a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy) to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells
laparoscopy – a small incision is made in your abdomen under
general anaesthetic
(where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver
After these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition’s stage.
Staging liver cancer
Staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer.
Many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person’s condition.
This is because the length of time a person lives and how well they tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is.
One combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of 5 stages. These are:
stage 0 – the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function
stage A – a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function
stage B – there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected
stage C – any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body
stage D – where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen
Treating liver cancer
The treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. Treatment can include surgery and medication.
Cancer treatment teams
Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat liver cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
Your treatment plan
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the
stage
your liver cancer is at.
If your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The 3 main ways this can be achieved are:
removing the affected section of liver – known as a resection
having a liver transplant – an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one
using heat to kill cancerous cells – known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
If your cancer is at stage B or C, a cure is not usually possible. However, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. There is also a medication called sorafenib that can help prolong life.
If your cancer is at stage D when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving any symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.
Surgical resection
If damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection.
As the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver’s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe.
Whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your
cirrhosis
(scarring of the liver).
If a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a
general anaesthetic
, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain as it is carried out.
Most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.
Risks
Liver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery.
Possible complications of liver resection include:
infection at the site of the surgery
bleeding after the surgery
blood clots that develop in your legs – the medical term for this is
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
bile leaking from the liver – further surgery may be required to stop the leak
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly)
Liver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack.
Liver transplant
A liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy liver from a donor.
This is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications.
A liver transplant may be suitable for you if you:
only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter
have 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm)
have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for 6 months
If you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit.
If you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults.
In some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant.
The advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long.

Microwave or radiofrequency ablation
Microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter.
They can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases.
These treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. This heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink.
Similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result.
There are 3 main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out:
where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously)
where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen – ‘keyhole’ surgery (laparoscopy)
where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen – ‘open’ surgery
Continuous
ultrasound
or
computerised tomography (CT) scans
are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position.
Microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or
local anaesthetic
(where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated.
How long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between 1 and 3 hours in total. Most people need to stay overnight in hospital.
You may experience some minor discomfort and
flu
-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure.
The risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer.
A type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage B and C liver cancer. In these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer.
TACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant.
It is not recommended for stage D liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse.
TACE procedure
During TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery).
Chemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow.
TACE usually takes one to 2 hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home.
This procedure can be completed several times if necessary.
Side effects
Injecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness.
However, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick.
These symptoms may last for a few weeks after a TACE session.

chemotherapy
.
Alcohol injections
If you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment. A needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. This dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply.
In most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won’t feel any pain.
Sorafenib
Sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth.
It is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the NHS because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers.
Whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether you will significantly benefit from the medication.
For more information, see the
NICE guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
.
Advanced liver cancer
Treatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer.
Some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative.

About lupus
Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.
Types of lupus
There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.
However, the term “lupus” is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.
Symptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe.
Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life.
The rest of this article will focus on SLE.
Signs and symptoms
SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands
joint pain and swelling
As the symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.
If you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause.

What causes lupus?
SLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs.
As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in certain people.
Read more about the
causes of lupus
.
Who is affected
SLE is an uncommon condition where a
round 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages.
The condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin.
How lupus is treated
There is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage.
These medications include:
hydroxychloroquine – a medicine that has historically been used to treat
malaria
, but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE
corticosteroids
– anti-inflammatory medications
immunosuppressants – a group of medicines that suppress your immune system
With good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively.

Outlook
A few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed.
As a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.
However, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as
heart attack
or
stroke
. SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections.

complications of lupus
.
Symptoms of lupus
Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can vary widely from person to person. Some people may only experience a few mild symptoms, whereas others may be more severely affected.
Even if you usually have mild symptoms, SLE can “flare-up”, with symptoms becoming more severe or new symptoms developing.
Main symptoms
The 3 main symptoms of SLE are fatigue, joint pain and rashes.
Fatigue
Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of SLE. You may feel very tired even though you get plenty of sleep. Carrying out everyday tasks, such as housework or office work, can leave you feeling exhausted.
Many people with SLE find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of SLE because it has a negative impact on their work and social life.
Joint pain
If you have SLE, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. You may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning.
Unlike some other conditions that affect the joints, SLE is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed.
Rashes
Many people with SLE develop rashes on their skin – most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a “butterfly rash” or “malar rash”.
Rashes caused by SLE may get better after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent.
Rashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as “photosensitivity”.
Other symptoms
SLE can also cause a wide range of symptoms. However, you’re unlikely to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience the main symptoms.
Other features of SLE may include:
a fever (high temperature)
swollen lymph glands
(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin)
recurring
mouth ulcers
hair loss (alopecia)
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
headaches
and
migraines
stomach (abdominal) pain
chest pain
depression
dry eyes
memory loss
seizures (fits)
problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination (
psychosis
)
shortness of breath
Raynaud’s phenomenon a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet when it is cold
ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema)
When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE.
While it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis.

Causes of lupus
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.
The immune system is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it.
In cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs.
It’s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible.
Possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.
Genetic factors
Brothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large.
Researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become “scrambled”, resulting in the body’s processes not working normally.
Most faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction.
Environmental factors
A number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited.
Possible environmental factors that have been suggested include:
exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light)
hormonal changes that occur during a woman’s lifetime, such as during puberty or pregnancy
certain infections, such as by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – a common viral infection that doesn’t usually cause any symptoms
smoking
Diagnosing lupus
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions.
Diagnosis may also be difficult because symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. For example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe.
For a confident diagnosis of SLE to be made, you will need to have several
symptoms of lupus
and a number of
blood tests
may need to be carried out.
Blood tests
Some of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test
A blood test called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to determine whether there is any inflammation in your body.
This can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including the joints and internal organs.
The test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation.
Anti-nuclear antibody test
An anti-nuclear antibody test checks whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody.
However, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having SLE, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition. Other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Anti-DNA antibody test
An anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition.
The level of anti-DNA antibodies increases when SLE is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal.
Complement level test
Complement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system. The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active.
Other tests
Once you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular monitoring to see how the condition is affecting your body.
If you have SLE it is possible you may develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible.
You may need to have scans, such as an
X-ray
,
ultrasound scan,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
or a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs.

complications of lupus
.
Treating lupus
There is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available.
In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication.
Protecting yourself from the sun
Exposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it’s important to protect your skin when in the sun.
This means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions.
As people get most of their vitamin D as a result of direct sunlight on the skin, there is a risk you may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure. This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as
osteoporosis
(weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. If you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of SLE, you may be prescribed a NSAID to help ease your symptoms.
Commonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include
ibuprofen
, naproxen and diclofenac.
You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP.
NSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise about which NSAID is right for you.
Side effects
If taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding.
If you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach.
Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine is a medicine that has been used to treat
malaria
, but is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of SLE, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue.
You will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit.
Most expert doctors recommend people with SLE take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus.
Side effects
Side effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include
indigestion
,
diarrhoea
,
headaches
and rashes.
Hydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine.
If your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids
are a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. They can be very effective in treating symptoms of SLE, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe.
If you have severe symptoms of SLE, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. As your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced.
Side effects
When prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include:
thinning of your bones
thinning of your skin
weight gain
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
Corticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your GP or specialist. They will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition.
Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. They can help improve your symptoms of SLE by limiting the damage your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body.
Commonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide.
Immunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. Alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced.
Side effects
Immunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as:
loss of appetite
vomiting
diarrhoea
swollen gums
bruising or bleeding more easily
headache
acne
extra hair growth
weight gain
liver damage
an increased risk of infection (see below)
Methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used.
Tell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted.
Infection risk
Taking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening.
It is therefore very important to report any symptoms of a possible infection to your GP immediately.
Symptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of SLE and include:
a fever (high temperature)
a
cough
or
breathlessness
burning when passing urine or passing blood in your urine
diarrhoea
You should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection – even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as
chickenpox
or
measles
. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).
Rituximab
Rituximab is a new type of medication used in people with severe SLE that doesn’t respond to other treatments.
Rituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as
lymphoma
, but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as SLE and
rheumatoid arthritis
.
Rituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called “B-cells”, which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of SLE. It is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion.
Rituximab is not currently licensed for treating SLE in the UK, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE.
Side effects
Common side effects of rituximab include:
flu
-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature
dizziness
vomiting
In rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.
Belimumab
Belimumab is a new medication given to people with active SLE who don’t respond to other treatments.
It works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3 doses are given 14 days apart, and the medication is usually given once a month thereafter.
Belimumab is licensed for treating SLE in the UK, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE.
Side effects
Common side effects of belimumab include:
flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature
nausea and diarrhoea
headache
difficulty sleeping (
insomnia
)
a cough,
sore throat
and blocked or runny nose
joint pain
increased risk of infections
changes in blood pressure
In rare cases, belimumab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.
Complications of lupus
If your symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are mild or well-controlled, you may find it barely affects your day-to-day life and that you do not have any complications.
However, for some people, SLE can be a more serious condition that can cause life-threatening complications. Some of these complications are outlined below.
Kidney problems
Around 1 in every 3 people with SLE will develop a potentially serious kidney disease called lupus nephritis, which is caused by prolonged inflammation of the kidneys.
Lupus nephritis tends to develop relatively early in the course of SLE, usually within five years of diagnosis.
Symptoms of lupus nephritis can include:
swelling of your feet (oedema)
headaches
dizziness
blood in your urine
a frequent need to urinate
Lupus nephritis can also cause
high blood pressure
(hypertension). If left untreated, it can put you at risk of developing life-threatening problems such as a
heart attack
or
stroke
.
In many cases, lupus nephritis does not cause any noticeable symptoms. However, this does not mean the condition is not dangerous, as the kidneys could still be being damaged.
If you have SLE, it is likely you will need to have regular
blood tests
so the condition of your kidneys can be carefully monitored. If you develop lupus nephritis, it can usually be successfully controlled using immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.
In a small number of cases, the kidney damage can become severe enough to require treatment with
dialysis
(where a machine is used to replicates many of the kidneys’ functions) or a kidney transplant.
Cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
is a general term for any type of health condition that affects the heart and arteries. It is often associated with blood clots and atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries).
Examples of CVD include
coronary heart disease
,
angina
(chest pain caused by the heart not receiving enough blood), heart attack and stroke.
People with SLE are more likely to develop CVD than the general population, because SLE can cause your heart and arteries to become inflamed and damaged.
If you have SLE, you can reduce your risk of CVD by making health lifestyle chances, such as:
stopping smoking
if you smoke
eating a healthy, balanced diet
low in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and containing at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day
maintaining a healthy weight
exercising regularly
– at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) a week of exercise strenuous enough to leave you slightly out of breath is recommended
cutting down on your alcohol consumption
Pregnancy complications
SLE does not usually affect fertility, but it can increase your risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as:
pre-eclampsia
(a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy)
premature delivery
miscarriage
stillbirth
Some children of women with SLE can also be born with
heart block
(where electrical pulses that control the beating of the heart are disrupted) and rashes. This is known as “neonatal lupus syndrome”.
If you have SLE and are thinking of having a baby, it is best to plan this carefully with your doctors if possible. The risk of complications is higher if you become pregnant during periods where your symptoms are particularly severe, so you will usually be advised to try to avoid getting pregnant until your symptoms are better controlled.
If you do become pregnant, you will need to be monitored closely by your specialist and by an obstetrician, so they can check for any problems."

Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection. It’s caused by a strain of chlamydia bacteria.
LGV is rare in Scotland and is mostly
found in men who have sex with men
. LGV in women is very rare.
Symptoms of LGV
Most people with LGV don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:
swollen lymph glands in the groin (in one or both sides)
an ulcer or sore on the penis, vagina or around the anus
You may notice some anal symptoms such as:
blood or pus from the anus on underwear or toilet paper
pain in the anal area when pooing or having receptive anal sex
constipation, painful straining or
diarrhoea
when trying to poo
a feeling of incomplete emptying after pooing
Testing for LGV
If you think you might have LGV, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
What does the LGV test involve?
If you test positive for
chlamydia
, and your symptoms suggest that you might have LGV, the lab will do a further test for LGV.
The test for LGV is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. This can take up to 3 weeks.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:
using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed
Your partner (s) for the past 3 months should also be tested for LGV.
Treatment for LGV
Antibiotics will treat the LGV infection.
The result of the LGV test can take 3 weeks to come back, so your doctor may advise you to start treatment before the final result is available.
If left untreated, LGV can cause scarring and swelling of the skin. It can also cause permanent swelling of the genitals. Rectal infection can also cause swelling and scarring resulting in the risk of long-term bowel complications. Rarely the infection may spread via the bloodstream causing inflammation of the joints or liver.
To avoid passing LGV on to your partner(s) you should avoid having sex until both you and your partner have finished your treatment.
How LGV is passed on
You can get LGV by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom).
Your risk of getting LGV may be increased by:
chemsex
having group sex
fisting
sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
How to prevent LGV
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with LGV you should get tested for all STIs including:
gonorrhoea

Preventing and treating malaria
About malaria
Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn’t diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal.
A single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.
Symptoms of malaria
It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you’re travelling to areas where there’s a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.
Symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.
The initial symptoms of malaria include:
a high temperature (fever)
headache
sweats
chills
muscle aches or pains
vomiting and or diarrhoea
These symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.
When to seek medical attention
Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.
The effects of malaria are usually more severe in:
babies
young children
pregnant women
older people
Phone 111 or go to A&E if:
you or your child develop symptoms of malaria during or after a visit to an area where the disease is found, even if it has been several weeks, months or a year after you return from travelling
You must tell the healthcare professional that you have been in a country with a risk of malaria, including any brief stopovers.
What causes malaria?
Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.
All malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It’s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.
Types of malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum – mainly found in Africa, it’s the most common type of malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide, though treatment does cure the infection.
Plasmodium vivax – mainly found in Asia and South America, this parasite causes milder symptoms but it can stay in the liver for years which can result in symptoms reoccurring if it isn’t treated properly.
Plasmodium ovale – fairly uncommon and usually found in West Africa.
Plasmodium malariae – this is quite rare and usually only found in Africa.
Plasmodium knowlesi – this is very rare and found in parts of southeast Asia.
How malaria is spread
The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.
When a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person.
When an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.
Although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through
blood transfusions
and sharing needles.
Where is malaria found?
Malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.
The
fitfortravel
website has more information about the
risk of malaria in individual countries
.
Complications of malaria
Malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.
Anaemia
The destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe
anaemia
.
Anaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body’s muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.
Cerebral malaria
In rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.
Other complications
Other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:
liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes
shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure
pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
abnormally low blood sugar –
hypoglycaemia
kidney failure
swelling and rupturing of the spleen
dehydration
Malaria in pregnancy
If you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like:
premature birth
– birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy
low birth weight
restricted growth of the baby in the womb
stillbirth
miscarriage
death of the mother
Pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria.
Visit your GP, midwife, obstetrician or travel health advisor for a full discussion if you’re pregnant and are thinking of travelling to a high-risk area. Not all antimalarial tablets are safe in pregnancy and it’s important you get specific advice.
Preventing and treating malaria
If you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. It’s very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.
Preventing malaria
Malaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention, which stands for:
Awareness of risk – find out whether you’re at risk of getting malaria
Bite prevention – use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites
Check whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic – if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course
Diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling
Being aware of the risks
Check whether you’re travelling to a malaria risk area on the fitfortravel website
Visit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area.
If you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. This means you need to protect yourself from infection if you’re now travelling to a risk area, even if that’s where you grew up.

travel health and vaccinations

Preventing mosquito bites
Avoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. This is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite.
There are several steps you can take to avoid being bitten.
Do
mosquitoes can’t bite through clothing so wear light, loose-fitting clothing that will cover your arms and legs
apply insect repellent to all areas of your skin that are not covered by clothing, including your face and neck
remember to reapply insect repellent frequently
sleep under a mosquito net that’s been treated with an insecticide, or in a room with effective air conditioning
The most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (DEET). These are available in:
sprays
roll-ons
sticks
creams
There’s no evidence to suggest that other remedies protect against malaria, such as homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers,
vitamins B1 or B12
, garlic, yeast extract spread (Marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils.
Further information on mosquito bite prevention is available from the
fitfortravel
website.
Antimalarial tablets
Antimalarial tablets can help prevent you from developing a malaria infection. For the best protection, you must also follow mosquito bite prevention advice.
You must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. Antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area.
How long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used.
Antimalarial tablets don’t stop malaria from entering your body. However, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill.
If you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the UK) you could still become ill with malaria.
Taking antimalarial medication
You may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. This is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. If you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave.
Do
make sure you get the right antimalarial tablets before you go – visit a travel health clinic for advice on which is the best antimalarial for you
follow the instructions included with your tablets carefully
make sure you complete the full course of tablets
There’s currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria.
Types of antimalarial medication
The type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the following information:
where you’re going
any relevant family medical history
your medical history, including any allergies to medication
any medication you’re currently taking
any problems you’ve had with antimalarial medicines in the past
your age
whether you’re pregnant
If you’ve taken antimalarial medication in the past, don’t assume it’s suitable for future trips.
The type of antimalarial that you will need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes in an area. It will also depend on whether they’re resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication.
The main types of antimalarials used to prevent malaria are:
Atovaquone plus proguanil (also known as Maloff protect or Malarone)
Doxycycline (also known as Vibramycin-D)
Mefloquine (also known as Lariam)
To find out what type of antimalarial medication is best for you, visit your local travel clinic.
Treating malaria
If malaria is diagnosed and treated quickly, you should fully recover. Treatment should be started as soon as possible.
Treatment begins in a hospital to make sure complications don’t suddenly develop. Treatment is with tablets or capsules. If someone is very ill, treatment will be given through a drip into a vein in the arm (intravenously).
Treatment for malaria can leave you feeling very tired and weak for several weeks.
The type of medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on:
the type of malaria you have
the severity of your symptoms
whether you took preventative antimalarial tablets
your age
whether you’re pregnant"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/loss-of-libido/,"Loss of libido
Loss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to 1 in 5 men – and even more women – at some point in their life.
It’s often linked to professional and personal stress, or important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
However, an unexpected loss of libido – especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning – can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem, which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship.
If you’re concerned about your libido, especially if your diminished sex drive distresses you or affects your relationship, make an appointment to see your GP to discuss any underlying causes and possible medical or psychological treatments.
Doctors at your
nearest family planning clinic
, Integrated Sexual Health clinic, or Contraceptive and Sexual Health (CASH) clinic may also be able to help.
In the meantime, you may find the following information useful. It explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido.
Relationship problems
The first thing you should consider is whether you’re happy in your relationship. Do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire?
If you’ve been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive.
Relationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. For help and advice, you may find it useful to contact the relationship support charity
Relationships Scotland
.
Another thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. For example, many men experience ejaculation problems or
erectile dysfunction
, and women can experience painful sex or
vaginismus
(when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). See your GP if these problems are an issue, as they’re often treatable.
Your GP may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. This is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido.
Stress, anxiety and exhaustion
Stress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you’re constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice.
For more information and advice read about
beating stress at work
and
10 stress busters
Depression
Depression
is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It’s a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life.
You’re probably depressed if you’re feeling low or hopeless, or you’ve lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. In this case it’s really important to see your GP. They may feel you’ll benefit from
antidepressants
.
However, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. Speak to your GP if you’re already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication.
Drugs and alcohol
Drinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it’s a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you’re a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you’re a woman.
Read more about
alcohol misuse
and find out how to get
support for a drinking problem
.
Drug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. Read more about
drugs
for information and advice.
Getting older
Many people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication.
Older men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive.
Speak to your GP if you’re concerned about this. They may carry out a
blood test
to check your testosterone level and can tell you about treatments if your level is low.
As women start to approach the
menopause
, levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. Women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after a
hysterectomy
. Testosterone is another hormone that can affect sex drive.
Speak to your GP if you’re concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. They may be able to offer you a trial of
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
if it’s suitable for you.
Hormonal problems
Less commonly, low libido may be caused by an
underactive thyroid
. This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn’t produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.
An underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making. Learn more about
treating underactive thyroid
.
A hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. This is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood.
Contraception
Some women have reported a decreased sex drive while using some types of hormonal contraception, such as:
combined contraception, including the
combined pill
,
vaginal ring
, or
contraceptive patch
the progestogen-only pill
the contraceptive implant
the Depo-Provera injection
However, side effects of these contraceptives tend to improve within a few months and they’re generally well tolerated.
Speak to your GP or
local contraceptive (or family planning) clinic
if you’re worried your contraception is causing a loss of libido. They may suggest trying an alternative method.
Read more about
choosing a method of contraception
Other medical conditions
Long-term (chronic) medical conditions such as
cardiovascular disease
,
diabetes
and
obesity
can also have a negative effect on your libido.
Medication
Certain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as:
medication for high blood pressure
, including diuretics
medications for depression, including
SSRI antidepressants
medications for seizures (fits)
medications commonly used to treat
psychosis
(a mental condition where a person can’t distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions
medicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone
See your GP if you’re worried that medication you’re taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/measles/,"Measles
Measles is an infection that spreads very easily. It’s unpleasant and can sometimes have serious complications. Having the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
is the best way to prevent it.
Anyone can get measles if they haven’t been vaccinated or they haven’t had it before. It’s most common in young children.
Measles usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.
Symptoms of measles
The first symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you’re infected. These can include:
cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough
sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
watery eyes
swollen eyes
a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)
small greyish-white spots in the mouth
aches and pains
loss of appetite
tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy
The measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. The rash:
is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches
usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body
is slightly itchy for some people
Measles rash
Go to A&E or phone 999 if:
You or your child have measles and:
shortness of breath
a high temperature that does not come down after taking paracetamol or ibuprofen
is coughing up blood
drowsiness
confusion
fits (convulsions)
Phone your GP urgently if:
you think you or your child might have measles
you’ve been in close contact with someone who has measles and you’ve not been fully vaccinated (had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven’t had the infection before – even if you don’t have any symptoms
you’ve been in close contact with someone who has measles and you’re pregnant – measles can be serious in pregnancy
you have a weakened immune system and think you have measles or have been in close contact with someone with measles
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
You should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.
Is measles serious?
Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems.
Once you’ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again.
However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs
(pneumonia)
and brain (encephalitis).
How measles is spread
The measles virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.
People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about 4 days after the rash first appears.
How to prevent spreading measles to others
If you have measles:
stay off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears
regularly wash your hands with soap
use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze
avoid close contact with anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated
How measles can be prevented
Measles can be prevented by having the
MMR vaccine
.
This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.
You can be vaccinated at any age if you haven’t been fully vaccinated before.
If the MMR vaccine isn’t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you’re at immediate risk of catching measles.
Treatment for measles
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.
Do
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration
close the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity
use damp cotton wool to clean the eyes
In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment."

About meningitis
Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges).
It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults.
Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning
(septicaemia)
and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.
A number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis.
Symptoms of meningitis
Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:
a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F)
being sick
a
headache
a blotchy rash that doesn’t fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won’t always develop)
a stiff neck
a dislike of bright lights
drowsiness or unresponsiveness
seizures (fits)
These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear.
When to get medical help
You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you’re concerned that you or your child could have meningitis.
Trust your instincts and don’t wait until a rash develops.
Phone 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you think you or your child might be seriously ill.
Phone 111 or your GP practice for advice if you’re not sure if it’s anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis.
How meningitis is spread
Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis.
Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through:
sneezing
coughing
kissing
sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes
Meningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren’t ill themselves.
It can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common.
Read more about the
causes of meningitis
Vaccinations against meningitis
Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis.
These include the:
meningitis B vaccine – offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at 1 year
6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age
pneumococcal vaccine – offered to babies at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old
meningitis C vaccine – offered at 12 weeks of age, 1 year
MMR vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months
meningitis ACWY vaccine – offered to teenagers who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school. Young people who are in S4-S6 and missed the opportunity to get immunised last year, may also get the vaccine at school this year
Read more about the
meningitis vaccinations
Treatments for meningitis
People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.
Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week. Treatments include:
antibiotics
given directly into a vein
fluids given directly into a vein
oxygen through a face mask
Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime.
Read more about
how meningitis is treated
Outlook for meningitis
Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems.
Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious, long-term problems. These can include:
hearing loss
or vision loss, which may be partial or total
problems with memory and concentration
recurrent seizures
(epilepsy)
co-ordination, movement and balance problems
loss of limbs –
amputation
of affected limbs is sometimes necessary
Overall, it’s estimated that up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.
Read more about the
complications of meningitis
Causes of meningitis
Meningitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection.
Viral meningitis is the most common and least serious type. Bacterial meningitis is rare but can be very serious if not treated.
Several different viruses and bacteria can cause meningitis, including:
meningococcal bacteria – there are several different types, called A, B, C, W, X, Y and Z
pneumococcal bacteria
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria
enteroviruses – viruses that usually only cause a mild stomach infection
the
mumps
virus
the herpes simplex virus – a virus that usually causes
cold sores
or
genital herpes
A number of
meningitis vaccinations
provide protection against many of the infections that can cause meningitis.
How meningitis is spread
The viruses and bacteria that cause meningitis can be spread through:
sneezing
coughing
kissing
sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes
The infection is usually spread by people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat, but aren’t ill themselves.
The infection can also be spread by someone with meningitis, although this is less common.
It’s possible to get meningitis more than once.
Who’s most at risk?
Anyone can potentially get meningitis, but it’s more common in:
babies and young children
teenagers and young adults
elderly people
people with a weak immune system – for example, those with
HIV
and those having
chemotherapy
You can reduce the risk of getting meningitis by ensuring all your vaccinations are up-to-date.
Read more about
meningitis vaccinations
Treating meningitis
People with suspected meningitis will usually need to have tests in hospital and may need to stay in hospital for treatment.
Tests in hospital
Several tests may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.
These tests may include:
a physical examination to look for symptoms of meningitis
a
blood test
to check for bacteria or viruses
a lumbar puncture – where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
to check for any problems with the brain, such as swelling
As bacterial meningitis can be very serious, treatment with antibiotics will usually start before the diagnosis is confirmed and will be stopped later on if tests show the condition is being caused by a virus.
Treatment in hospital
Treatment in hospital is recommended in all cases of bacterial meningitis, as the condition can cause serious problems and requires close monitoring.
Severe viral meningitis may also be treated in hospital.
Treatments include:
antibiotics
given directly into a vein
fluids given directly into a vein to prevent
dehydration
oxygen through a face mask if there are any breathing difficulties
steroid medication
to help reduce any swelling around the brain, in some cases
People with meningitis may need to stay in hospital for a few days, and in certain cases, treatment may be needed for several weeks.
Even after going home, it may be a while before you feel completely back to normal.
Additional treatment and long-term support may also be required if any
complications of meningitis
occur, such as
hearing loss
.
Treatment at home
You’ll usually be able to go home from hospital if you or your child has mild meningitis and tests show it’s being caused by a viral infection.
This type of meningitis will normally get better on its own without causing any serious problems. Most people feel better within 7 to 10 days.
In the meantime, it can help to:
get plenty of rest
take painkillers for a
headache
or general aches
take anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medicine for any vomiting
Preventing the spread of infection
The risk of someone with meningitis spreading the infection to others is generally low. But if someone is thought to be at high risk of infection, they may be given a dose of antibiotics as a precautionary measure.
This may include anyone who has been in prolonged close contact with someone who developed meningitis, such as:
people living in the same house
pupils sharing a dormitory
a boyfriend or girlfriend
People who have only had brief contact with someone who developed meningitis won’t usually need to take antibiotics.
Complications of meningitis
Most people make a full recovery from meningitis, but it can sometimes cause serious, long-term problems and can be life threatening.
This is why it’s so important to get medical help as soon as possible if you think you or your child has
symptoms of meningitis
, and why
meningitis vaccinations
are offered to certain groups.
It’s estimated up to 1 person in every 2 or 3 who survives bacterial meningitis is left with 1 or more permanent problems.
Complications are much rarer after viral meningitis.
Main complications
Some of the most common complications associated with meningitis are:
hearing loss
, which may be partial or total – people who have had meningitis will usually have a hearing test after a few weeks to check for any problems
recurrent seizures
(epilepsy)
problems with memory and concentration
co-ordination, movement and balance problems
learning difficulties and behavioural problems
vision loss, which may be partial or total
loss of limbs – amputation is sometimes necessary to stop the infection spreading through the body and remove damaged tissue
bone and joint problems, such as
arthritis
kidney problems
Overall, it’s estimated up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.
Treatment and support
Additional treatment and long-term support may be required if you or your child experience complications of meningitis.
For example:
cochlear implants, which are small devices that are inserted into the ears to improve hearing, may be needed in cases of severe hearing loss – read more about treatment for hearing loss
prosthetic limbs and rehabilitation support may help if it was necessary to amputate any limbs – read more about recovering after an amputation
counselling and psychological support may help if the trauma of having meningitis causes problems such as disturbed sleep, bedwetting, or fear of doctors and hospitals
You may also find it useful to get in touch with organisations such as the
Meningitis Research Foundation
or
Meningitis Now
for support and advice about life after meningitis.
Preventing meningitis
Meningitis can be caused by a number of different infections, so several vaccinations offer some protection against it.
Children should receive most of these as part of the NHS vaccination schedule. Speak to your GP if you’re not sure whether your or your child’s vaccinations are up-to-date.
Meningitis B vaccine
The meningitis B vaccine offers protection against meningococcal group B bacteria, which are a common cause of meningitis in young children in the UK.
The vaccine is recommended for babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at one year.
6-in-1 vaccine
The 6-in-1 vaccine, also known as the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine, offers protection against diphtheria, tetanus,
whooping cough
, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and hepatitis B.
Hib are a type of bacteria that can cause meningitis.
The vaccine is given on three separate occasions when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old.
More about the 6-in-1 vaccine
Pneumococcal vaccine
The pneumococcal vaccine offers protection against serious infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria, including meningitis.
Babies receive the pneumococcal vaccine as 2 separate injections, at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old.
More about the pneumococcal vaccine
Hib/Men C vaccine
The meningitis C vaccine offers protection against a type of bacteria – meningococcal group C bacteria – that can cause meningitis.
Babies are offered a combined Hib/Men C vaccine at 1 year of age.
Teenagers and first-time university students are also offered vaccination against meningococcal group C bacteria as part of the combined meningitis ACWY vaccine.
More about the Hib/Men C vaccine
MMR vaccine
The MMR vaccine offers protection against
measles
,
mumps
and
rubella
. Meningitis can sometimes occur as a complication of these infections.
The vaccine is usually given to babies at 1 year of age. They’ll then have a second dose when they’re 3 years and 4 months old.
More about the MMR vaccine
Meningitis ACWY vaccine
The meningitis ACWY vaccines offers protection against 4 types of bacteria that can cause meningitis – meningococcal groups A, C, W and Y.
Young people who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school are advised to have the vaccination. Young people who are in S4 to S6 and missed the opportunity to get immunised last year, may also get the vaccine at school this year.

About malignant brain tumours
A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine.
Generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.
Most malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain.
These pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. For information about grade 1 or 2 tumours, read our pages on
low-grade (benign) brain tumours
.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.
Common symptoms include:
severe, persistent
headaches
seizures (fits)
persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness
mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality
progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems
Speak to your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it’s unlikely to be a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.

Types of malignant tumours
Most malignant brain tumours develop from the glial tissue, which supports the brain’s nerve cells. These tumours are known as gliomas.
Gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example:
an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain’s framework
an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves
an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain
It’s also possible to have a malignant tumour that’s a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain.
Who is affected
Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.
The exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it’s thought that certain genetic conditions and previous
radiotherapy
treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing.

How malignant brain tumours are treated
A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord.
Surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be followed by radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing.
However, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn’t usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life.

Living with a brain tumour
Living with a brain tumour is not easy. You may feel worried and anxious about what’s going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal.
It can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you’re closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you’re not sure about.
You can read more about living with a brain tumour on
The Brain Tumour Charity’s website
.
Your doctor may be able to refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such as
The Brain Tumour Charity
and
Brain Tumour Research
.
Support for carers
Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing.
Research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.
However, neglecting your own health doesn’t work in the long term. If you’re caring for someone else, it’s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It’s in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.

Symptoms of malignant brain tumours
The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.
When symptoms do occur, it is because the brain tumour is either putting pressure on the brain or preventing an area of the brain from functioning properly.
Signs of increased pressure on the brain
Common symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include:
severe, persistent
headaches
– which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing
persistent nausea and vomiting
drowsiness
vision problems – such as blurred vision, floaters and loss of vision that may come and go
seizures (fits) – which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one area
Symptoms caused by the position of a tumour
Different areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. For example, a tumour affecting:
the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell
the temporal lobe may cause forgetfulness, language problems (aphasia) and seizures
the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and numbness or weakness in one side of the body
the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side
the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck
the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (
dysphagia
)
When to speak to your GP
It’s important to speak to a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. While it’s unlikely that you have a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.

Causes of malignant brain tumours
Most malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. These are known as secondary tumours.
Cancers that can spread to the brain include
lung cancer
,
breast cancer
,
bowel cancer
and
melanoma skin cancer
.
Some primary malignant brain cancers (cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previously
benign brain tumour
becoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary tumour develops is unknown.
Age
Brain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. Most tumours affect people over 50 years of age.
Family history
People with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing a brain tumour themselves.
Radiotherapy
If your brain is exposed to radiation during
radiotherapy
, your risk of developing certain types of brain tumour later on is increased.
Genetic conditions
Some genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as:
neurofibromatosis type 1 or neurofibromatosis type 2
tuberous sclerosis
Turcot syndrome
Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
Gorlin syndrome
Unlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop in childhood or early adulthood.
Can mobile phones cause brain tumours?
There have been reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted by mobile phones. RF energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it.
However, it’s thought that the amount of RF energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature.
Research is underway to establish whether RF energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it’s unlikely mobile phones cause health problems.
Diagnosing malignant brain tumours
Speak to your GP if you develop any of the
symptoms of a malignant brain tumour
, such as a persistent and severe headache.
Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also carry out a simple neurological examination.
If they suspect you may have a tumour, or they are not sure what’s causing your symptoms, you’ll probably be referred to a neurologist (brain and nerve specialist).
Neurological examination
Your GP or neurologist may carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a brain tumour.
This may involve tests of your:
hand and limb strength
reflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex
hearing and vision
skin sensitivity
balance and co-ordination
memory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic)
A neurologist may also recommend one or more further tests.
Further tests
Other tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of X-rays
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves
an electroencephalogram (EEG) – where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalities
If a tumour is suspected, a
biopsy
(surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) may be taken to establish the type of tumour and the most effective treatment.
Under anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. You’ll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.
Treating malignant brain tumours
If you have a malignant brain tumour, you’ll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue.
The aim of this is to remove or destroy as much of the tumour as possible, ideally getting rid of the cancerous cells completely. However, this isn’t always possible and most malignant brain tumours will eventually return after treatment.
If your tumour does return after treatment, or you have a secondary brain tumour (where cancer has spread to your brain from another part of your body), a cure isn’t usually possible. Treatment can instead be used to control your symptoms and prolong life.
Your treatment plan
There are a number of different treatments for malignant brain tumours, and deciding on what you feel is the best treatment can be confusing.
A group of different specialists called a multidisciplinary team (MDT) will be involved in your care and will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions that you’d like to ask. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Surgery
Surgery will be recommended for most people with a malignant brain tumour. If the size or position of the tumour mean surgery is not possible, one or more of the treatments described below may be recommended instead.
The main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. You will be given a
general anaesthetic
so you are asleep while the procedure is carried out. An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.
The surgeon can then remove as much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws.
After surgery, treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any cancer cells left behind and reduce the risk of the tumour coming back.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
is a treatment where a beam of high-energy radiation is focused on the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. It can be used after surgery or as the main treatment for tumours that are difficult to remove.
Radiotherapy is usually given in several doses (fractions) spread over the course of a week. An entire course of treatment will usually last up to 6 weeks in total.
Possible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. Read more about the
side effects of radiotherapy
.
In a small number of cases, a similar treatment called proton beam therapy may be recommended. However, this is only suitable in very specific cases and currently, you’ll need to be referred for treatment abroad if your doctor thinks it’s appropriate.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a medication used to kill cancerous cells. It may be used alongside radiotherapy or on its own, either to help kill any cancerous cells left behind after surgery or to help relieve your symptoms when a cure is not possible.
Chemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as:
tablets (orally) – temozolomide and procarbazine are given in this way
injections into a vein (intravenously) – vincristine is given in this way
small, disc-like implants placed in the brain during surgery – carmustine can be given in this way, but is only recommended if 90% or more of the tumour has been removed
The side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you’re taking. Common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
For more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on
carmustine implants to treat gliomas
and
temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma
.
Radiosurgery
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
is a special type of radiotherapy that’s sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can’t be safely removed with surgery.
During the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour, usually in a single treatment session.
As the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells.
This means you’re less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. Recovery tends to be much faster and an overnight stay isn’t usually necessary.
However, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the UK and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour.
Treating symptoms
You may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may have as a result of your brain tumour.
These may include:
anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits)
corticosteroids
to reduce swelling and pressure in the brain
painkillers to treat
headaches
anti-emetics to prevent vomiting
Depending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery.
Choosing not to have treatment
If your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. This means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour.
In this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. Talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision.
If you decide not to have treatment, you will still be given
palliative care
, which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.
Recovering from malignant brain tumours
After being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.
Follow-up appointments
Malignant brain tumours often grow back after treatment, so regular follow-up appointments will be recommended to look for signs that this may have happened.
These appointments may include a discussion of any worrying new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and occasionally a brain scan.
You will usually have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop.
Supportive treatment
Problems caused by a brain tumour don’t always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated. For example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems.
In these cases, you may need extra support to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have. This may include therapies such as:
physiotherapy – to help with any movement problems you have
occupational therapy – to identify any problems you’re having with daily activities and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help
speech therapy – to help you with any communication or swallowing problems
Some people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. For more information, see the
service guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.
Driving and travelling
You may not be allowed to drive for a while after you’ve had a brain tumour. This will depend on things such as the type of brain tumour you had, where it was in the brain, and what symptoms you have.
If you are required to give up your driving licence and notify the
DVLA
, they will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again.
With up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle.
You can find out about
brain tumours and driving
on the Cancer Research UK website.
Flying is usually possible from 3 months after treatment.
Sports and activities
After you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.
Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for around 1 year after treatment, as there is a risk you could have an epileptic fit while in the water.
Sex and pregnancy
It’s safe to have sex after treatment for a brain tumour.
Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. If you’re planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.
Going back to work
You’ll usually tire more easily following treatment for a brain tumour.
You may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it’s probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to.
If you’ve experienced seizures, you shouldn’t work with machinery or at heights.
Emotional support
A brain tumour is often life-changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained. If it will help, your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker and counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.
There are also many organisations that can provide information and support, such as
The Brain Tumour Charity
and
Brain Tumour Research
.
Social support
If you have been diagnosed with a brain tumour, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. But there are other aspects of your life to think about and it is important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it.
If you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. Your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need.
Help you may need might include:
a care attendant, who can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break
a ‘meals on wheels’ service
income support, disability living allowance or attendance allowance
equipment and adaptations for your home

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/motor-neurone-disease-mnd/,"Motor neurone disease (MND)
Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND.
MND happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly and die prematurely. This is known as neurodegeneration.
Motor neurones control muscle activity like:
gripping
walking
speaking
swallowing
breathing
As MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities.
Symptoms of motor neurone disease
The symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.
Speak to your GP if:
you have early symptoms of MND
Being referred to a specialist as early as possible can help you access the right support.
There are usually 3 stages of symptoms.
Early symptoms
Sometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.
Limb-onset disease
In about two-thirds of people with MND, the first symptoms are in the arm or leg. This is sometimes called limb-onset disease. The symptoms include:
a weakened grip, which can cause problems picking up or holding objects
weakness at the shoulder, making lifting your arm above your head difficult
tripping up over your foot because of weakness at your ankle or hip
These symptoms are usually painless. You might also experience widespread twitching of the muscles (fasciculations) or muscle cramps. You might also see wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss.
Bulbar-onset disease
In 1 out of 4 cases, the first MND symptoms will affect the muscles used for speaking and swallowing.
These problems might initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. Increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of MND. It might be misdiagnosed as a
stroke
.
As the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia). This might be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat.
Respiratory-onset disease
In rare cases, MND starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. This is called respiratory-onset disease.
In some cases the initial symptoms like breathing difficulties and shortness of breath are more obvious.
You might suffer from a lack of sleep and a headache in the morning. This might be because your body isn’t getting rid of the carbon dioxide you normally breathe out.
Advanced symptoms
As MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.
Muscular symptoms
The limbs will become weaker. The muscles in the limbs may become thinner. As a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs.
The limbs may also become stiff. This is known as spasticity. Both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains.
Speaking and swallowing difficulties
Speaking and swallowing can become increasingly difficult as MND progresses.
Choking episodes can be distressing but they aren’t usually the cause of death.
Saliva problems
Reduced swallowing can cause excess saliva. This can cause drooling. Thicker saliva can sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat. This is because the muscles that control coughing become weak.
Excessive yawning
Some people with MND have episodes of uncontrollable excessive yawning. This can happen even when they’re not tired. It can sometimes cause jaw pain.
Emotional changes
MND can cause changes in your ability to control your emotions. This is more likely when there’s weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing.
One of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. This is sometimes called emotional lability or emotionality.
Changes to mental abilities
Sometimes, people with MND have significant difficulties with:
concentration
planning
communication
behavioural changes.
This is where the condition is causing a type of
dementia
(usually frontotemporal dementia).
Up to 15% of people with MND develop more profound frontotemporal dementia. This usually happens soon after, or sometimes before, their first muscle-related symptoms. Someone with MND might not be aware that there are problems with their behaviour or personality.
Breathing difficulties
Breathing might become less efficient as the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become more damaged.
This might mean you feel short of breath after doing every day tasks like walking up the stairs. Over time, you might become even more out of breath when you’re resting.
Shortness of breath can become a problem at night. Some people find it difficult to breathe when they’re lying down. Others might wake in the night because they feel breathless.
As breathlessness increases, breathing support can help reduce this symptom. This is usually given by non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support. It can be useful at night to improve your sleep quality. This can help reduce drowsiness during the day.
End-stage symptoms
As MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience:
increasing body paralysis, which means you’ll need help with most daily activities
significant shortness of breath
Eventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won’t be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it. Most people with MND become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where they usually die peacefully.
Secondary symptoms
Some people with MND have other symptoms that aren’t directly caused by the condition, but are related to the stress of living with it. These might include
depression
,
insomnia
and
anxiety
.
Causes of motor neurone disease
MND occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively fail. It’s not clear why this happens.
Genetic causes
One known cause of MND is an error in your genes with 20% of cases linked to genetic causes. Half of genetic cases will be in people who have a family history of MND. The other half of genetic cases will occur in those without a family history.
Having a family history of frontotemporal dementia can also increase the risk of inheriting MND.
The error in the gene affects the cells ability to perform normally and survive.
If you have a genetic form of MND, there’s a chance that you could pass the risk of developing MND on to your child. The risk of them developing the condition can be affected by many factors like age.
Not everyone who has the genetic mutation will develop MND in their lifetime. Typically, the longer you live, the more likely you are to develop the condition.
If you have a parent with MND with no other family history of the disease, you’re at a slight increased risk of MND of about 1.4%. The risk to the general population of MND is about 0.3%.
Other possible causes of motor neurone disease
It’s unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it’s a combination of factors that affect either the motor neurones or the cells that support them. There are some theories involving different cell processes including:
Aggregates and RNA processing
Aggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. They’re found in nearly all cases of MND and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones. It can also be a marker that the cell is under stress.
The protein TDP-43 is most commonly found in these aggregates. This is a protein involved in the processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as RNA. Mutations in the gene (TARDBP) coding for this protein can be a cause of genetic cases of MND.
Cell transport disruption
All cells have transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. Over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity and aging.
The body gets rid of the toxic waste by waste disposal systems that can be affected by ageing and the environment.
Glial cells
Glial cells surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients.
When they don’t work properly the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally.
Their involvement in MND is still being researched.
Glutamate
Nerve cells use special “messenger chemicals” called neurotransmitters to pass information between cells. One of the neurotransmitters is called glutamate. It excites neurones and one theory is that too much activity through this causes damage to the neurones.
Riluzole, a drug used to treat MND reduces the level of neuronal activity by blocking the action of Glutamate.
Mitochondria
Mitochondria are the “batteries” of cells. They provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. Mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with MND might not function properly.
Diagnosing motor neurone disease
Speak to your GP if you experience the initial symptoms of MND.
After hearing about your symptoms and an initial exam, your GP might refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).
Diagnosing MND can be difficult during the early stages. This is because many of the first symptoms can be caused by other more common health conditions like:
a trapped nerve – wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped under the spine
peripheral neuropathy
– where part of the nervous system is damaged by another condition, like
type 2 diabetes
swallowing difficulties caused by narrowing or inflammation of the gullet
speech difficulties due to problems with the voice box
damage to the brain by stroke or other neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) in younger people
Initial testing
MND is usually diagnosed by a neurologist based on the symptoms and a physical examination.
There’s no single test for MND. Various tests might be used to rule out other possible causes of the your symptoms. Tests might include:
blood tests
– these can be used for several reasons, like checking that organs are working, or to look for a marker of muscle damage (creatinine kinase)
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– to give a detailed picture of your brain and spinal cord
electromyography (EMG) – measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles
nerve conduction test – similar to an EMG but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal
lumbar puncture – a sample of spinal fluid might be tested to exclude an inflammatory or nerve condition caused by an infection
muscle
biopsy
– in rare cases, a small sample of muscle might be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the muscles
Gene tests
can be used to support the diagnosis in some individuals. They might provide an explanation of why they’ve developed the disorder. Your GP can give you more information about specialists who can help with genetic testing.
Confirming the diagnosis
There are many reasons why there may be delays in diagnosis. The initial symptoms might not appear to be serious. Or symptoms might not be recognised as being related to the nervous system so a neurologist isn’t consulted at first.
Sometimes, the diagnosis of MND is clear without the need for further tests. Confirming a diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming even for an experienced neurologist. They might need a period of observation to be sure, particularly in cases where the condition progresses slowly. MND can only be diagnosed if the symptoms are clearly getting worse (progressive).
Receiving the diagnosis
Being told you have MND can be devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first.
After you’re diagnosed you should be provided with contact details of an MND care specialist. These are healthcare professionals with specialist experience caring for people with MND. They’ll be able to give you (and your family) extra support after the diagnosis and during your time with the illness.
Talking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist might help with feelings of
depression
and
anxiety
.
It’s not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with MND go on to do this. You should discuss these thoughts with your doctor.
Taking
antidepressants
or medicines to reduce anxiety may help. Your care team will be able to tell you about this.
Treating motor neurone disease
Although there’s no cure for MND, there are treatments available to help relieve the symptoms.
A team of healthcare professionals will work together to help care for you. This multidisciplinary team typically includes:
a neurologist and an MND care specialist
a specialist in breathing (respiratory specialist)
physiotherapists to advise on mobility aids
occupational therapists to assess the need for adaptations to living environments
speech and language therapist to provide help with communication and swallowing
dieticians to support nutrition
As the conditions advances, you might also need palliative care.
Riluzole
Riluzole is the only licensed medication in the UK that’s shown a survival benefit for people with MND. Riluzole is thought to slow down the damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate.
In medical research, riluzole extended survival by 2 to 3 months on average.
Side effects of riluzole are usually mild and can include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat.
Very rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. If you’re prescribed riluzole you’ll need to have
blood tests
for the first few months to check your liver is working properly. If you’ve had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you.
Treating symptoms
There are treatments available that can help relieve many of the symptoms of MND and improve your quality of life.
Muscle cramps
Physiotherapy can help muscle cramps. In some cases, a medication called quinine can help treat muscle cramps too. They often improve later in the condition.
Quinine can cause side effects like:
hearing and vision problems
tinnitus
– the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head
vertigo
– a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving
Quinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.
Muscle stiffness
Muscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication like baclofen. This helps to help relax the muscles. Side effects can include increased weakness or tiredness.
Drooling
Medication is available to treat drooling of saliva. One option is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch.
Alternative medicines used to control drooling include:
amitriptyline
atropine eye drops applied to the tongue
glycopyrronium
botulinum toxin injections into the glands that produce saliva
Communication difficulties
Not everyone with MND will have significant speech problems.
There are ways to help people who find it hard to communicate. A speech and language therapist can teach you techniques to make your voice as clear as possible.
As the disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you communicate. A range of communication aids is available. Your therapist will be able to tell you about the most effective communication aids for you.
Swallowing difficulties
Not everyone with MND will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). For those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. This can lead to you feeling more tired. If food or fluid goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration).
One common treatment for dysphagia is a feeding tube known as a gastrostomy tube. The tube is surgically implanted into your stomach through a small cut on the surface of the stomach. It shouldn’t restrict your daily activities. You can continue to bathe and swim if you wish.
Ideally you should have the tube inserted before you become too frail. This is so you can get the best out of it and to give yourself the best chance of recovering from the procedure.
If you have thick secretions (fluids) you can’t cough up yourself, medicine like carbocisteine and acetylcysteine might help.
Breathing difficulties
As MND progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker. Your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough.
Breathing difficulties usually develop gradually. They’re sometimes the first sign of MND, although this is rare.
It’s important to discuss breathing problems with your GP before they occur. Your GP or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory (breathing) specialist or a palliative care specialist, depending on your needs.
You might benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) to support your breathing. Room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box. It’s filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time you take a breath.
NIV may not be suitable for everyone with MND. Your healthcare team will be able to discuss the options available to you.
Advance decision making
Many people with MND draw up an advance decision (sometimes called an advanced directive). This is where you decide your treatment preferences in advance in case you can’t communicate your decisions later because you’re too ill.
Issues that can be covered by an advance decision include:
whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of MND
the type of medication you’d be willing to take in certain circumstances
whether you’d be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid
if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function), whether you wish to have artificial resuscitation, like having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy)
whether you’d be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with MND are very important for ongoing research)
Your care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about making an advance decision.
Read more about end of life care
Research and drug trials
You might be given the opportunity to take part in research, including drug trials. Your MND care specialist and neurology consultant can provide further information on this.
Advice for carers
Caring for someone with MND can be both physically and emotionally demanding. It’s likely you’ll need a wide range of support.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/miscarriage/,"Miscarriage
A miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 24 weeks. Early miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Late miscarriages happen between 12 and 24 weeks.
Most of the time there’s no clear reason why it happens, but it’s very unlikely to be caused by anything you did or didn’t do.
About 1 out of 5 pregnancies miscarry. Since many miscarriages aren’t recorded the figure might be higher.
Always get medical help if:
you’re bleeding from your vagina
you’ve got strong, cramping pain
your waters break
your baby’s movements have changed, or you haven’t felt them move for a while
If you’re registered, contact your midwife or local maternity unit. If you’re not registered, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service.
What causes a miscarriage?
Doctors think most miscarriages are caused when the building blocks controlling the development of a baby (the chromosomes) aren’t right. Babies with too many or not enough chromosomes won’t develop properly. This leads to a miscarriage.
Miscarriages can also be caused by:
issues with your placenta
cervical weakness – when your cervix (neck of your womb) starts to open
Early miscarriages
An early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy.
Many women have a miscarriage before they even know they’re pregnant. If this happens it can feel like a late period with heavy bleeding.
Symptoms of an early miscarriage
You might be having an early miscarriage if:
you’re bleeding from your vagina
you’ve cramps in your lower abdomen – these can feel like bad period pains
there’s fluid or tissue coming from your vagina
your breasts are no longer tender and any morning sickness has passed
Bleeding
Having some light bleeding’s fairly common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a miscarriage.
If you start bleeding, you should always contact your GP or midwife and get advice about what to do.
What happens during an early miscarriage
If you’re in the early weeks of pregnancy:
you’ll probably be asked to go to the early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away
you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan
your body usually completes the miscarriage naturally
Depending on your stage of pregnancy, you may deliver a small baby. That can be a shock and is an understandably upsetting time.
Late miscarriages
A late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks.
For many parents who lose their baby after a late miscarriage, the word ‘miscarriage’ doesn’t properly express the impact of their loss. The loss of a baby at any time’s a terrible shock and a late miscarriage can be especially hard.
Symptoms of a late miscarriage
You might be having a late miscarriage if:
you’re bleeding from your vagina – this can be heavy and you might have blood clots
you’ve strong, cramping pains
Always get medical help if:
you’re bleeding
your baby’s movements have changed or you haven’t felt any movements for a while.
your waters break and your baby’s born very quickly
Contact your midwife or local maternity unit if you’re registered with them. If you’re not registered, contact your GP or phone the NHS 24 111 service.
What happens during a late miscarriage
If you’re later on in pregnancy:
you may be asked to go to the maternity ward
you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan
you’re likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour induced
While you deliver your baby you’re likely to have heavier bleeding and labour-like pains.
Making difficult decisions
If you’re having a miscarriage, your doctor or midwife will:
talk to you about what will happen next
help you, and your partner if you have one, decide what you’d like to do
You may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. Take your time. Your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby’s father and your family.
Get support from SANDS
Get support from SiMBA
After a miscarriage
Depending on your circumstances and stage of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor may ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby.
Some parents decide they don’t want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. This is a decision only you can make. It can be very hard when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Whatever you decide is okay.
If you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide.
If your symptoms continue
You’ll probably have some bleeding for a week or two. If you continue to have symptoms after your miscarriage, it may mean that some of the pregnancy tissue’s still in your womb.
Some women may need medicine or a short operation to treat this.
If you’re worried about seeking treatment, maybe a friend can come with you. Having support’s really important at this difficult time.
Taking time off work
Many women will want to take time off work after having a miscarriage.
If you have a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to:
take sick leave
any sick pay you’d normally qualify for
If you lose your baby after the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to:
take maternity leave
any maternity pay you qualify for
Speak to your employer about which choices may be right for you and your family.
Working Families has more about
your rights at work after a miscarriage
Repeated miscarriages
Most women go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby after a miscarriage. But unfortunately, some women have repeated miscarriages.
If you’ve had:
1 or 2 miscarriages – you’re not more likely than anyone else to have another one
3 or more miscarriages – your GP can refer you to a specialist to see whether there’s a specific cause"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/mesothelioma/,"Mesothelioma
Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body’s organs. It’s usually linked to asbestos exposure.
Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles.
Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60 to 80 and men are affected more commonly than women.
Unfortunately, it’s rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms.
Symptoms of mesothelioma
The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don’t appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.
Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include:
chest pain
shortness of breath
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night
a persistent
cough
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
clubbed (swollen) fingertips
Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include:
tummy pain
or swelling
feeling or being sick
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
diarrhoea
or
constipation
Speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past.
What causes mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction.
These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos.
The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.
Read more about
asbestos and people at risk of exposure
and
avoiding exposure to asbestos
.
How mesothelioma is diagnosed
If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.
A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including:
an
X-ray
of your chest or tummy
a computerised tomography (CT) scan
– a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body
fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed
a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or
anaesthetic
; a sample of tissue (
biopsy
) may be removed so it can be analysed
These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.
Treatments for mesothelioma
The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.
As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as
palliative or supportive care
.
Possible treatments include:
chemotherapy
– this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer
radiotherapy
– this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control
surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpful
You’ll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain.
Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/migraine/,"Migraine
Migraine is a common health condition. It affects around 1 in every 5 women and around 1 in every 15 men. They usually begin in early adulthood.
A migraine is usually a moderate or severe headache felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Many people also have symptoms like nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound.
There are several types of migraine, including:
migraine with aura – where there are warning signs before the migraine begins, like seeing flashing lights
migraine without aura – the most common type, where the migraine occurs without warning signs
migraine aura without headache, also known as silent migraine – where an aura or other migraine symptoms are experienced, without a headache
Some people have frequent migraines up to several times a week. Other people only have occasional migraines. It’s possible for years to pass between migraine attacks.
Symptoms of a migraine
The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.
The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation. The pain gets worse when you move and may prevent you from carrying out normal activities.
Other symptoms associated with a migraine include:
nausea
vomiting
increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room
Some people experience other symptoms, including:
sweating
poor concentration
feeling very hot or very cold
abdominal (tummy) pain
diarrhoea
dizziness (light headedness)
Not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms. Some people may experience them without having a
headache
.
The symptoms of a migraine usually last between 4 hours and 3 days. You may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.
Symptoms of aura
About 1 in 3 people with migraines have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine. These include:
visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots
numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue
difficulty speaking
Sometimes, you might also experience:
feeling dizzy or off balance
loss of consciousness – although this is unusual
Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour. The aura might start before the headache or you might experience it at the same time as a headache. Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.
Speak to your GP if:
you have frequent or severe migraine symptoms
Phone 999 if you or someone you’re with experiences:
paralysis or weakness in one or both arms and/or one side of the face
slurred or garbled speech
a sudden agonising headache resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before
headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision and a rash
These symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition, like a
stroke
or
meningitis
. You should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.
Causes of a migraine
The exact cause of migraines is unknown. They’re thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.
Around half of all people who experience migraines have a close relative with the condition. This suggests that genes may play a role.
Migraine triggers
It may help to keep a diary to see if you can identify a consistent trigger. It can be difficult to tell if something is a trigger or if what you’re experiencing is an early symptom of a migraine attack.
There might not always be a trigger for your headache.
Possible migraine triggers include:
Hormonal changes
Some women experience migraines around the time of their period. This might be because of changes in the levels of hormones like oestrogen around this time.
These types of migraines usually occur between 2 days before the start of your period to 3 days after. Some women only experience migraines around this time. This is known as pure menstrual migraine. Most women experience them at other times too. This is called menstrual related migraine.
Some women find their migraines become worse during perimenopause. However, they might improve or disappear a few years after your last period.
Emotional triggers
stress
anxiety
tension
shock
depression
excitement
Physical triggers
tiredness
poor quality sleep
shift work
poor posture
neck or shoulder tension
jet lag
fasting or low blood sugar (
hypoglycaemia
)
strenuous exercise, if you’re not used to it
Dietary triggers
missed, delayed or irregular meals
dehydration
alcohol
the food additive tyramine (found in some cheeses and cured meat)
caffeine products, such as tea and coffee
lack of caffeine (if you’re used to regular caffeine)
specific foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit and cheese
Some people crave chocolate before a migraine begins. This can be a sign that you’re about to have a migraine rather than the chocolate being the trigger for the migraine.
Environmental triggers
bright lights
flickering screens, such as a television or computer screen
smoking (or smoky rooms)
loud noises
strong smells
changes in weather (windy weather or stuffy atmosphere)
Medication
some types of sleeping tablets
the
combined contraceptive pill
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
, sometimes used to relieve symptoms of the menopause
There are other types of medications that can cause some people to experience migraines.
Speak to your GP if you start to experience migraines after starting to take new medication.
Diagnosing migraines
There’s no specific test to diagnose migraines. For an accurate diagnosis, your GP must identify a pattern of recurring headaches along with the associated symptoms.
Migraines can be unpredictable, sometimes occurring without the other symptoms. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time.
Your GP might do a physical examination and check your vision, co-ordination, reflexes and sensations. These will help rule out some other possible underlying causes of your symptoms.
Your GP may ask if your headaches are:
on one side of the head
a pulsating pain
severe enough to prevent you carrying out daily activities
made worse by physical activity or moving about
accompanied by nausea and vomiting
accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise
Migraine diary
To help with the diagnosis, it can be useful to keep a diary of your migraine attacks for a few weeks. Note down details like:
the date
time
what you were doing when the migraine began
how long the attack lasted
what symptoms you experienced
what medication you took (if any)
Taking too many painkillers is a reason why migraines can become difficult to treat. This is called medication overuse headache. Keep a record of what painkillers you take and how often you take them. You shouldn’t take painkillers on more than 10 days every month in the long-term.
It can be helpful to make a note when your start your period, if you have one. This can help your GP identify potential triggers.
Read more about
keeping a migraine diary
on The Migraine Trust website.
Referral to a specialist
Your GP may decide to refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system). They’ll do further assessments and offer treatment if:
a diagnosis is unclear
you experience significant migraines not controlled by your current treatment
Treating migraines
There’s no cure for migraines. There are treatments available to help reduce the symptoms. During an attack, many people find that sleeping or lying in a darkened room can also help.
It may take time to work out the best treatment for you. You may need to try different types or combinations of medicines before you find the most effective ones. If you can’t manage your migraines using over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe something stronger.
Always make sure you read the medication instructions and follow the dosage recommendations.
Children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin unless it’s under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
Aspirin and ibuprofen are not recommended for adults who have a history of stomach problems, like
stomach ulcers
, liver problems or kidney problems.
Painkillers
Many people find that over-the-counter painkillers, like
paracetamol
, aspirin or
ibuprofen
, can help to reduce their symptoms.
They tend to be most effective if taken at the first signs of a migraine attack. This gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms.
You shouldn’t wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers as it’s often too late for the medication to work. Soluble painkillers (tablets you dissolve in a glass of water) are a good option because they’re absorbed quickly by your body.
Taking too many painkillers can lead to medication overuse headache. You should not take them more than 15 days per month.
If you can’t swallow painkillers because of nausea or vomiting, you should speak to your GP about anti sickness medication or suppository options. Suppositories are capsules that you insert into the anus (back passage).
Opiates like codeine should not be prescribed as a treatment for migraines. They’re not any more effective than triptans and painkillers and can cause nausea and medication overuse headache.
Triptans
If over the counter medication is not helping your symptoms, your GP might recommend a triptan and/or anti sickness medication.
Triptan medicines are a specific painkiller for migraine headaches. They’re thought to work by reversing the changes in the brain that may cause migraine headaches.
Triptans are available as tablets, injections and nasal sprays.
Common side effects of triptans include:
warm-sensations
tightness
tingling
flushing and light headedness
feelings of heaviness in the face, throat, limbs or chest
Some people also experience nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness. These side effects are usually mild and improve on their own.
Taking too many triptans can lead to medication overuse headache. You should not take them more than 10 days per month.
Your GP will usually recommend having a follow-up appointment once you’ve finished your first course of treatment. This is so you can discuss their effectiveness and whether you had any side effects.
If treatment is not effective or causes unpleasant side effects, your GP may try prescribing a different type of triptan. Everyone reacts differently to each type of triptan.
Triptans can be taken at the same as painkillers and/or anti-sickness tablets to improve their effectiveness. Your GP will discuss this with you.
Anti-sickness medicines
Anti-sickness medicines, known as anti-emetics, can treat migraine in some people. They can be effective even if you don’t experience nausea or vomiting. They can be taken alongside painkillers and triptans.
Anti-sickness medicines work better if taken as soon as your migraine symptoms begin. They usually come in the form of a tablet.
Side effects of anti-emetics include drowsiness and
diarrhoea
.
Some anti-sickness medication can cause involuntary movements, normally in the face. Speak to your GP if you experience involuntary movements.
Combination medicines
You can buy some combination medicines for migraine without a prescription at your local pharmacy. These medicines contain both painkillers and anti-sickness medicines. If you’re not sure which one is best for you, ask your pharmacist.
It can also be very effective to combine a triptan with another painkiller, like ibuprofen.
Many people find combination medicines convenient. However, the dose of painkillers or anti-sickness medicine may not be enough to relieve your symptoms. If this is the case, it may be better to take painkillers and anti-sickness medicines separately. This allows you to control the doses of each.
Opiates like codeine should not be prescribed as a treatment for migraines. They’re not any more effective than triptans and painkillers and can cause nausea and medication overuse headache.
Treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding
In general, migraine treatment with medicines should be limited as much as possible when you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Instead, trying to identify and avoid potential migraine triggers is recommended.
If medication is essential, paracetamol and sumatriptan are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding.
If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, speak to your GP or midwife:
if you’re getting regular migraines
before taking medication
High doses of aspirin should not be taken to treat headaches during pregnancy.
Preventing migraines
It’s important to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle, including:
regular exercise, sleep and meals
ensuring you stay well hydrated
limiting your intake of caffeine
limiting your intake of alcohol
One of the best ways of preventing migraines is recognising the things that trigger an attack and trying to avoid them.
Preventative medication
Medication is available to help prevent migraines. These medicines are usually used if your migraines remain frequent (more than 1 migraine per week) following a period of avoiding possible triggers.
The following medications can be prescribed by your GP. If they’re not effective, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. The neurologist will consider what advanced therapies might be best to try next.
Medications used to prevent migraines are taken every day to reduce the severity and frequency of headaches. It takes a few weeks to reach the right dose and you might need to take it for several weeks (usually 8 weeks once the right dose is reached) to find out if it works.
Propranolol
Propranolol is a medication used to treat
angina
and
high blood pressure.
It’s also effective in preventing migraines. It is taken every day in tablet form, regardless of whether you have a headache or not.
Propranolol is not suitable for people with
asthma
,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and some heart problems. It should be used with caution in people with
diabetes
.
Side effects of propranolol can include:
cold hands and feet
pins and needles
problems sleeping
tiredness
light headedness
Tricyclic antidepressants
You might be prescribed tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline. This is a type of medication used for depression but at lower doses can also help prevent migraines.
The side effects can include:
drowsiness
a dry mouth
weight gain
difficulty passing urine
Topiramate
Topiramate is a type of medication originally developed to prevent seizures in people with
epilepsy
. It’s now much more commonly used in migraine. It’s been shown to help prevent migraines. It is taken every day in tablet form regardless of whether you have a headache or not.
Topiramate should be used with caution in people with kidney stones, liver problems or glaucoma.
You should not take topiramate during pregnancy as it can harm your unborn baby. You must be on an effective form of contraception when taking topiramate. Topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Your GP should discuss alternative methods of contraception if you’re prescribed topiramate.
Side effects of topiramate can include:
decreased appetite and weight loss
nausea and vomiting
constipation
or
diarrhoea
tingling sensation
memory problems and difficulty finding words
problems sleeping
Candesartan
You might be prescribed Candesartan. Candesartan is a medication used for high blood pressure.
Candesartan can cause lightheadedness due to low blood pressure, tiredness and cough. It should not be used if you’re pregnant or trying for a baby.
Other oral preventive medications
Other less common options of oral preventative medications for migraine include:
pizotifen
flunarizine
Complementary therapies and supplements
There are some complementary therapies and supplements which might help to prevent your migraine symptoms. These include:
magnesium
vitamin B2 (rivoflavin)
coenzyme Q10
acupuncture
You should discuss any complementary therapies you’d like to try with your GP.
Medical devices
There are some devices that have been developed that might help treat migraines. These include:
transcranial magnetic stimulation
external trigeminal nerve stimulator
non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation
Read more about medical devices
Advanced therapies for migraine
The following medicines are advanced therapies for migraine that can only be prescribed by a neurologist.
Botulinum toxin type A
Botulinum toxin type A is used to prevent headaches in some adults with chronic migraines. Chronic migraines mean you have headaches more than 15 days per month and at least half of them are migraines, over a period of 3 months.
Botulinum toxin type A is a type of neurotoxin (nerve toxin) that paralyses muscles. It’s not exactly clear why this treatment can be effective for migraine.
SIGN recommend this treatment as an option for people who have chronic migraine that hasn’t responded to at least three previous preventative medical treatments.
Botulinum toxin type A should be injected to between 31 and 39 sites around the head and back of the neck. A new course of treatment can be given every 12 weeks.
Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies
CGRP might be prescribed if other medication has not prevented your migraines.
This medication has been created specifically for migraines.
CGRP monoclonal antibodies are given by an injection into the skin on your thigh or abdomen (tummy) once per month. You’ll have to self administer this treatment meaning you’ll need to learn how to deliver the injection yourself.
Read more about CGRP
Preventing menstrual-related migraines
Menstrual-related migraines usually occur between 2 days before the start of your period to 3 days after. They can be preventable using either non-hormonal or hormonal treatments.
Non-hormonal treatments
The non-hormonal treatments that are recommended are:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
– a common type of painkiller (usually naproxen)
triptans – a type of medication used to treat a migraine attack (usually naratriptan or frovatriptan)
These medications are taken as tablets 2 to 4 times a day from either the start of your period or 2 days before, until the last day of bleeding.
Hormonal treatments
Hormonal treatments that may be recommended include:
combined hormonal contraceptives, like the
combined contraceptive pill
,
patch
or
vaginal ring
(usually taken continuously for at least 3 months)
progesterone-only contraceptives, such as
progesterone-only pills
,
implants
or
injections
oestrogen patches or gels, which can be used from 3 days before the start of your period and continued for 7 days
Hormonal contraceptives like the combined contraceptive pill or vaginal ring are not used if you have migraines with aura symptoms. This is because this can increase your risk of having a
stroke
.
Migraine clinic
If the treatments above aren’t controlling your migraines, you might be referred to a specialist migraine clinic for further investigation and treatment.
A specialist might recommend other treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation devices or greater occipital nerve blocks.
Complications of migraines
Migraines are linked to a very small increased risk of mental health problems. Migraines with aura are associated with a small increased risk of ischaemic strokes.
Stroke
An ischaemic
stroke
occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or fatty material in the arteries.
People who experience migraines with aura have about twice the risk of having an ischaemic stroke compared to people without migraines. However, this risk is still small. The risk increases significantly if you smoke and take the combined contraceptive pill.
It’s unclear why ischaemic strokes are linked to migraine.
Contraceptive pill
The risk of having an ischaemic stroke is increased by the use of the
combined contraceptive pill
. Medical professionals generally advise women who experience migraine with aura not to use the combined contraceptive pill.
Women who have migraine without aura can usually take the combined contraceptive pill safely, unless they have other stroke risk factors like
high blood pressure
or a family history of
cardiovascular disease
.
Talk to your GP about alternative forms of contraception if you experience aura symptoms and are taking the combined contraceptive pill.
Mental health problems
Migraine is associated with a very small increased risk of mental health problems, including:
depression
bipolar disorder
anxiety disorder
panic disorder"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/malnutrition/,"Malnutrition
Malnutrition means poor nutrition. Most commonly this is caused by not eating enough (undernutrition) or not eating enough of the right food to give your body the nutrients it needs.
A balanced diet should provide enough nutrients like calories, protein and vitamins, to keep you healthy. Without this, you may not be getting all the nutrients you need and this can lead to malnutrition.
Malnutrition can result in:
unplanned weight loss
muscle loss
a low body mass index (BMI)
vitamin and mineral deficiencies
This can leave you feeling tired, weak and affect your ability to recover from an illness.
Symptoms of malnutrition
Malnutrition can be difficult to recognise. It can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages.
Common signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
loss of appetite and lack of interest in food or fluids
unplanned weight loss – this might cause clothing, rings, watches or dentures to become loose
tiredness or low energy levels
reduced ability to perform everyday tasks like showering, getting dressed or cooking
reduced muscle strength – for example, not being able to walk as far or as fast as usual
changes in mood which might cause feelings of lethargy and depression
poor concentration
poor growth in children
increased risk of infection, recurrent infections, taking longer to recover and poor wound healing
difficulty keeping warm
dizziness
Speak to your GP if:
you have any of the symptoms of malnutrition
you notice a drop in weight or you’ve lost weight without trying
Conditions that cause malnutrition
Sometimes, medical conditions cause your body to need more nutrients. Some medical conditions can lead to your body being unable to absorb or use nutrients. These may include:
cancer
and
liver disease
that can cause a lack of appetite, persistent pain or nausea
COPD
, pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, which cause your body to need more nutrients but can reduce your appetite
mental health conditions, like
depression
or
schizophrenia
, which may affect your ability to look after yourself
Crohn’s disease
,
ulcerative colitis
or
cystic fibrosis
that disrupt your body’s ability to digest food or absorb nutrients
burns, fractures and post major surgery, due to increased demand for nutrients
dementia
– people with dementia may be unable to communicate their needs, may use up a lot of calories pacing or may experience a loss of appetite
dysphagia
– a condition that makes swallowing difficult or painful
persistent vomiting or
diarrhoea
Some types and combinations of medication can increase your risk of developing malnutrition. Always check your medicines information and speak to a healthcare professional for advice if you have a concern. Do not stop taking your medication without advice from a healthcare professional.
Other causes of malnutrition
Physical, social and ageing issues can also cause malnutrition.
Physical issues
Physical issues can contribute to malnutrition. For example:
if your teeth are in a poor condition, if your dentures do not fit, or if you have a sore mouth, eating can be difficult or painful
you may lose your appetite as a result of losing your sense of smell and taste
you may have a physical disability or other physical impairment that makes it difficult for you to cook or shop for food yourself
Social factors
Social issues that can contribute to malnutrition include:
living alone and being socially isolated
having limited knowledge about nutrition or cooking
reduced mobility
alcohol or drug use
low income or poverty
reliance on food banks
Ageing
As we get older we might become more likely to experience malnutrition. This might be because of how we feel, and physical and social factors. The risk also increases because we’re more likely to have one or more medical conditions as we get older.
Diagnosing malnutrition
A healthcare professional can assess you for malnutrition using a screening tool like
‘Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool’ (‘MUST’)
.
Screen yourself for malnutrition
Treating malnutrition
If you’ve lost weight or your appetite is poor, you can make simple changes to your meals, snacks and drinks to help treat malnutrition.
Choosing nutrient-dense food and drinks can help improve your calorie intake. This might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with other conditions like dysphagia. Ask your GP, dietitian or nurse for further advice if you’re unsure.
You should speak to a healthcare professional if you’ve had to limit the fat and sugar you eat in the past due to a health condition like high cholesterol or diabetes.
Ways to increase your calories
Try the following ideas to help you to increase the amount of calories and protein in your diet.
Do
eat ‘little and often’ – 3 small meals a day with 2-3 snacks in-between meals
include protein like meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans or lentils in each meal
add high calorie ingredients like full cream milk, cheese, butter, ghee, olive oil and cream to meals and drinks
include puddings after your lunch and dinner like creamy yoghurts, custards, rice pudding, milk puddings or ice-cream
try ready meals if you don’t feel like cooking
choose nourishing milky drinks like malted drinks, hot chocolate, milky coffee and milkshakes
choose high sugar drinks like fruit juice, smoothies, fizzy drinks or squash (you can also add egg powder to juice to increase its nutrients)
try including 1 pint of full cream milk each day – you can fortify (add extra nutrients to) this by adding 4 tablespoons of dried milk powder – and use this in drinks, cooking, cereals and puddings
Don’t
do not have drinks just before meals because this can make you feel fuller quicker
do not choose low fat, sugar-free, diet foods and drinks – for example skimmed milk
If you’re using vegan alternatives to cheese, butter, cream or milk, try to choose the highest calorie option.
How to add extra nutrients to milk

Oral nutritional supplements
Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are a range of liquid and powder products that help support better nutrition.
They contain calories, protein, vitamins and minerals to help increase your intake. They’re designed to be taken alongside your diet and the ‘food first’ advice above to promote progress with your weight.
Tube feeding (enteral feeding)
Depending on how severe your symptoms are, your healthcare professional might recommend a “feeding tube”.
There are different types of tubes. Which one is best for you depends on your diagnosis and symptoms.
The most common types of feeding tube include:
nasogastric – through your nose and into your stomach
nasojejunal – though your nose and further into your digestive tract
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) – a tube is placed directly into the stomach via your abdomen
Depending on your condition alternative routes of nutrition may be considered."

Complications of middle ear infections
About middle ear infections
Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.
Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between six and 15 months old are most commonly affected.
It’s estimated that around one in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they’re 10 years old.
Symptoms of a middle ear infection
In most cases, the symptoms of a middle ear infection (otitis media) develop quickly and resolve in a few days. This is known as acute otitis media. The main symptoms include:
earache
a high temperature (fever)
being sick
a lack of energy
slight
hearing loss
– if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid
In some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.
Signs in young children
As babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what’s wrong with them. Signs that a young child might have an ear infection include:
raised temperature
pulling, tugging or rubbing their ear
irritability, poor feeding or restlessness at night
coughing
or a runny nose
unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness
loss of balance
When to seek medical advice
Most cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there’s usually no need to see your GP.
However, see your GP if you or your child have:
symptoms showing no sign of improvement after two or three days
a lot of pain
a discharge of pus or fluid from the ear – some people develop a persistent and painless ear discharge that lasts for many months, known as chronic suppurative otitis media
an underlying health condition, such as
cystic fibrosis
or
congenital heart disease
, which could make complications more likely
Read more about
diagnosing middle ear infections
How middle ear infections are treated
Most ear infections clear up within three to five days and don’t need any specific treatment. If necessary,
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature.
Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Read more about giving your child painkillers.
Antibiotics
aren’t routinely used to treat middle ear infections, although they may occasionally be prescribed if symptoms persist or are particularly severe.
Read more about
treating middle ear infections
What causes middle ear infections?
Most middle ear infections occur when an infection such as a
cold
, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear and causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked.
This mean mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.
An enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it causes persistent or frequent ear infections. Read more about removing adenoids.
Younger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as:
the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults
a child’s adenoids are relatively much larger than an adults
Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:
having a cleft palate – a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth
having
Down’s syndrome
– a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features
Can middle ear infections be prevented?
It’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing the condition. These include:
make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations – particularly the
pneumococcal vaccine
and the
DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccine
avoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking)
don’t give your child a dummy once they’re older than six to 12 months old
don’t feed your child while they’re lying flat on their back
if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk
Avoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child’s chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection.
Further problems
Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur.
Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including:
the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis)
the inner ear (
labyrinthitis
)
the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
)
Rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.
If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital.
Read more about the
complications of middle ear infections
Diagnosing middle ear infections
A middle ear infection (otitis media) can usually be diagnosed using an instrument called an otoscope.
An otoscope is a small handheld device with a magnifying glass and a light source at the end. Using an otoscope, a doctor can examine the ear to look for signs of fluid in the middle ear, which may indicate an infection.
Signs of fluid in the middle ear can include the ear drum:
bulging
being an unusual colour (usually red or yellow)
having a cloudy appearance
In some cases, a hole may have developed in the eardrum (perforated ear drum) and there may be fluid in the ear canal (the tube between the outer ear and eardrum).
Some otoscopes can also be used to blow a small puff of air into the ear to check for any blockages in the middle ear, which could be a sign of an infection. If the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the throat and middle ear) is clear, the eardrum will move slightly. If it’s blocked, the eardrum will remain still.
Further tests
Further tests are normally only required if treatment isn’t working or complications develop. These tests will usually be carried out at your local ear, nose and throat (ENT) department.
Some of the tests that may be carried out are described below.
Tympanometry
Tympanometry is a test that measures how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure.
During a tympanometry test, a probe is placed into your child’s ear. The probe changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. A measuring device is attached to the probe to record how the drum moves and how changes in air pressure affect this movement.
A healthy ear drum should move easily if there’s a change in air pressure. If your child’s ear drum moves slowly or not at all, it usually suggests there’s fluid behind it.
Audiometry
Audiometry is a hearing test that uses a machine called an audiometer to produce sounds of different volume and frequency. This can help determine if your child has any hearing loss as a result of their condition.
During the test, your child listens through headphones and is asked if they can hear the sounds.
Scans
On the very rare occasions where there’s a possibility the infection has spread out of the middle ear and into the surrounding area, a scan of the ear may be carried out. This may be either a:
computerised tomography (CT) scan
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
A CT scan takes a series of
X-rays
and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed image, whereas an MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the inside of the body.
Treating middle ear infections
Most middle ear infections (otitis media) clear up within three to five days and don’t need any specific treatment.
You can relieve any pain and a high temperature using over the counter painkillers such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
.
Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age.
Placing a warm flannel or washcloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain until the condition passes.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics
aren’t routinely used to treat middle ear infections as there’s no evidence that they speed up the healing process. Many cases are caused by viruses, which antibiotics aren’t effective against.
Using antibiotics to treat minor bacterial infections also increases the likelihood of bacteria becoming resistant to them over time. This means more serious infections could become untreatable in the future.
Read about antibiotic resistance for more information.
In some cases, your GP may give you a prescription that you can choose to pick up a few days later if the condition hasn’t improved by then.
Adults and children who develop a long-term middle ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media) may benefit from short courses of antibiotic ear drops.
Children
Antibiotics are usually only considered if your child:
has a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to complications, such as
cystic fibrosis
or
congenital heart disease
is less than three months old
is less than two years old with an infection in both ears
has discharge coming from their ear
Adults
Adults may be prescribed antibiotics if:
they have a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to complications, such as cystic fibrosis or
congenital heart disease
symptoms are showing no signs of improvement after four days
Grommets
For children with recurrent severe middle ear infections, tiny tubes may be inserted into the eardrum to help drain fluid. These tubes are called grommets.
Grommets are inserted under
general anaesthetic
, which means your child will be asleep and won’t feel any pain. The procedure usually only takes about 15 minutes and your child should be able to go home the same day.
A grommet helps keep the eardrum open for several months. As the eardrum starts to heal, the grommet will slowly be pushed out of the eardrum and eventually falls out. This process happens naturally and shouldn’t be painful. Most grommets fall out within six to 12 months of being inserted.
Some children need another procedure to replace the grommets if they’re still experiencing problems.
Treatment with grommets isn’t routinely funded in all areas or for adults with recurrent otitis media.
Complications of middle ear infections
Serious complications of middle ear infections (otitis media) are very rare but very young children are still at risk because their immune systems are still developing.
Some of the main complications associated with middle ear infections are detailed below.
Mastoiditis
Mastoiditis can develop if an infection spreads out of the middle ear and into the area of bone underneath the ear (the mastoids).
Symptoms of mastoiditis can include:
a high temperature (fever)
swelling behind the ear, which pushes it forward
redness and tenderness or pain behind the ear
a creamy discharge from the ear
headache
hearing loss
Mastoiditis is usually treated in hospital with
antibiotics
given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). In some cases, surgery may be required to drain the ear and remove the infected mastoid bone.
Cholesteatoma
A cholesteatoma is an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear that can sometimes develop as a result of recurring or persistent middle ear infections.
If it’s not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage the delicate structures deep inside your ear, such as the tiny bones that are essential for hearing.
Symptoms of a cholesteatoma can include:
hearing loss
weakness in half your face
dizziness
tinnitus
– hearing sounds from inside their body rather than from an outside source
In most cases, surgery is required to remove a cholesteatoma.
Labyrinthitis
In some cases, an infection in the middle ear can spread into the inner ear and affect the delicate structure deep inside the ear called the labyrinth. This is known as
labyrinthitis
.
Symptoms of labyrinthitis can include:
dizziness
vertigo
(the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning)
loss of balance
hearing loss
The symptoms of labyrinthitis usually pass within a few weeks, although medication to relieve the symptoms and treat the underlying infection may sometimes be prescribed. Read more about
treating labyrinthitis
.
Problems with speech and language development
If your child has frequent ear infections that affect their hearing while they’re very young, there’s a risk their speech and language development may be affected.
Contact your GP for advice if you’re concerned about your child’s development at any point.
Facial paralysis
In very rare cases, the swelling associated with otitis media can cause the facial nerve to become compressed. The facial nerve is a section of nerve that runs through the skull and is used by the brain to control facial expressions.
Compression of the nerve can lead to a person being unable to move some or all of their face. This is known as facial paralysis.
This can be frightening when it first occurs, as many parents are concerned their child may have experienced a
stroke
. However, the condition usually resolves once the underlying infection has passed and rarely causes any long-term problems.
Meningitis
A very rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection is
meningitis
. This can occur if the infection spreads to the protective outer layer of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges).
Symptoms of meningitis can include:
severe headache
being sick
a high temperature (fever)
stiff neck
sensitivity to light
rapid breathing
a blotchy red rash that does not fade or change colour when you place a glass against it (although this is not always present)
If you think your child may have meningitis, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Meningitis caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated in hospital with antibiotics given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). Read more about
treating meningitis
.
Brain abscess
Another very rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection is a brain abscess. This is a pus-filled swelling that develops inside the brain.
Symptoms of a brain abscess can include:
a severe headache
changes in mental state, such as confusion
weakness or paralysis on one side of the body
a high temperature (fever)
seizures (fits)
If you suspect that you or someone you know may have a brain abscess, call 999 for an ambulance.
A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of antibiotics and surgery. The surgeon will usually open the skull and drain the pus from the abscess or remove the abscess entirely."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/mouth-ulcer/,"Mouth ulcer
Mouth ulcers are painful sores that appear in the mouth. They’re uncomfortable but they’re usually harmless. Most clear up by themselves within 1 to 2 weeks.
Mouth ulcers are common and can usually be managed at home, without seeing your dentist or GP.
What does a mouth ulcer look like?
Mouth ulcers are usually round or oval sores that commonly appear inside the mouth on the:
cheeks
lips
tongue
They can be white, red, yellow or grey in colour and swollen.
You may have more than one mouth ulcer at a time and they may spread or grow.
Mouth ulcers shouldn’t be confused with
cold sores
, which are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. Cold sores often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth.
When to get help
Speak to a pharmacist if:
you have a mouth ulcer
They can give you advice and treatment.
If you have a dental problem you should always
phone your dentist
first. If you’re not registered with any dental practice then you should
read our advice on dental emergencies
.
Your pharmacist may advise that you see your GP or dentist if:
your mouth ulcer has lasted 3 weeks
you keep getting mouth ulcers
the mouth ulcer grows bigger than usual or is near the back of your throat
your mouth ulcer becomes more painful or red – this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, which may need treatment with
antibiotics
Mouth ulcers are also a possible symptom of
hand, foot and mouth disease
. Speak to your GP or phone
111
if you’re unsure.
How to treat mouth ulcers
Most mouth ulcers clear up by themselves within 1 to 2 weeks without treatment.
However, treatment can help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking.
Self care
There are things you can do to speed up healing.
Do
use a soft toothbrush to brush your teeth
drink cool drinks through a straw
eat softer foods
get regular dental check-ups
eat a healthy, balanced diet
try to reduce stress and anxiety
Don’t
do not eat very spicy, salty or acidic food
do not eat rough, crunchy food, such as toast or crisps
do not drink very hot or acidic drinks, such as fruit juice
do not use chewing gum
do not use toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate
Pharmacy medicines
You can get several types of mouth ulcer treatment from a pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist about the best treatment for you.
Treatment from a dentist or GP
A GP or dentist may prescribe stronger medicine to treat severe, persistent or infected mouth ulcers.
Possible treatments include:
steroid mouth spray or steroid tablets that dissolve in your mouth
painkilling gels, ointments, sprays or tablets
mouthwashes to kill or remove any germs in your mouth
What causes mouth ulcers?
In many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the mouth. For example:
accidentally biting the inside of your cheek or a sharp tooth
poorly fitting dentures
hard food
a faulty filling
It’s not always clear what causes mouth ulcers that keep returning, but triggers are thought to include:
stress and anxiety
hormonal changes – some women develop mouth ulcers during their monthly period
eating certain foods – such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour
toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate
stopping smoking – when you first stop smoking, you may develop mouth ulcers
Your genes are also thought to have a role. Around 40% of people who keep getting mouth ulcers report that it runs in their family.
Medical conditions
Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medical conditions, such as:
viral infections – including the
cold sore virus
,
chickenpox
, and
hand, foot and mouth disease
vitamin B12
or
iron deficiency
crohn’s disease
– a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system
coeliac disease
– a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten
reactive arthritis
– a condition that causes inflammation in various places in the body, usually as a reaction to an infection
weakened immune system – for example, due to
HIV
or
lupus
behçet’s disease – a rare and poorly understood condition that also causes swelling of the blood vessels
Medications and treatments
Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medications or treatments, such as:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – such as
ibuprofen
nicorandil – a medication sometimes used to treat angina
beta-blockers
– used to treat conditions such as angina, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms
a side effect of
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
– this is known as mucositis
Is it mouth cancer?

mouth cancer
. If mouth cancer is detected early, the chances of a complete recovery are good.
Regular dental check-ups
are the best way to detect the early signs."

About mouth cancer
Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums.
Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common.
Symptoms of mouth cancer include:
red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue
ulcers
a lump
Speak to your GP if these symptoms do not heal within 3 weeks, especially if you’re a heavy drinker or smoker.
Types of mouth cancer
A cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer starts in.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin.
Less common types of mouth cancer include:
oral malignant melanoma – where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour
adenocarcinomas – cancers that develop inside the salivary glands
What causes mouth cancer?
Mouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably.
Risk factors for developing mouth cancer include:
smoking or using products that contain tobacco
drinking alcohol – smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large
infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes
genital warts
Read more about the
causes of mouth cancer
Who is affected by mouth cancer?
Mouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer.
Most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50 and 74 years old.
Mouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it’s thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people.
Mouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women.
Treating mouth cancer
There are 3 main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are:
surgery – where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue
chemotherapy
– where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells
radiotherapy
– where high energy
X-rays
are used to kill cancerous cells
These treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.
Read more about
treating mouth cancer
Complications of mouth cancer
Both surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (
dysphagia
).
Dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration
pneumonia
.
Read more about the
complications of mouth cancer
Reducing the risk
The three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing – or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment – are:
not smoking
keeping to the
recommended limits for alcohol consumption
eating a ‘Mediterranean-style diet’, with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about
healthy eating
)
It’s also important that you have regular
dental check-ups
because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.
Symptoms of mouth cancer
Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.
The most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:
red or white patches in the mouth or throat
a lump
ulcers
Other symptoms may include:
persistent pain in the mouth
pain or difficulty when swallowing (
dysphagia
)
changes in your voice, or speech problems
swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck
unexplained weight loss
bleeding or numbness in the mouth
a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason
difficulty moving your jaw
When to seek medical advice
Many of these symptoms can be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.
But it’s strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of these symptoms have lasted for more than 3 weeks. It’s especially important to seek medical advice if you’re a heavy drinker or smoker.
Dental check-ups
Mouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.
This is why it’s important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.
You should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of
tooth decay
or
gum disease
.
Causes of mouth cancer
The 2 leading causes of mouth cancer in the UK are drinking too much alcohol and smoking.
Both alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to
cancer
.
The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.
Exactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain.
How mouth cancer spreads
There are 2 ways mouth cancer can spread:
directly – the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw
via the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands found throughout your body which produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection
Mouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer.
Other risk factors
Other risk factors for mouth cancer may include:
chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus
chewing betel nuts with or without tobacco
a poor diet
the human papilloma virus (HPV)
poor oral hygiene
Smokeless tobacco
There is a range of smokeless tobacco products including:
chewing tobacco
snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted
snus – a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip
Smokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer.
Betel nuts
Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.
They have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.
Due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.
Diet
There is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer.
A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer.
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.
You can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected – you do not have to have ‘full sex’; just close skin-to-skin contact.
There is evidence that in rare cases, certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer.
Poor oral hygiene
There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having
tooth decay
,
gum disease
, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.
Diagnosing mouth cancer
If you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your GP will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.
If mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
Biopsy
It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a
biopsy
.
There are 3 main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer.
Punch biopsy
A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth.
The area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers.
The procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.
Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer.
Your neck is numbed and a needle is used to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then checked for cancerous cells.
FNA is not painful but it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.
Panendoscopy
A panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities.
This is a long thin tube with a camera and a light which is guided through the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy.
The panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe).
Further tests
If the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached.
If the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system – a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system.
Once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs.
However, it’s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs.
Therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours.
These tests may include:
an
X-ray
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
Further biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out.
Staging and grading
Once these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is:
staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread
the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future
This will help determine whether you have:
early mouth cancer (usually curable)
intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable)
or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan)
There are 3 grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive).
Grading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated. Read more about
treating mouth cancer
.
Treating mouth cancer
Your treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it’s spread – as well as your general health.
Your treatment plan
If the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.
Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Before treatment begins
Radiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you’ll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out.
If you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful.
Your specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking.
Read more about
quitting smoking
and
cutting down on alcohol
Surgery
For mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
If the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour.
Other forms of surgery
If your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest.
If your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue.
If the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place.
Occasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer.
These can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected.
During surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can’t be detected.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring.
The treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.
While it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including:
sore, red skin (like sunburn)
mouth ulcers
sore mouth and throat
dry mouth
loss of, or changes in taste
loss of appetite
tiredness
feeling sick
stiff jaw
bad breath
Any side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible.
The side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.
Internal radiotherapy
Internal radiotherapy – also called brachytherapy – is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic.
They will be left for between 1 and 8 days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth.
Visits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won’t be able to visit you.
The radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain 5 to 10 days after the implants are removed.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.
Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce.
Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include:
fatigue (tiredness)
sore mouth
mouth ulcers
feeling sick
being sick
hair loss
tiredness
The side effects should stop once the treatment has finished.
Chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.
Cetuximab
Cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
Cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who:
are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated)
are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)
Complications of mouth cancer
Complications of treatment for mouth cancer can include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech problems and emotional disruption.
Difficulty swallowing
Dysphagia
is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. It’s easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid for granted, but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted.
Surgery and
radiotherapy
can affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. This can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.
If you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (SLT) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. One way an SLT can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. The dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using X-rays your SLT can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs.
If this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. The SLT will teach you exercises so you can ‘relearn’ how to swallow properly.
Your ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. However, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover.
In some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. A dietitian can give you dietary advice.
Read more detailed information about
how dysphagia is treated
Speech
Much like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth).
Radiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. In severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood.
An SLT will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds.
Emotional impact
The emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect.
For example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel up when the cancer responds to treatment. Then you may feel down again as you try to come to terms with the side effects and after effects of your treatment.
This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Signs that you may be depressed include:
feeling down or hopeless during the past month
no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy
Contact your GP for advice if you think you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments for depression, including
antidepressant medication
and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

coping with cancer
Living with mouth cancer
Having mouth cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment.
If you have cancer you’re covered by the
Disability Discrimination Act
. This means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. Examples of these include:
allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments
allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment
The definition of what is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. For example, how much it would affect your employer’s business.
It will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. Talk to your human resources department if you have one. Your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice.
If you’re having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your local
Citizens Advice Bureau
.
Relationships with others
It is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. Do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.
Money and financial support
If you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support:
if you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer
if you don’t have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
if you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income
Find out as early as possible what help is available to you. Speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need.
Talk to others
If you have questions, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as:
Cancer Research UK: Cancer chat
Macmillan Cancer Support: Head and neck cancer forum
Caring for others with mouth cancer
Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.
If you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.
Look after your health
Eat regularly and healthily. If you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least 1 of your day’s meals. Instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit.
Look after your emotional health
As well as exhaustion, isolation and worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. These feelings are natural.
Look for support
Friends and family may not always understand what you are going through and it can be helpful to talk to people in the same situation.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/kaposis-sarcoma/,"Kaposi’s sarcoma
Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare type of cancer caused by a virus. It can affect the skin and internal organs.
It’s mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe
HIV
infection. It can also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus.
Signs and symptoms
The most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They’re usually red or purple and look similar to bruises.
Over time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other.
Internal organs can also be affected, including the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which can cause symptoms such as:
uncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs
(lymphoedema)
breathlessness
, coughing up blood and
chest pain
nausea, vomiting,
stomach pain
and
diarrhoea
The rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of Kaposi’s sarcoma you have. Most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years.
When to seek medical advice
You should speak to your GP if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma. If you have HIV, you can also contact your local HIV clinic if you have any concerns.
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. If they suspect Kaposi’s sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.
These tests may include:
an HIV test – a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven’t already been diagnosed with the condition)
a skin
biopsy
– where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and checked for Kaposi’s sarcoma cells
an endoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
to see if your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected
What causes Kaposi’s sarcoma?
Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth.
HHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi’s sarcoma. It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus.
A weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi’s sarcoma.
The virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours.
Types of Kaposi’s sarcoma and their treatment
There are 4 main types of Kaposi’s sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways.
HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma
Although it’s not as common as it used to be, Kaposi’s sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV.
HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication – known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) – to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body.
Read more about
treating HIV
.
Some people may also require treatment with
radiotherapy
(where high-energy rays are used to destroy cancer cells) or
chemotherapy
(where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it’s causing.
Classic Kaposi’s sarcoma
Classic Kaposi’s sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in the UK are Ashkenazi Jews.
It’s thought people who develop classic Kaposi’s sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus.
Unlike the other types of Kaposi’s sarcoma, the symptoms of classic Kaposi’s sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually limited to the skin.
Immediate treatment isn’t usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn’t affect life expectancy. You’ll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse.
Radiotherapy is often used if treatment is required, although small skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing).
Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma
Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant. It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again.
Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It’s normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used.
Endemic African Kaposi’s sarcoma
Endemic African Kaposi’s sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region.
Although this type of Kaposi’s sarcoma is classified separately from HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed HIV infection. All suspected cases therefore must have an HIV test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is HIV medication.
In cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi’s sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used.
Outlook
With proper treatment, Kaposi’s sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK.
The discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely.
A complete cure for any type of Kaposi’s sarcoma isn’t always possible, and there’s a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible."

About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer.
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body’s blood cells. Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow.
Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells.
Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.
Signs and symptoms
In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It’s often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.
However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including:
a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones
weak bones that break (fracture) easily
tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by
anaemia
)
repeated infections
less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequent
nosebleeds
, bleeding gums and heavy periods
Read more about the
symptoms of multiple myeloma
When to speak to your GP
Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms. While they’re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it’s best to get a proper diagnosis.
Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma.
They may also arrange blood and urine tests that can detect abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells.
If myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment.
Read more about
diagnosing multiple myeloma
Who is affected?
Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer.
It’s not known exactly what causes the condition, although it’s more common in:
people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) – an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood
men
adults over 60 – most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare
black people – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations
Read more about the
causes of multiple myeloma
.
How multiple myeloma is treated
There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years.
Treatment will often involve:
a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells
medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia
anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses)
As part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma.

Support groups
If you’ve been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to contact a local or national support group, such as
Myeloma UK
.
Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences.
The Myeloma UK website has more information about how they can help you and
finding a local support group
.
Symptoms of multiple myeloma
In the early stages, multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms or complications, and may only be diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.
However, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems.
Bone pain
Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement.
Bone fractures and spinal cord compression
Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected.
Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).
Compression of the spinal cord can cause pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.
Anaemia
Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (
anaemia
). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.
If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.
Repeated infections
People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness).
You may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.
Raised calcium levels in the blood
A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.
Symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme
thirst
, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently,
constipation
, confusion and drowsiness.
Unusual bleeding
Bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage) – such as frequent
nosebleeds
, bleeding gums and heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.
Thickened blood
In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision,
headaches
,
dizziness
, bleeding from the gums or nose, and
shortness of breath
.
Kidney problems
Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by the cancer cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also cause kidney damage.
Eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include:
weight loss and poor appetite
swollen ankles, feet or hands
tiredness and a lack of energy
shortness of breath
itchy skin
feeling sick
When to seek medical advice
You should speak to your GP if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they’re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible.

Causes of multiple myeloma
In multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous.
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body’s blood cells.
Plasma cells are normally produced in a controlled way. In cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. These fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells.
The exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it.
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS)
In almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had MGUS.
MGUS is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. This does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required.
However, every year around 1 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma. There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so ongoing outpatient tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have MGUS.
Other factors
As well as MGUS, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including:
age – your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare
gender – men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women
ethnicity – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations
It has also been suggested that having a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or
HIV
), being overweight or
obese
, and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. However, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.
Diagnosing multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it’s an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms.
Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. During the examination, your GP will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness.
You may need urine and
blood tests
to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins).
If multiple myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and scans.
Blood tests
A number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition.
These may include:
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV) – if you have multiple myeloma, your ESR or PV will usually be raised
tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells
a full blood count (FBC) to check levels of different types of blood cells – your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets
liver and kidney function
blood calcium level
Urine tests
A urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. The abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains, or Bence Jones protein.
These proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. You may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. This will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working.
X-rays and other scans
You will have
X-rays
taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage.
Other scans, such as
computerised tomography (CT) scans
and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
, may also be carried out.
Bone marrow biopsy
A bone marrow
biopsy
is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. A needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. A sample of bone may also be removed.
This is carried out using a
local anaesthetic
(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed).
The sample of bone marrow and bone will be used to check for cancerous plasma cells.
Treating multiple myeloma
If you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma.
The team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. However, the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment.
There are 2 main aims in treating multiple myeloma:
to bring the myeloma under control
to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as
anaemia
and bone pain
While treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can’t be cured. This means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse).
Not everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. This is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, or
smouldering myeloma
.
If you don’t need treatment, you’ll be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. If you do need treatment, the following options are most commonly used.
Bringing myeloma under control
The initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either:
non-intensive – for older or less fit patients (this is more common)
intensive – for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients)
The decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness.
As a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. For those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended.
Those aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into.
Both non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. Intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant.
The medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
medicines kill the myeloma cells. The most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide.
These treatments are mostly taken in tablet form. They are reasonably well tolerated and side effects are mild. Possible side effects include:
increased risk of infections
feeling sick
vomiting
hair loss
Your clinician will give you advice and information about your risk of developing potentially serious infections, and tell you what you can do to reduce your risk of picking up infections during your treatment.
Steroids
Steroid medications (
corticosteroids
) help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective. The 2 most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and prednisolone.
Steroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. Possible side effects include
heartburn
,
indigestion
, increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep.
Thalidomide
Thalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. You take it as a tablet every day, usually in the evening as it can make you feel sleepy.
Other common side effects include:
constipation
dizziness
rashes
numbness or tingling in the hands and feet (
peripheral neuropathy
)
Thalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form of
contraception
such as a
condom
must be used during treatment.
There is also a risk you may develop a blood clot when taking thalidomide, so you may be given medication to help prevent this. Contact your care team immediately if you develop symptoms of a blood clot, such as pain or swelling in one of your legs, or
chest pain
and
breathlessness
.
Bortezomib
Bortezomib (Velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them.
There are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you.
The medication is given by injection, usually under the skin. Possible side effects include:
tiredness
nausea
diarrhoea
numbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)
Stem cell transplant
After initial therapy with primarily outpatient-based treatments, people receiving intensive treatment will be given a much higher dose of chemotherapy medication as an inpatient to potentially help destroy a larger number of myeloma cells. This aims to achieve a longer period of remission (where there is no sign of active disease in your body).
However, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a stem cell transplant will be needed to help your bone marrow recover.
In most cases, the stem cells will be collected from you before treatment (autologous transplantation). In rare cases, they are collected from a sibling or an unrelated donor.
Treating relapses
Further treatment is needed if myeloma returns. Treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment.
Additional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used again as your haematologist feels is appropriate.
You may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into new treatments for multiple myeloma.
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. They’re both taken by mouth, and both can have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause:
increased risk of infection – as a result of a low number of white blood cells
anaemia – caused by a low number of red blood cells
bruising and bleeding – because of a low platelet count
They may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide.
Let your care team know if you experience any problems or unusual symptoms while taking lenalidomide or pomalidomide.
Treating symptoms and complications of myeloma
As well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition.
For example:
painkillers – may be given to reduce pain
radiotherapy
– may be used to relieve bone pain or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired
bisphosphonate medication – either given as tablets or by injection, this may help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood
blood transfusions
or erythropoietin medication – may be used to increase your red blood cell count and treat anaemia
surgery – may be carried out to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back)
dialysis
– may be required if you develop kidney failure
plasma exchange – treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity)
These treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand.
Clinical trials and research
Research is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. To help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial during your treatment.
Clinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective.
It’s important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment.
There will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,"Multiple sclerosis (MS)
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It’s a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability. In many cases, it’s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
MS Society
estimates that there are more than 130,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK.
It’s often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It’s about two to three times more common in women than men.
Symptoms of MS
Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently.
The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people’s symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go.
Periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions.
Some of the most common symptoms include:
Muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness
MS can cause your muscles to:
feel weak
become stiff and resistant to movement (spasticity)
contract tightly and painfully (spasm)
Vision problems
In around 1 in 4 cases of MS, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of your eyes (optic neuritis). You may experience:
some temporary loss of vision in the affected eye, usually lasting for days to weeks
colour blindness
eye pain, which is usually worse when moving the eye
flashes of light when moving the eye
You might also experience double vision or involuntary eye movements, which can make it seem as though objects are jumping around.
Abnormal sensations
You might have persistent numbness or tingling in different parts of your body which can last a few days to weeks.
Mobility problems
MS can make walking and moving around difficult, particularly if you also have muscle weakness and spasticity. You may experience:
clumsiness
difficulty with balance and co-ordination (ataxia)
shaking of the limbs (tremor)
dizziness and
vertigo
, which can make it feel as though
everything around you is spinning
Pain
Some people with MS experience pain which can take two forms.
Pain caused by MS itself (neuropathic pain)
This is pain caused by damage to the nervous system, and can include:
stabbing pains in the face
stabbing sensations in the torso (body) and limbs
feeling like you’re burning
pins and needles
feeling like you’re being hugged or squeezed
Muscle spasms can sometimes be painful.
Musculoskeletal pain
This can be back, neck and joint pain particularly if you have problems walking or moving around.
Bladder problems
Bladder problems are common in MS. They may include:
having to pee more often
having a sudden, urgent need to pee, which can lead to
unintentionally passing urine (
urge incontinence
)
difficulty emptying the bladder completely
having to get up during the night to pee
recurrent
urinary tract infections
These problems can also have a range of causes other than MS.
Bowel problems
Many people with MS also have problems with their bowel function.
Constipation
is the most common problem. You may find passing stools (poo) difficult and pass them much less than normal.
Bowel incontinence
is less common, but is often linked to constipation. If a poo becomes stuck, it can irritate the wall of the bowel, causing it to produce more fluid and mucus that can leak out of your bottom.
Some of these problems aren’t specific to MS and can be the result of medications.
Sexual problems
MS can have an effect on sexual function.
For women, problems include difficulty reaching orgasm. They might experience decreased vaginal lubrication and sensation.
Men with MS might find it hard to get or maintain an erection (
erectile dysfunction
). They may also find it takes a lot longer to ejaculate when having sex or masturbating. They might lose the ability to ejaculate altogether.
Both men and women with MS may find they’re less interested in sex than they were before. This could be directly related to MS, a mood disorder like depression, or it could be the result of living with the condition.
Speech and swallowing difficulties
Some people with MS have difficulty chewing or swallowing (
dysphagia
) at some point. They might also slur their speech or be difficult to understand (dysarthria).
Fatigue
Feeling fatigued is a common and troublesome symptom of MS.
It can cause an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that means it’s a struggle to carry out simple tasks.
Fatigue tends to get worse:
towards the end of each day
in hot weather
after exercising
during illness
Mental health issues
Many people with MS experience periods of depression. It’s unclear if this is directly caused by MS, or is due to the stress of having to live with a long-term condition, or both.
Anxiety
can also be a problem for people with MS, possibly due to the unpredictable nature of the condition.
In rare cases, people with MS can experience rapid and severe mood swings.
Problems with thinking, learning and planning
Some people with MS have problems with thinking, learning and planning. This is known as cognitive dysfunction and can include:
problems learning and remembering new things although long-term memory is usually unaffected
slowness in processing lots of information or multi-tasking
a shortened attention span
getting stuck on words
problems with understanding and processing visual information, such as reading a map
difficulty with planning and problem solving – people often report that they know what they want to do, but can’t grasp how to do it
problems with reasoning, such as mathematical laws or solving puzzles
Many of these problems aren’t specific to MS. They can be caused by other conditions, including depression and anxiety or medication.
Speak to your GP if:
you think you have symptoms of MS
The symptoms can be similar to several other conditions, so they’re not necessarily caused by MS.
What happens when someone has MS
MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it.
In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body.
The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
.
These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.
When the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.
What causes MS?
Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn’t known. It’s not caused by anything you’ve done and it’s not clear if you can prevent it.
It’s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition.
Some of the factors that might cause MS include:
Your genes
MS isn’t directly inherited, but if you’re related to someone with the condition you’re more likely to develop it. The chance of a sibling or child of someone with MS also developing it is around 2-3%.
Lack of sunlight and vitamin D
MS is more common in countries far from the equator. This could mean that a lack of sunlight and low vitamin D levels may play a role in the condition. It’s not clear whether vitamin D supplements can help prevent MS.
Smoking
People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop MS compared to those who don’t smoke.
Viral infections
Infections, particularly those caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, (responsible for
glandular fever
), might trigger the immune system, leading to MS in some people.
More research will help us understand why MS occurs and whether it can be prevented or not.
Diagnosing multiple sclerosis
It can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. You may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.
If your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.
Some of the tests you may need to confirm MS are:
neurological examination
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
lumbar puncture
blood test
Types of MS
Once you have a diagnosis of MS, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of MS you have – either relapsing remitting MS or primary progressive MS.
This will largely be based on:
the pattern of your symptoms – like whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress)
the results of an MRI scan
It can take some time to find out which type of MS you have because the symptoms are so varied. It can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive MS, as the condition usually worsens slowly.
Treating multiple sclerosis
Phone your specialist MS nurse or GP if:
you think you’re having a relapse
Treatment with disease-modifying therapies
Although there isn’t a cure for MS, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs.
These reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses.
These treatments reduce the chances of developing progressive symptoms of MS. They might also help to slow worsening disability in MS.
Disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They’re only prescribed to those with either:
relapsing remitting MS
secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they’ve had
primary progressive MS who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an MRI scan
People without relapses are less likely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them.
Treatment of a relapse of MS
Sometimes an infection can cause a flare up of symptoms rather than a relapse, so your nurse or GP will check for other possible causes.
Treatment for a relapse might involve a five-day course of steroid tablets taken at home.
Steroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse. They don’t prevent further relapses or stop MS getting worse over time.
Steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible
steroid side effects
. The side effects could include infection, mood disturbance, stomach ulceration,
osteoporosis (weak bones)
, weight gain and
diabetes
.
Not using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will help to reduce the risk of side effects.
Treatment for MS symptoms
There are different treatments available for MS symptoms.
Fatigue
Your healthcare professional should give you advice about ways to manage fatigue. This might include exercise, keeping healthy sleep patterns and energy-saving techniques. Your healthcare professional might suggest avoiding medications that can worsen fatigue.
Specialist fatigue management courses or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), might also help.
Visual problems
MS-related visual problems will often improve on their own, usually within a few weeks. If your symptoms are particularly severe, your healthcare professional might prescribe steroids.
If you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medication like gabapentin can sometimes help. Some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists).
Muscle spasms and stiffness
Physiotherapy can help improve muscle spasms and stiffness.
Techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.
If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.
These medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your specialist MS nurse.
Mobility problems
Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness can also cause mobility problems.
If you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest:
an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist
special exercises called vestibular rehabilitation, if you have problems with balance
medication for dizziness or tremors
mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair
home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings
An
occupational therapist
can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.
Musculoskeletal pain
Living with MS can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body.
A physiotherapist might be able to help with this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions.
If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves.
Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation.
This type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers.
Problems with thinking, learning and memory
Your MS healthcare professionals can assess your thinking, learning and memory problems and suggest ways to manage them.
Emotional problems
People with MS who have
depression
or
anxiety
can be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as CBT.
If you have emotional outbursts, such as laughing or crying for no clear reason, you should be assessed by a specialist. They may suggest treatment with an antidepressant.
Bladder problems
Medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.
If you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.
Sometimes a
catheter
can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC).
In rare cases, people with MS may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.
You might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. Read more about
treating urinary incontinence
.
Bowel problems
It might be possible to treat mild to moderate
constipation
by changing your diet or taking
laxatives
.
More severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools.
Anti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence.
Sexual problems
If you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help.
If you have MS and find it hard to get or maintain an erection (
erectile dysfunction
) you may be prescribed medication to increase the blood flow to the penis.
Speech and swallowing difficulties
A speech and language therapist can help you find ways to overcome problems with speech and swallowing.
For example, they can offer advice about foods that are easy to swallow. They might recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles used in speech and swallowing.
Complementary and alternative therapies for MS
Some people with MS find that
complementary therapies
help them feel better. Complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease symptoms, although scientific evidence is often not clear about how effective they are.
Many people think that complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, people can experience problems. It’s not a good idea to use them as an alternative to medicines prescribed by your doctor. If you’re considering an alternative treatment, it’s important to let your doctor know.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials have helped to improve the treatments available for MS.
Speak to your care team if you’re interested in taking part in a clinical trial.
Support for living with multiple sclerosis
Coming to terms with a long-term condition like MS can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. Be honest about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help.
If you have any questions, your MS nurse or GP can help and will let you know what support is available.
If you find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able to provide you with some help. Ask for a care and support needs assessment. For more information, read about
assessing your care and support needs
.
Having a baby
Being diagnosed with MS shouldn’t affect your ability to have children. Women with MS can have a normal pregnancy, deliver a healthy baby and breastfeed.
Some of the medications prescribed for MS aren’t suitable for taking during pregnancy or breastfeeding and might affect fertility in males and females. If you’re considering starting a family, discuss it with your healthcare team.
Having a baby doesn’t affect the long-term course of MS. Relapses can be less common in pregnancy, but they can be more common in the months after giving birth.
Money and financial support
If you have to stop work or work part-time because of your MS, you may find it hard to cope financially. You might be able to get
financial support
.
Driving
If you have MS, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and inform your insurance company.
You might be able to continue driving, but you’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition. You’ll be asked for details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/myasthenia-gravis/,"Myasthenia gravis
Myasthenia gravis is a long term (chronic) condition that causes muscle weakness and fatigue.
It’s a rare condition that commonly affects the muscles that control the eyes and eyelids. It can also affect the face, speaking, chewing, swallowing and other parts of the body.
It can affect people at any age, but is most often found in women under 40 and men over 60.
There are other rarer types of myasthenia which you can read about on
myaware
.
If you drive, you must inform the DVLA that you have myasthenia gravis.
Symptoms of myasthenia gravis
The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis are often droopy eyelids or double vision. It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body.
The severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It’s likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you’re tired. The symptoms might improve after resting.
Symptoms can include:
Eyes
You might experience droopy eyelids affecting one or both eyes, and double vision.
In some people, only the eye muscles are affected (ocular myasthenia).
In most people, the symptoms will spread to affect other parts of the body over time.
Swallowing, speaking and breathing
You might experience:
slurred speech
difficulty swallowing
difficulty making facial expressions like smiling
problems with chewing
a change in your voice
choking or accidentally inhaling food which can cause chest infections
shortness of breath
Limbs and neck
The muscle weakness might spread to other parts of the body like your arms, legs and neck.
You might experience:
weakness in your arms, legs, neck or other parts of your body
difficulty holding your head up
aching muscles
problems with tasks like climbing stairs or washing your hair
Myasthenic crisis
Some people can experience severe breathing and swallowing difficulties, which require immediate hospital treatment. This is called a myasthenic crisis.
It’s possible for patients to experience a myasthenic crisis before they know they have myasthenia gravis.
Phone 999 for an ambulance if:
you’re experiencing severe breathing or swallowing problems
You might need emergency hospital treatment.
You should avoid activities that could become dangerous if you experience sudden weakness, like swimming alone.
Diagnosing myasthenia gravis
It can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.
You might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.
Blood test
A blood test will look for a high level of antibodies (made by your immune system) which might be causing myasthenia gravis.
You might be offered another blood test at a later date if your initial blood test is normal but you continue to experience worsening symptoms.
Electromyography
You might have electromyography (an EMG) to test your nerves and muscles.
During electromyography, you’ll have small needles inserted into your muscles to measure their electric activity. These are usually inserted around your eyes, forehead or arms.
The test will measure the signals from the nerves to the muscles. If the test detects a disruption in the signals, this might be a sign of myasthenia gravis.
Scans
You might have a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
to check if the thymus gland in your chest is bigger than expected or has grown abnormally (a thymoma).
The thymus gland is part of your immune system. Problems with the thymus gland like inflammation (swelling), can be linked to myasthenia gravis.
An
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
might be used to check if your symptoms are being caused by an issue in your brain.
Treating myasthenia gravis
There are treatments available that can help reduce the affects of your symptoms.
If your symptoms get worse following certain triggers, you should try to avoid those triggers as much as possible.
Triggers might include:
stress
tiredness
infections
medicines
surgery
Treatment might include:
Medicine
Pyridostigmine
Sometimes myasthenia gravis can be treated with pyridostigmine alone. It works by temporarily improving the nerve to muscle transmission to help muscle strength.
It can reduce muscle weakness and for some people this is the only medication they need to control the condition.
It’s effects do not last long and it needs to be taken periodically throughout the day to give the best results.
Side effects can include stomach upset, diarrhoea and drooling.
Steroids
You might be advised to take steroid tablets like prednisolone if pyridostigmine isn’t helping.
Steroid tablets work by reducing the activity of your immune system to stop it attacking the communication between your nerves and muscles.
It’s likely you’ll be advised to take the tablets every other day. You’re likely to start at a low dose which will be built up quickly. This might gradually be reduced once your symptoms are under control. It’s important that you do not stop your steroids suddenly, as this can make you very ill.
Using steroids long term can cause side effects including
osteoporosis (weak bones)
, weight gain, infection and
diabetes
.
Read more about the side effects of steroids
Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressants work by reducing the activity of your immune system. Your healthcare team might suggest taking immunosuppressants if:
steroids aren’t controlling your symptoms
you need a high dose of steroids to control your symptoms
Commonly used immunosuppressants include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate.
You’ll need to take the tablets every day and it can take at least 9 months to feel the full effect. You’ll be advised to take steroids at first.
Immunosuppressants night cause side effects like:
loss of appetite and tiredness
feeling sick
increased risk of infections
You’ll have regular blood tests to check the the medicine isn’t causing any harm.
You might be able to stop taking immunosuppressants if they keep your symptoms under control over a few years.
Surgery
Your healthcare team might recommend surgery to remove the thymus gland (thymectomy).
Symptoms should improve within the first few months after surgery and can continue to improve for up to 2 years.
Surgery can reduce:
the dose of steroids
the need to take other immunosuppressants
the chances of needing to go to hospital because of worsening symptoms
Surgery might not help myasthenia symptoms in someone that has a thymoma. Your healthcare team might still recommend having your thymus gland removed because it can cause problems if it keeps growing.
Your thymectomy will usually be carried out through keyhole surgery. The thymus is removed using surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the chest.
Plasma exchange and IVIG
Plasma exchange and IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) can offer a quick improvement (within a few days) for people with myasthenia gravis who are particularly unwell or are having a myasthenic crisis.
Plasma exchange is an emergency treatment that removes antibodies from your own blood. This treatment is given in hospital and the benefits can last around 6 weeks.
IVIG treatment involves an injection of normal antibodies from donated blood to temporarily change the way your immune system works.
The two treatments are similar and your healthcare team will decide which is the best option for you. Although the benefits only last a few weeks, it can give time for the longer term treatments to take effect and help improve symptoms.
You might find that, during pregnancy or after having a baby, your myasthenia gravis worsens. If you’re planning a pregnancy or become pregnant, you should speak to your healthcare team. Don’t stop taking your medications without first speaking to your healthcare professional."

Nasal and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small, air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead).
It’s a rare type of cancer that most often affects men aged 50 to 60.
Nasal and sinus cancer is different to cancer in the area where the nose and throat connect. This is called
nasopharyngeal cancer
.
Symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer
The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are:
a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects 1 side
nosebleeds
mucus draining from the nose, which may be blood-stained
a decreased sense of smell
These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a
cold
or
sinusitis
.
At a later stage, symptoms can include:
pain or numbness in the face
swollen glands
in the neck
partial loss of vision or double vision
a bulging or persistently watering eye
a lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth
When to speak to your GP
Speak to your GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. They’re very unlikely to be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but are worth getting checked out.
If your GP thinks you might need some tests to determine what’s causing your symptoms, you’ll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant in hospital.
Tests you may have include:
a nasal endoscopy – where a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a light source is inserted into your nose to examine the area
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
and a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
a
biopsy
(where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined) – this may be done during an endoscopy or using a needle
Who’s at risk of nasal and sinus cancer
Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer, including:
your gender – men are more likely to develop nasal and sinus cancer than women
prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work, including wood dust, leather dust, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde
smoking
– the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer
human papilloma virus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has produced a
report on the risk of occupational nasal and sinus cancer in Great Britain (PDF, 2Mb)
.
Treatments for nasal and sinus cancer
The best treatment depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.
Treatment may include:
surgery to remove a tumour – which can be performed using surgical incisions (open surgery) or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery)
radiotherapy
– where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small amounts of a tumour that may be left after surgery
chemotherapy
– where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or to reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery
Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who will discuss the treatment options with you. A combination of treatments will often be recommended."

About non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.
The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.
In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.
The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Who’s affected?
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected.
What causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma?
The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you:
have a medical condition that weakens your immune system
take immunosuppressant medication
have previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes
glandular fever
You also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition.
Read more about the
causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
How non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed
The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a
biopsy
.
This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.

Treatment and outlook
There are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of 2 broad categories:
high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively
low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years
The outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type, grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person’s age.
Low-grade tumours don’t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.
The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:
chemotherapy
radiotherapy
a type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy
Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about
the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma
on the Cancer Research UK website.
However, there’s a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including
infertility
and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.

Information about you
If you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register
.
Symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.
Lymph nodes, also known as lymph glands, are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection.
The swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell, known as lymphocytes, collecting in the lymph node.
However, it’s highly unlikely you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma if you have
swollen lymph nodes
, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.
Other symptoms
Some people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:
night sweats
unintentional weight loss
a high temperature (fever)
a persistent
cough
or feeling of
breathlessness
persistent itching of the skin all over the body
Other symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have
abdominal pain
or
indigestion
.
A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to:
persistent tiredness or fatigue
an increased risk of infections
excessive bleeding – such as
nosebleeds
, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin
When to seek medical advice
Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.
While the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it’s best to get them checked out.
Causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The exact reason why this happens isn’t known.
DNA gives cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions, so the cells keep growing. This causes them to multiply uncontrollably.
The abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:
bone marrow
spleen
liver
skin
lungs
However, in some cases, non-Hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout the body).
Who’s most at risk?
While the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:
having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as
HIV
having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant
having an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such as
rheumatoid arthritis
,
lupus
or
Sjogren’s syndrome
being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus – a common virus that causes
glandular fever
being previously exposed to the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)
having a Helicobacter pylori infection – a common bacterial infection that usually infects the lining of the stomach and small intestine
having received
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
for an earlier cancer
having
coeliac disease
– an adverse reaction to gluten that causes inflammation of the small bowel
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and isn’t thought to run in families, although your risk may be slightly increased if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but most cases are diagnosed in people over 65. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.
Diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma
If you see your GP because you’re concerned about symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, they’ll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.
If necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests.
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.
To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected non-Hodgkin lymphoma, read the
NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
If you’re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Biopsy
A
biopsy
involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.
Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a
local anaesthetic
(where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and a
general anaesthetic
may be required (where you’re asleep).
A pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.
Types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including:
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
follicular lymphoma
extranodal marginal zone B-cell (MALT)
mantle cell lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma
mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma
small lymphocytic lymphoma
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma
peripheral T-cell lymphoma
skin (cutaneous) lymphomas
anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
lymphoblastic lymphoma
The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more detailed information on the
different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Further testing
If a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be required to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.
Further tests may include:
blood tests
– samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidney are working
bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic
chest
X-ray
– this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
– this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it’s usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working
lumbar puncture – using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cells
Stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
When the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. ‘Staging’ means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread.
The main stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are.
stage 1 – the cancer is limited to 1 group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)
stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm
stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm
stage 4 – the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow
Health professionals also add the letter ‘A’ or ‘B’ to your stage to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.
‘A’ is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. ‘B’ is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.
In some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. For example, ‘E’ (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system.
Grading non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Testing can also help health professionals decide the ‘grade’ of the cancer. There are two main grades of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:
low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years
high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively
Low-grade tumours don’t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated immediately, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.
In some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time.

treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with cancer-killing medication or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away.
In a few cases, if the initial cancer is very small and can be removed during a
biopsy
, no further treatment may be needed.
Your treatment plan
The recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, as many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.
Discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Your MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you. However, you shouldn’t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.
You’ll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins.
You can ask your care team if a clinical trial is available to take part in.
Wait-and-see approach
If the disease is low-grade (slow developing) and you’re well, a period of ‘watchful waiting’ is often recommended. This is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary.
If watchful waiting is recommended, you’ll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a widely used treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which involves using medicine to kill cancer cells. It may be used on its own, combined with biological therapy and/or combined with radiotherapy (see below).
The medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.
If doctors think your cancer is curable, you’ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.
If there’s a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine.
Chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome, and a longer hospital stay may be needed.
Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:
fatigue
breathlessness
increased vulnerability to infection
bleeding and bruising more easily
If you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.
Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include:
nausea and vomiting
diarrhoea
loss of appetite
mouth ulcers
tiredness
skin rashes
hair loss
infertility
, which may be temporary or permanent
Most side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. Tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
High-dose chemotherapy
If non-Hodgkin lymphoma doesn’t get better with initial treatment (known as ‘refractory’ lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose.
However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
is most often used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in 1 part of the body.
Treatment is normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You should not have to stay in hospital between appointments.
Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.
Other common side effects include:
sore and red skin in the treatment area
tiredness
nausea and vomiting
dry mouth
loss of appetite
Most side effects are temporary, but there’s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.
Read more about:
side effects of radiotherapy
complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Monoclonal antibody therapy
For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody.
These medications attach themselves to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. They’re often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective.
For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy. This can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future.
One of the main monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab. This medication is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours.
Side effects of rituximab can include:
flu
-like symptoms, such as
headaches
, fever and chills
tiredness
nausea
an itchy rash
You may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab.
As rituximab has been so successful in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. You may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment.
Steroid medication
Steroid medication
is commonly used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective.
The steroid medication is normally given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. A short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have.
Common side effects of short-term steroid use include:
increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain
indigestion
problems sleeping
feeling agitated
On rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. Side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids.
The side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.
Follow-up
After your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. Following this, you’ll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a ‘relapse’).
These appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.

Complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Some people treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they’ve been cured.
Weakened immune system
Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you’re being treated.
However, your immune system will usually recover in the months and years after treatment.
If you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections, and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of
antibiotics
to prevent infections occurring.
It’s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications. This is particularly important in the first few months after treatment.
Symptoms of infection include:
a high temperature (fever)
headache
aching muscles
diarrhoea
tiredness
a painful blistering rash
Vaccination
You should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up to date.
However, it’s important to speak to your GP or care team about this because it may not be safe for you to have ‘live’ vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.
Examples of ‘live’ vaccines include the:
shingles
vaccine
BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)
MMR vaccine (against
measles
,
mumps
and rubella)
Infertility
Chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause
infertility
. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.
Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.
In some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.
Second cancers
Having treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. This is known as a ‘second cancer’.
The risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. This damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.
You can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.
You should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you’re invited to.
Other health problems
Treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain conditions at a younger age than normal, such as:
heart disease
lung disease
kidney disease
thyroid disease
diabetes
cataracts
Having a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk of
depression
.
You should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/mumps/,"Mumps
Mumps is an infection that spreads easily. It used to be common in children before the introduction of the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
.
Mumps usually clears within 1 or 2 weeks.
Symptoms of mumps
The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after you’re infected.
Mumps causes painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands). It gives a distinctive ‘hamster face’ appearance.
Other symptoms of mumps can include:
headaches
joint pain
feeling sick
dry mouth
mild stomach (abdominal) pain
feeling tired
loss of appetite
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above
These may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.
Sometimes, mumps doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms.
Phone your GP if:
you think you or your child might have mumps
you’ve been in close contact with someone who has mumps and you’re pregnant, and haven’t been fully vaccinated
Mumps is not usually serious, but it has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as
glandular fever
and
tonsillitis
.
You should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.
Diagnosing mumps
Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after:
seeing and feeling the swelling
looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth
checking your temperature to see if it’s higher than normal
If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection team (HPT).
Who’s affected?
Most cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the
MMR vaccine
.
Once you’ve had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again.
How mumps is spread
The mumps virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You can easily catch mumps by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth.
A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.
How to prevent spreading mumps to others
If you have mumps:
stay off school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop
regularly wash your hands with soap
use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze
avoid close contact with anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated
How mumps can be prevented
Mumps can be prevented by having the
MMR vaccine
.
This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.
You can be vaccinated at any age if you haven’t been fully vaccinated before.
Treatment for mumps
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.
Do
get plenty of bed rest
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration
use pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – aspirin shouldn’t be given to children under 16
apply a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain
eat foods that don’t need a lot of chewing, such as soup, mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs
Complications of mumps
Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person’s health. Serious complications are rare.
However, mumps can lead to viral
meningitis
if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females if the affected person has gone through puberty.
About 1 in 20 cases of mumps lead to
acute pancreatitis
. This is usually mild, but you may be admitted to hospital so your body functions can be supported until your pancreas recovers.
About 1 in 20 people with mumps experience some temporary
hearing loss
, but permanent loss of hearing is rare."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/neuroendocrine-tumours/,"Neuroendocrine tumours
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.
The neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream.
NETs are tumours (abnormal growths) that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.
NETs can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and often – but not always – grow slowly. There are a number of different types of NET, depending on the specific cells affected.
Types of neuroendocrine tumours
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas.
Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas.
Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours develop in the lungs. Rarely, NETs can also develop in other parts of the body, including in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles.
Some NETs, known as functioning tumours, produce hormones that cause specific symptoms. Tumours that don’t cause symptoms are known as non-functioning tumours.
Symptoms of neuroendocrine tumours
The symptoms of a neuroendocrine tumour can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces.
For example, a tumour in the digestive system may cause
diarrhoea
,
constipation
or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent
cough
.
Some tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream.
This can cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing,
low blood sugar
(hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems.
What causes neuroendocrine tumours?
What causes neuroendocrine tumours isn’t fully understood. However, your chance of developing a NET is increased if you have one of the following rare conditions or syndromes:
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) – a rare inherited condition where tumours in the endocrine system develop, most commonly in the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland and the pancreas
neurofibrmatosis type 1 – a group of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along your nerves
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) – an inherited condition that causes blood vessels to grow abnormally
Research has also shown that your risk of developing a NET is slightly increased if one of your parents has had one in the past.
Diagnosing neuroendocrine tumours
There are many tests that can be used to diagnose NETs, including
blood tests
, urine tests, scans, and a
biopsy
(where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination).
Different types of scans may also be used to identify or examine tumours. These include:
ultrasound scans
– including echocardiograms and endoscopic ultrasound scans
computerised tomography (CT) scans
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
positron emission tomography (PET) scans
octreotide scans – where mild radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and a special camera is used to highlight any cancerous cells
Treating neuroendocrine tumours
How a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your individual circumstances. For example, your treatment will depend on:
where the tumour is
how advanced your condition is
your overall health
Unfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after other parts of their body are affected. However, it may still be possible to surgically remove the tumour, even if it has spread to other parts of your body.
If surgery can’t be used to completely cure your condition, it may be used to help manage and reduce any symptoms that you have.
It may also be possible to shrink the tumour or stop further growth using treatments that block the blood supply to the tumour (embolisation), or
chemotherapy
,
radiotherapy
or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells).

Most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. It’s the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.
‘Neuro’ means nerve
‘Blast’ means cells in early development
‘Oma’ means a group of cells, or a tumour
Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin.
Causes
As with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. It is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumour is:
if the tumour is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing)
if the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing
if the tumour occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing
occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps
if the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)
your child may be found to have high blood pressure
very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma
There are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort.
How is neuroblastoma diagnosed?
A variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. These include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, X-rays, CT or MRI scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an MIBG scan. These tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. This process is known as staging.
A specific type of urine test will also be done. Nearly all children with neuroblastoma (9 out of 10) will have substances called vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), or homovanillic acid (HVA), in their urine. Measuring the VMA and HVA in the urine can help to confirm the diagnosis. Your child will also have their VMA and HVA levels checked during and after treatment. The levels of these substances will fall if the treatment is working. As these chemicals are produced by the tumour cells, and can be used to measure tumour activity, they are sometimes known as tumour markers.
Most children will have an MIBG (meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine) scan. MIBG is a substance that’s taken up by neuroblastoma cells. It’s given by injection into the blood stream. Attaching a small amount of radioactive iodine to the MIBG enables any neuroblastoma tissue to be seen by a radiation scanner. Sometimes MIBG can be used as a treatment.
Biopsy
A small sample of cells (a
biopsy
) is usually taken from the tumour during an operation under a general anaesthetic. These cells are then examined under a microscope. Other tests collectively referred to as tumour biology, look at the chromosomes and ‘biological markers’ in the tumour cells. One of these ‘markers’ is called MYCN. The presence of a certain amount of MYCN in the cells (known as MYCN amplification) can suggest that the neuroblastoma may be a more aggressive type. In this situation, the treatment needs to be more intensive.
Staging
The ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the best treatment for your child.
Stage 1
The cancer is contained within 1 area of the body (localised) and there’s no evidence of it having spread. It can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left.
Stage 2A
The cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery.
Stage 2B
The cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 3
The cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body.
Stage 4
The cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs.
Stage 4S (also called special neuroblastoma)
This stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under 1 year old. The cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2A or 2B) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow.
A newer staging system has been developed by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG). This system is now widely used. It looks at whether or not certain ‘image-defined risk factors’ are present in a neuroblastoma tumour before treatment. These risk factors can be detected by scans and help doctors understand the extent of the disease. Your doctor can explain more about this.
Stage L1
The tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. It can be removed by surgery.
Stage L2
The tumour is localised but has ‘image-defined risk factors’ and can’t be safely removed by surgery.
Stage M
The tumour has spread to other parts of the body.
Stage MS
The tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old.
If the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, this is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.
Treatment
The treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the MYCN status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread.
Surgery
For tumours that have not spread (localised tumours), the treatment is usually surgery. If the tumour is at an early stage and there is no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes or any other parts of the body, an operation to remove the tumour, or as much of it as possible, will be undertaken. If the tumour is, at first, too large or in too difficult a position to remove safely, chemotherapy will be given to shrink it before surgery. A cure is usually possible for children with localised tumours. However, if a localised tumour is classed as ‘high-risk’, due to the tumour biology results, additional treatment with chemotherapy and usually radiotherapy will be needed.
Chemotherapy
If the tumour has already spread by the time of diagnosis, or is indicated as being high-risk by the tumour biology result, intensive
chemotherapy
is needed. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually given as an infusion into a vein. Your child will have a semi-permanent cannula called a central venous line inserted under a general anaesthetic to minimise the distress caused by intravenous injections.
Your child’s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
If the neuroblastoma has spread to several parts of the body, or is high-risk with MYCN amplification, high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue is used after the initial courses of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy will wipe out any remaining neuroblastoma cells but will also wipe out the body’s bone marrow, where blood cells are made. To prevent the problems this causes, stem cells (blood cells at their earliest stages of development) are collected from your child through a drip before the chemotherapy is given. These stem cells are then frozen and stored until required. After the high-dose chemotherapy, the stem cells are given back to your child through a drip. They make their way into the bone marrow, where they grow and develop into mature blood cells over a period of 14 to 21 days.
Monoclonal antibody treatment
Monoclonal antibodies can destroy some types of cancer cells while causing little harm to normal cells. In the UK, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated in the (SIOPEN) European high-risk clinical trial receive immunotherapy with a monoclonal antibody called anti-GD2 after their high dose therapy. There is good evidence from a clinical trial (research study) carried out in America, which was first reported on in 2009, that this may be a promising therapy when given alongside standard treatment for neuroblastoma. The anti GD2 is either given on its own or with cytokines. It is not yet a standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma as it has very unpleasant side effects, the benefits need to be fully proven and the best way to administer it needs to be established. It is therefore currently only available to patients in the UK who are being treated within a clinical trial. Your child’s specialist will be able to tell you much more about this treatment.
Radiotherapy
External beam
radiotherapy
may be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. This uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. External beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive MIBG. Radioactive MIBG is similar to the MIBG used in an investigation to diagnose neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells.
Younger children
Children under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have ‘low-risk’ tumours, and as long as there is no MYCN amplification, their outlook is excellent. Most children in this age group are cured.
Children with Stage 4S disease almost always get better with very little treatment or none at all. These tumours either regress spontaneously or after chemotherapy, which is only given if there are symptoms from the tumour. They disappear completely or develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumour, called a ganglioneuroma. Many of these children, after their initial diagnostic tests and staging investigations, will just need careful monitoring for some years. Ganglioneuromas are usually harmless and will not cause any problems and do not need any treatment.
Side effects of chemotherapy treatment
Chemotherapy often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. The side effects will depend upon the actual drugs being given. Immediate side effects can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
diarrhoea
weight loss
hair loss
increased risk of infection
bruising and bleeding
tiredness
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years after treatment. These include a change in the way the heart and kidneys work, hearing problems, fertility problems, a possible reduction in bone growth if radiotherapy has been given, and a slightly increased risk of developing another cancer in later life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors organise many trials for children’s cancer. Children in the UK with neuroblastoma can take part in national and European studies. The European research group is called SIOPEN. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Follow-up after treatment usually involves regular visits to the hospital outpatients department, with scans and urine tests as necessary. For children who have had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, more specialised tests may also be carried our. For example, hearing tests, kidney and heart function tests, and checking hormone levels. These will be repeated until your child is grown up. If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease. This is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. The lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels.
Lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you’re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin.
The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50 nodes.
Cancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. There are 2 main types of lymphoma:
Hodgkin lymphoma
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
Although they’re both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.
There are 2 main types of NHL. B-cell NHL usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. T-cell NHL usually affects lymph nodes in the chest.
Occasionally, NHL can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. This is called extranodal lymphoma.
Causes
We don’t know what causes NHL but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. It’s important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer.
Signs and symptoms
The first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid).
How it’s diagnosed
A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (
biopsy
). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging.
Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.
Staging
The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. The type of treatment your child receives depends on the stage of the disease.
Stage 1
One group of lymph nodes is affected, or there’s a single extranodal tumour.
Stage 2
Two or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing).
Stage 3
There’s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest.
Stage 4
The lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system.
Treatment
Treatment for NHL has a very good success rate and many people are cured.
Chemotherapy
is the most important treatment for children with NHL. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.
It’s common for a combination of drugs to be used and treatment may last a number of months or years. The treatment will be planned according to your child’s particular type of NHL and the stage of the disease. B-cell NHL is treated with 4 to 8 courses of intensive chemotherapy. T-cell NHL is treated for about 2 years. Your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.
NHL can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. To stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.
Very rarely,
radiotherapy
is also necessary. Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.
High-dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant is sometimes used (again very rarely) if the NHL comes back (recurs) after initial treatment.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment for NHL can cause different side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the part of the body that’s being treated and what treatment is being used. Some children have just a few side effects, while others experience more.
Side effects can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting
a sore mouth
temporary
hair loss
a low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed)
tiredness
diarrhoea
Late side effects
Months or years later some children will develop late side effects from the treatment they have had. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart, lungs and kidneys work, and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.
After treatment with chemotherapy, some children – particularly boys – may become infertile. Older boys, and their parents, should be aware of the option of sperm banking. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.
Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Cancer research trials are carried out
to try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Clinical trials mean there are now better results for curing children’s cancers compared with just a few years ago. Your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/nasopharyngeal-cancer/,"Nasopharyngeal cancer
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (the pharynx).
Nasopharyngeal cancer shouldn’t be confused with other types of cancer that also affect the throat, such as
laryngeal cancer
and
oesophageal cancer
.
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer
It’s often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don’t have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:
a lump in the neck
hearing loss
– usually only in 1 ear
tinnitus
– hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source
a blocked or stuffy nose
nosebleeds
Speak to your GP if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don’t improve after a few weeks. While they’re very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.
What causes nasopharyngeal cancer?
The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:
being of south Chinese or north African descent
having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish
being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes
glandular fever
having a job where you’re regularly exposed to hardwood dust
having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who’s had the condition
Being exposed to the human papilloma virus (HPV) may also increase your risk of developing certain types of nasopharyngeal cancer.
About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer. The average age at diagnosis is about 50.
Diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer
If you see your GP with symptoms that could indicate nasopharyngeal cancer, they’ll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light.
If your GP thinks further tests are necessary, they’ll refer you to hospital. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions.
Some of the tests you may have include:
a nasendoscopy – where a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is inserted up your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; it’s carried out while you’re awake, but
local anaesthetic
can be used to numb your nose and throat
imaging scans –
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
or
computerised tomography (CT) scans
can be used to check for tumours and determine whether the cancer has spread
a panendoscopy – a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together
a
biopsy
– where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory
Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They’ll also be able to ‘stage’ the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer
.
How nasopharyngeal cancer is treated
If you’re diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case.
The 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are:
radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells
In most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used.
Surgery isn’t usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it’s difficult for surgeons to access the affected area.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.
In most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.
In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.
It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.
Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.
External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won’t need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments.
In some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.
Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.
Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:
red and sore skin in the treatment area
feeling sick
changes to your sense of taste
dry mouth
hair loss
These side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you experience these problems as treatment is often available to help.
Read more about
how radiotherapy is performed
and the
side effects of radiotherapy
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.
It’s usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight during treatment.
Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as:
feeling sick
diarrhoea
sore mouth
tiredness
These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins.

how chemotherapy is performed
and the
side effects of chemotherapy
Follow-up
After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll become gradually less frequent over time."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/menieres-disease/,"Meniere’s disease
Ménière’s disease is a rare inner ear condition that can affect your balance and hearing. It cannot be cured, but treatments can usually help your symptoms.
Ménière’s disease most commonly affects people aged 20 to 60. It’s slightly more common in women than men.
Symptoms of Ménière’s disease
The symptoms and severity of Ménière’s disease vary widely from person to person.
The main symptoms of Ménière’s disease are:
vertigo
– the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning
tinnitus
– hearing sounds from inside your body, rather than from an outside source
hearing loss
, with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds
a feeling of pressure or fullness deep inside the ear
feeling or being sick
Symptoms typically last around 2 to 3 hours. But it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely.
These symptoms usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears may become affected over time.
Other symptoms include:
sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis)
distorted sound
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
You or your child:
have any of the symptoms of Ménière’s disease
Diagnosing Ménière’s disease
There’s no single test for Ménière’s disease. It can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms.
Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if there’s a pattern.
For Ménière’s disease to be diagnosed, you’ll have had:
at least 2 episodes of
vertigo
lasting 20 minutes or more within a single Ménière’s disease attack
tests that confirm that
hearing loss
is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear)
tinnitus
or a feeling of pressure in your ear
Your GP may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
If needed, your GP can refer you to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests.
Treatment for Ménière’s disease
Ménière’s disease cannot be cured, but treatment can usually help your symptoms.
Possible treatments include:
medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks
changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet
treatment for tinnitus
treatment for hearing loss
balance training (vestibular rehabilitation)
relaxation techniques
surgery – only rarely, in more severe cases
Your mental health
Some people with Ménière’s disease also find that it affects their mental health.
Speak to your GP practice if you’re finding it difficult to cope with the effect Ménière’s disease is having on your life. There are also support groups that can help you.
Safety
If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example:
you should tell your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders
you may have a higher chance of falling – read about
preventing falls
for advice on reducing your risk
Driving and vertigo
If you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo.

What causes Ménière’s disease?
The exact cause of Ménière’s disease is unknown. It’s thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear.
Factors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière’s disease include:
a family history of the condition
a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/norovirus/,"Norovirus
Norovirus causes
diarrhoea
and
vomiting
and is one of the most common stomach bugs in the UK. It’s also called the ‘winter vomiting bug’ because it’s more common in winter, but you can catch it at any time of the year.
Norovirus can be very unpleasant but usually clears up by itself in a few days.
You can normally look after yourself or your child at home.
Avoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Phone your GP practice or NHS 24 on
111
if you’re concerned or need advice.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if you or your child:
vomit blood or have vomit that looks like ground coffee
have green vomit (adults)
have yellow-green or green vomit (children)
might have swallowed something poisonous
have a stiff neck and pain when looking at bright lights
have a sudden, severe headache or stomach ache
Find your nearest A&E
Phone 111 now if:
you’re worried about a baby under 12 months
your child stops breast or bottle feeding while they’re ill
a child under 5 years has signs of
dehydration
– such as fewer wet nappies
you or your child (over 5 years) still have signs of dehydration after using oral rehydration sachets
you or your child keep being sick and cannot keep fluid down
you or your child have bloody diarrhoea or bleeding from the bottom
you or your child have diarrhoea for more than 7 days or vomiting for more than 2 days
Symptoms of norovirus
You’re likely to have norovirus if you experience:
suddenly feeling sick
projectile
vomiting
watery
diarrhoea
Some people also have a slight fever,
headaches
, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.
The symptoms appear 1 to 2 days after you become infected and typically last for up to 2 or 3 days.
How is norovirus spread?
Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
You can catch it if small particles of vomit or stools (poo) from an infected person get into your mouth through:
close contact with someone with norovirus who may breathe out small particles of the virus that you then inhale
touching contaminated surfaces or objects, as the virus can survive outside the body for several days
eating contaminated food, which can happen if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands before preparing or handling food
Norovirus is most infectious from the start of symptoms until 48 hours after all symptoms have stopped. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.
You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing and your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it.
Preventing norovirus
It’s not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice can help stop the virus spreading. You should:
stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the norovirus symptoms have stopped
avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before preparing or handling food
be aware alcohol-based hand gels don’t kill the virus
Maintain basic hygiene and cleaning to help stop the spread of norovirus by:
disinfecting any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated, using a bleach-based household cleaner.
washing any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash (60°C) to ensure the virus is killed.
not sharing towels and flannels
flushing any poo or vomit in the toilet and cleaning the surrounding area with a bleach-based household cleaner
avoiding eating raw, unwashed food
only eating oysters from a reliable source as they can carry norovirus
What to do if you have norovirus
If you experience sudden diarrhoea and/or vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better.
There’s no treatment for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course.
You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup.
Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.
You can also:
take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains
get plenty of rest
use special rehydration drinks, available from community pharmacies if you have signs of
dehydration
, such as a dry mouth or dark urine
If you feel like eating, try plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.
Babies and young children, especially under a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.
When to get medical advice
You don’t normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there’s no specific treatment for it.
Antibiotics
won’t help because norovirus is caused by a virus."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It’s usually seen in people who are overweight or obese.
A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It’s estimated that up to 1 in every 3 people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver.
Early-stage NAFLD doesn’t usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including
cirrhosis
, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as
diabetes
,
heart attacks
and
strokes
.
If detected and managed at an early stage, it’s possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver.
Stages of NAFLD
NAFLD develops in 4 main stages.
Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed.
The main stages of NAFLD are:
simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)– a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population
fibrosis – where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally
cirrhosis
– the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and
liver cancer
It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It’s important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.
Am I at risk of NAFLD?
You’re at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:
are
obese
or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an ‘apple-like’ body shape)
have
type 2 diabetes
have
high blood pressure
have
high cholesterol
are over the age of 50
smoke
However, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children.
Although it’s very similar to
alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD)
, NAFLD isn’t caused by drinking too much alcohol.
Symptoms of NAFLD
There aren’t usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won’t know you have it unless it’s diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.
Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience:
a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
unexplained weight loss
weakness
If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy.
Read more about the
symptoms of cirrhosis
.
How NAFLD is diagnosed
NAFLD is often diagnosed after a
blood test
called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don’t always pick up NAFLD.
The condition may also be spotted during an
ultrasound scan
of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.
If you’re diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (
biopsy
) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.
Treatment for NAFLD
Most people with NAFLD won’t develop any serious problems, but if you’re diagnosed with the condition it’s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.
There’s currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.
You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems.
Healthy diet and lifestyle
Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. The following can all help.
Lose weight
– you should aim for a
BMI
of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it.
Eat a healthy diet
– try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too.
Exercise regularly
– aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don’t lose weight.
Stop smoking
– if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
NAFLD isn’t caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. It’s therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some
tips on cutting down on alcohol
.
Medication
There isn’t currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition.
For example, your doctor may recommend medication to
treat high blood pressure
,
treat high cholesterol
,
treat type 2 diabetes
and/or
treat obesity
.
Liver transplant
If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.
For adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors.
Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor’s liver are able to regrow to a normal size.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/nosebleed/,"Nosebleed
Nosebleeds are not usually a sign of anything serious. You can often treat them at home.
During a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light. It can last from a few seconds to 15 minutes or more.
How to stop a nosebleed
To stop a nosebleed:
Sit down at a table, lean forward and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10 to 15 minutes.
Lean forward and breathe through your mouth. Spit out any blood that collects in your throat or mouth into a bowl. Do not swallow any blood.
Place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on your forehead or back of your neck.
Stay upright or seated, rather than lying down, to reduce the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and help reduce further bleeding.
If the bleeding eventually stops, you won’t usually need to seek medical advice. But in some cases you may need further treatment from your GP or in hospital.
When to get medical advice
Go to A&E or phone 999 if:
the bleeding continues for longer than 20 minutes
the bleeding is heavy and you’ve lost a lot of blood
you’re having difficulty breathing
you’re feeling weak or dizzy
you swallow a large amount of blood that makes you vomit
the nosebleed developed after a serious injury, such as a car crash
Speak to your GP practice if:
you’re taking a blood-thinning medicine (anticoagulant) such as warfarin
you have a condition that means your blood cannot clot properly, such as haemophilia
you have symptoms of
anaemia
such as heart palpitations,
shortness of breath
and a pale complexion
a child under 2 has a nosebleed
you have nosebleeds that come and go regularly
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
What causes nosebleeds?
There are delicate blood vessels in your nose that can become damaged and bleed quite easily.
Common causes of nosebleeds include:
picking your nose
blowing your nose very hard
recently drinking alcohol
a minor injury to your nose
changes in humidity or temperature causing the inside of the nose to become dry and cracked
Occasionally, bleeding can come from the blood vessels deeper within the nose. This can be caused by a blow to the head, recent nasal surgery or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).
Who gets nosebleeds?
Nosebleeds are fairly common. Most people will get them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect:
children aged between 2 and 10
elderly people
pregnant women
people who take blood thinning medication such as
aspirin
or anticoagulants, such as warfarin
people with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia
Preventing nosebleeds
There are things you can do to prevent nosebleeds.
Do
avoid picking your nose and keep your fingernails short
blow your nose as little as possible and only very gently
keep your home humidified
wear a head guard during activities in which your nose or head could get injured
always follow the instructions that come with nasal decongestants – overusing these can cause nosebleeds
Talk to your GP if you often get nosebleeds and aren’t able to prevent them.
Treatment for nosebleeds
If you see your GP or go to hospital with a nosebleed, you’ll be assessed to find out how serious your condition is and what’s likely to have caused it. This may involve:
looking inside your nose
measuring your pulse and blood pressure
carrying out
blood tests
asking about any other symptoms you have
If needed, your doctor will discuss additional treatments with you. For example, ointments for your nose, cautery to seal blood vessels in your nose or nasal packing may be required."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/osteosarcoma/,"Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. Osteosarcomas occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under 5.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments. But it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Osteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. Any bone in the body can be affected. The most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints.
There are several different types of osteosarcoma. Most occur in the centre of the bone. There are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma.
Causes
There has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. There are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. Children who have hereditary
retinoblastoma
(a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour.
Signs and symptoms
Pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis.
These symptoms can be caused by many things other than cancer. However, any persistent bone pain should be checked by your child’s doctor. Symptoms are often attributed to a sporting injury.
How osteosarcoma is diagnosed
Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests.
The doctor at the hospital will take your child’s full medical history. They will then do a physical examination. This will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. Your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health.
A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose osteosarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see.
A small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It’s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic.
Other tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. These include a chest
X-ray
,
blood tests
, a bone scan and an
MRI
or
CT scan
.
Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.
Grading
Grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. Low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread.
In high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread.
Most osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade.
Staging
The ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.
Most patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease).
A staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below:
Stage 1A
The cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone.
Stage 1B
The cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels.
Stage 2A
The cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone.
Stage 2B
The cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Most osteosarcomas are stage 2B.
Stage 3
The cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started.
If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.
Treatment
Treatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a very important part of treatment for osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells, and is usually given to shrink the main tumour before surgery. It’s also given after the tumour has been removed by surgery, to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). It’s common for a combination of drugs to be used.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
may occasionally be given. This treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.
Surgery
The type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. This surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one.
Surgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery.
Amputation
Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.
After amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs can work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports.
Limb-sparing surgery
There are 2 ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done:
replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)
replacing the affected bone with bone taken from another part of the body (bone graft)
After this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. However, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. This is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it.
If your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. This may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure.
New treatments for osteosarcoma
Mifamurtide, also called Mepact®, is a new type of biological therapy treatment. It may be offered to your child if they have had a surgical resection to remove the osteosarcoma and the tumour has not spread. It will be given along with chemotherapy after surgery to try and stop the osteosarcoma coming back. Mifamurtide is a relatively new drug and so more research needs to be done to fully understand its side effects and how to use it best.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend upon the treatment being given and the part of the body that’s being treated.
Chemotherapy side effects
Some general side effects of chemotherapy can include:
feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)
hair loss
increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness
diarrhoea
Radiotherapy side effects
Radiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness.
Surgery side effects
If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.
Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial, if there is a suitable one open. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Your child’s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Many children with osteosarcoma are cured. However, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. Your child will have regular check-ups and X-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition. It causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and carry out compulsive activity.
This can be distressing and can have a big impact on your life. Treatment can help you keep it under control.
Symptoms of OCD
OCD affects people differently. It usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.
This pattern has 4 main steps:
Obsession – where an intrusive, distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind.
Anxiety – the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress.
Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel you have to do as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession.
Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief, but the obsession and anxiety return, causing the cycle to begin again.
Obsessive thoughts
Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.
Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.
If you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.
Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:
fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you
fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on
fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance
a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way
Compulsive behaviour
Compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.
For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.
Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.
Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.
Related problems
Some people with OCD may also have or develop other mental health problems, including:
depression
eating disorders
generalised anxiety disorder
a hoarding disorder
People with OCD and severe depression might also have
suicidal
feelings.
Causes of OCD
The exact cause of OCD is not known. There are some factors that could make a person more likely to have OCD.
These factors might include:
genetics
life events
personality traits
chemical differences in the brain
Diagnosing OCD
Diagnosis and treatment can help to reduce the impact of OCD on your day-to-day life.
Speak to your GP if:
you think you might have OCD
Many people do not tell their GP about their symptoms because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. They may also try to disguise their symptoms from family and friends.
If you have OCD, you should not feel ashamed or embarrassed. Like
diabetes
or
asthma
, it’s a long-term health condition, and it’s not your fault you have it.
Your GP will probably ask you a series of questions to see if it’s likely you have OCD.
If the results of the initial screening questions suggest you have OCD, the severity of your symptoms will be assessed. Either your GP or a mental health professional will carry out the assessment.
It’s important you’re open and honest. Accurate and truthful responses will ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment.
If you think someone you know may have OCD, it’s a good idea to:
talk to them carefully about your concerns
suggest they speak to their GP
Treating OCD
Treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) depends on the how much the condition is affecting your daily life.
The 2 main treatments are:
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
medication
If your OCD has a severe impact on your daily life, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist mental health service. Here you’ll likely receive a combination of intensive CBT and a course of antidepressants called
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
.
Children with OCD are usually referred to a healthcare professional with experience of treating OCD in children.
It can take several months before a treatment has a noticeable effect.
Further treatment
You might be offered specialist treatment if you’ve tried other treatments and your OCD is still not under control.
Most people improve after receiving treatment.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/oral-thrush-in-adults/,"Oral thrush in adults
Oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. It’s not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication.
It’s also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it’s caused by a group of yeasts called Candida.
Contact your GP practice if:
You develop symptoms of oral thrush, which can include:
white patches (plaques) in the mouth that can often be wiped off, leaving behind red areas that may bleed slightly
loss of taste or an unpleasant taste in the mouth
redness inside the mouth and throat
cracks at the corners of the mouth
a painful, burning sensation in the mouth
In some cases, the symptoms of oral thrush can make eating and drinking difficult.
If left untreated, the symptoms will often persist and your mouth will continue to feel uncomfortable.
In severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious.
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. Sometimes they may also recommend
blood tests
to look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such as
diabetes
and nutritional deficiencies.
What causes oral thrush?
Low numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. They don’t usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply.
There are a number of reasons why this may happen, including:
taking a course of
antibiotics
, particularly over a long period or at a high dose
taking
inhaled corticosteroid medication
for
asthma
wearing
dentures
(false teeth), particularly if they don’t fit properly
having poor oral hygiene
having a dry mouth, either because of a medical condition or a medication you are taking
smoking
having
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
to treat
cancer
Babies, young children and elderly people are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush, as are people with certain underlying conditions, including diabetes, an
iron deficiency
or
vitamin B12 deficiency
, an
underactive thyroid
(hypothyroidism) and
HIV
.
As most people already have Candida fungi living in their mouth, oral thrush is not contagious. This means it cannot be passed to others.
Treating oral thrush
Oral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used.
Topical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around 7 to 14 days. Tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily.
These medications don’t often have side effects, although some can cause nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating,
abdominal (tummy) pain
and
diarrhoea
.
If antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine – or the way it is delivered – may need to be changed or the dosage reduced.
Preventing oral thrush
There are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush.
Do
rinse your mouth after meals
brush your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride
floss regularly
visit your dentist regularly for check-ups, even if you wear dentures or have no natural teeth
remove your dentures every night and clean them with paste or soap and water before soaking them in a solution of water and denture-cleaning tablets
brush your gums, tongue and inside your mouth with a soft brush twice a day if you wear dentures or have no or few natural teeth
visit your dentist if your dentures do not fit properly
stop smoking if you smoke
rinse your mouth with water and spit it out after using a corticosteroid inhaler, and use a spacer (a plastic cylinder that attaches to the inhaler) when you take your medicine
ensure that any underlying condition you have, such as diabetes, is well controlled
If you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening.

About ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has been through the
menopause
(usually over the age of 50). It can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age.
As the
symptoms of ovarian cancer
can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating.
It’s important to speak to your GP if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a long period of time. Read more about
how ovarian cancer is diagnosed
.
The ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation.
Different types of ovarian cancer
affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer.
What causes ovarian cancer?
The exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman’s risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past. However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link.
Read more about the
causes of ovarian cancer
Treating ovarian cancer
The treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your cancer and your general health.
Chemotherapy
is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.
Read more about
how ovarian cancer is treated
As with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it’s at when diagnosed – that is, how far the cancer has advanced.
Being diagnosed with ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of living with ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues.
Ovarian cancer screening
There are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven’t been fully tested. Screening is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene. Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. A
cervical screening test
, which used to be called a smear test, can’t detect ovarian cancer.

preventing ovarian cancer
Symptoms of ovarian cancer
The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages.
This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS).
However, 3 main symptoms are more frequent:
increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)
persistent pelvic and abdominal pain
difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous
Other symptoms, such as back pain, needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be a sign of ovarian cancer.
If you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. Bear in mind that ovarian cancer is rare in women and anyone with ovaries under 40 years of age.
Speak to your GP if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for 3 weeks or more). Although it’s unlikely they’re being caused by a serious problem, it’s best to check.
If you’ve already seen your GP and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. You know your body better than anyone.
Causes of ovarian cancer
Several possible causes of ovarian cancer have been identified, along with risks that may make developing the condition more likely.
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
In ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. If the cancer isn’t identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system.
Increased risk
The exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn’t known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it.
Age
Your risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after the
menopause
. Most cases of ovarian cancer occur in women and anyone with ovaries who are over 50 years of age.
Family history
If you have 2 or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer or
breast cancer
, your risk of also developing the condition may be increased.
If your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it’s more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. They’re also known to increase the risk of breast cancer.
Having relatives with ovarian cancer doesn’t mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family – the cancer could have happened by chance. Only 1 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene.
You may be at high risk of having a faulty gene if you have:
1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 2 close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother’s or father’s side)
1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 1 close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family
2 relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age
If you’re at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your GP can refer you for tests to check for faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
Ovulation and fertility
Every time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. The surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. Each time this happens, there’s a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair.
This may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take the
contraceptive pill
, or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. At these times, eggs aren’t released.
There’s no strong evidence to show that those who have infertility treatment have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, it’s thought that
infertility
itself may increase ovarian cancer risk and research into this area is being carried out.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Women and anyone with ovaries who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is stopped, after 5 years the risk is reduced to the same level as those who’ve never taken HRT.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis
may also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. In endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body.
These endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation, occurs in other parts of the body. There’s no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area.

Cancer Research UK:
Ovarian cancer risks and causes
Diagnosing ovarian cancer
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you have any
symptoms of ovarian cancer
.
Your GP will gently feel your tummy (abdomen) and ask you about your symptoms, general health and whether there’s a history of ovarian or
breast cancer
in your family.
They may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for an
ultrasound scan
.
If needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected ovarian cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
Blood test (CA125)
You may have a blood test to look for a protein called CA125 in your blood. CA125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells. A very high level of CA125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer.
However, CA125 isn’t specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions including
endometriosis
,
fibroids
, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy, so a raised CA125 level doesn’t definitely mean you have ovarian cancer.
The Lab Tests Online UK website has more information on the
CA125 test
.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance that recommends testing for CA125 if you frequently experience:
bloating
feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite
pelvic or abdominal pain
needing to urinate urgently and/or frequently
Read the full
NICE guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (PDF, 179kb)
.
If you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such as
diarrhoea
or
constipation
, you may also be tested for CA125.
If you’re 50 or over and you’ve experienced symptoms that could suggest
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your GP should test your CA125 level.
Around half of all women and anyone with ovaries with early-stage ovarian cancer have a raised level of CA125 in their blood. If your CA125 level is raised, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan.
Ultrasound scan
An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. You may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach.
The image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present.
Further tests
If you’ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and if it’s spread. This is called staging.
Other tests you may have include:
a chest
X-ray
a
CT scan
or
MRI scan
abdominal fluid aspiration – a thin needle is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells
laparoscopy – a thin tube with a camera on the end is inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (a
biopsy
)
Staging helps your doctors to decide on the best kind of treatment for your condition. However, it’s important to remember that the stage of your ovarian cancer alone cannot predict how your condition will progress.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information on
further tests for ovarian cancer
.
Stages and grades of ovarian cancer
Staging
If your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer, it will be given a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. The 4 commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are:
stage 1 – where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries
stage 2 – where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or womb
stage 3 – where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis
stage 4 – where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, spleen or lungs
This is a simplified guide. Each stage is further divided into categories A, B and C. Ask your doctor if you’re not sure what stage you have.
Grading
The grade of cancer refers to the appearance of cells under a microscope. The grades are as follows:
low grade – although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing
moderate grade – cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells
high grade – cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growing
The Cancer Research UK website has more information on the
stages and grading of ovarian cancer
.
Treating ovarian cancer
Surgery
Most people with ovarian cancer will be considered for surgery. It sometimes isn’t possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out.
Your doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. It will probably involve removing:
both ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy)
the womb (a total abdominal hysterectomy)
the omentum – a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy)
The surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread.
If it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. This is known as ‘debulking surgery’.
If the cancer is confined to 1 or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. This means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy.
You will probably be ready to go home 3 to 7 days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover.
When you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness.
Walking
and
swimming
are good exercises that are suitable for most people after treatment for ovarian cancer. Discuss the types of exercise that are suitable for you with your doctor or physiotherapist.

Cancer Research UK: Surgery for ovarian cancer

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill cancer cells. It’s often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. In some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. This is called ‘neoadjuvant chemotherapy’.
Several different medicines can be used in chemotherapy. A combination is often given. The choice of medicine and how and when it’s given depends on the stage of your cancer and how much it has spread. The most common treatment for ovarian cancer is a platinum-containing medicine (carboplatin), which is used alone or in combination with another medicine called paclitaxel.
Chemotherapy is usually given as a drip into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. Some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen – called ‘intraperitoneal chemotherapy’. It is not currently established routine practice in the UK, but it’s being assessed in clinical trials.
You’ll usually have chemotherapy as an outpatient, but you may sometimes need a short stay in hospital. It’s usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment followed by a period of rest, to allow the body to recover. Most women and anyone with ovaries have 6 cycles of chemotherapy.
Is chemotherapy working?
Over the course of your chemotherapy, you’ll have tests to monitor how the cancer is responding to treatment. This can be done in a number of ways. For example:
if you had higher than normal levels of the protein CA125 in your blood when diagnosed, you may have
blood tests
to see whether the levels are falling
if you had a tumour visible on a
CT scan
or
ultrasound scan
when diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk
you may have another small operation, known as ‘second-look surgery’, which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopy
After your chemotherapy treatment, if all of your tests are clear of cancer, you’ll be in remission. This means the cancer is under control.
Side effects of chemotherapy
Side effects of chemotherapy include:
infections
loss of appetite
nausea and vomiting
tiredness
hair loss
sore mouth
Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe.
Chemotherapy for recurring cancer
Ovarian cancer can come back (relapse) after treatment. If this happens, you may have another course of chemotherapy. This is called ‘second-line treatment’.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Macmillan Cancer Support: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high energy
X-rays
. Like chemotherapy, it works by targeting rapidly growing cancer cells.
Radiotherapy isn’t usually used to treat ovarian cancer. However, the multidisciplinary team may occasionally recommend it to treat ovarian cancer under very specific circumstances, such as treating pain and bleeding from a localised tumour mass.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK: radiotherapy for ovarian cancer
Macmillan Cancer Support: Ovarian cancer treatment
Clinical trials
In recent years, much progress has been made in ovarian cancer treatment. More women and anyone with ovaries are living longer and experiencing fewer side effects. These advances were discovered through clinical trials, where new medicines and combinations of medicines are compared with standard treatment.
All cancer trials in the UK are subject to careful monitoring, to ensure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials can often do better overall than in routine care.
If you’re asked about taking part in a trial, you’ll be offered an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you’ll be asked to give your consent (permission) by signing a form. You’re always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Cancer Research: ovarian cancer research
.
Psychological help
Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for patients and their families. It can bring emotional and practical difficulties.
It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support. For example:
your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor; talk to your GP if you’re feeling depressed; a course of
antidepressants
may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist
it can help to talk to someone who’s been through the same thing as you; many organisations have helplines and online forums; they can also put you in touch with other people who have had cancer treatment
Read further information:
Macmillan Cancer Support
Living with ovarian cancer
Recovery and follow-up
Many women and anyone with ovaries with ovarian cancer have a hysterectomy. This is a major operation and takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from.
During this time, you’ll have to avoid lifting things, such as children and heavy shopping bags, and doing heavy housework. You won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. You’ll usually need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy.
If your ovaries have been removed and you haven’t already been through the
menopause
, you’ll experience the menopause after your treatment. You may decide to take
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
to control your symptoms. Your GP will help you decide what’s best for you.
Some treatments for ovarian cancer, particularly
chemotherapy
, can make you feel very tired. You may need a break from your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.
Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse who to contact.
After your treatment has finished, you’ll be invited for regular check-ups to see how well you are responding to treatments. These are usually every 2 to 3 months to begin with.
Sex and relationships
Relationships with friends and family
Having cancer isn’t always easy to talk about, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people avoid you or feel awkward around you.
Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. However, don’t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself.
Read further information:
Talking to your kids about cancer
Macmillan Cancer Support: Talking about cancer
Your sex life
Ovarian cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life in several ways.
Early menopause
If you haven’t already been through the menopause, removing your ovaries means you’ll have an early menopause. You’re likely to have
symptoms of the menopause
, which can include vaginal dryness and
loss of sexual desire
.
Not feeling like sex
It’s common to lose interest in sex after treatment for ovarian cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired, and you may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer.
You may also feel grief about the loss of your fertility. It’s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Share your feelings with your partner. If your feelings about sex aren’t improving with time, you may want to consider speaking to a counsellor or sex therapist.
Money and benefits
If you have to reduce or stop working due to your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:
if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to
statutory sick pay (SSP)
from your employer
if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
employment and support allowance (ESR)
if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
carer’s allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or have a low household income
It’s a good idea to find out as soon as possible what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.
Read further information:
Money Advice Service
Target Ovarian Cancer: Financial hardship for women with ovarian cancer
Dealing with dying
If you’re told that nothing more can be done to treat your ovarian cancer, care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you feel as comfortable as possible. This is called
palliative care
. It also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.

Marie Curie Cancer Care: support for people dying at home
Preventing ovarian cancer
There’s currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. However, there are a number of things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.
Stopping ovulation and the contraceptive pill
Each time you ovulate, your ovaries are damaged by the egg as it breaks through the surface of the ovary and is released into your reproductive system.
The cells that make up the surface of your ovaries divide and multiply rapidly to repair the damage caused by the egg. It’s this rapid cell growth that can occasionally go wrong and result in ovarian cancer.
Anything that stops the process of ovulation can help to minimise your chances of developing ovarian cancer. This includes:
pregnancy and
breastfeeding
the
contraceptive pill
hysterectomy surgery (removal of the ovaries)
Diet and lifestyle
Ovarian cancer may be linked to being overweight or
obese
.
Losing weight
through
regular exercise
and a
healthy, balanced diet
may help lower your risk of getting ovarian cancer. Aside from this, regular exercise and a healthy, low-fat diet are extremely beneficial to your overall health, and can help to prevent all forms of cancer and
heart disease
.
Screening for ovarian cancer
At present, there’s no screening method for ovarian cancer that is reliable enough to be used by all women and anyone with ovaries in the UK. Clinical trials into this are continuing.
You may be eligible for screening if you’re at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history, or if you’ve inherited a specific abnormal gene.
If you’re at high risk, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service or family cancer clinic. You may be screened for ovarian cancer when you’re over the age of 35, or when you’re 5 years away from the age at which your youngest relative was diagnosed with the condition. From this point, you’ll be screened again once a year.
The screening tests for ovarian cancer are the same as those routinely used to diagnose it. The tests are:
a
blood test
for higher-than-normal levels of CA125 (a protein produced by cancer cells)
a transvaginal
ultrasound
– where an ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina so that the size and texture of your ovaries can be seen, as well as any
ovarian cysts
that may be present
The tests are used together to produce results that are as accurate as possible. However, as these screening methods are still in the process of being tested, there’s no guarantee they’ll identify every case of ovarian cancer.
A
cervical screening test
, previously known as a smear test, can’t detect ovarian cancer."

Introduction
This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called ovarian cancer.

For more information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general
ovarian cancer
section.
Ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.
Your reproductive system
Your reproductive system is made up of the:
vagina – the passage from the cervix to outside your body
cervix – the opening from the womb to the vagina
womb (also called uterus) – where a baby grows during pregnancy
fallopian tubes – which connect your ovaries to the womb
ovaries – which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty
Facts about ovaries
You have 2 ovaries – 1 on each side of your womb. They’re about 4cm long.
At puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.
Every month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb’s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man’s sperm. If this doesn’t happen, the womb’s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. This is a period.
When a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause.
Types of ovarian cancer
There are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours.
Teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called:
dysgerminoma
teratoma
yolk sac tumour
Germ cell tumours of the ovary are rare. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. Treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours.
Your specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have. If you have a type of ovarian cancer or germ cell tumour that’s not listed here, you can talk to one of Macmillan’s
cancer support specialists
to find out more.
Germ cell tumours of the ovary
This section is for teenagers and young adults.
Germ cell tumours of the ovary are the most common type of ovarian cancer in teenagers and young women. If you have a different type of ovarian cancer and want to know more you can
talk to Macmillan Cancer Support
.
Germ cell tumours are a rare type of ovarian cancer. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary in girls and young women (aged 10 to 30). Tumours are often only in 1 ovary. They can usually be successfully treated, even if they’ve spread to other places in the body.
Germ cell tumours can also develop in teenage boys’ or men’s testicles, or rarely in other parts of the body. This page is about germ cell tumours that start in the ovary, but we have more information about
testicular cancer
.
Causes
The cause of germ cell tumours is unknown. Research into possible causes is going on all the time.
Germ cells are a normal part of the ovary, but something causes them to change. This makes them grow too quickly and make a tumour.
Signs and symptoms
pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen)
a feeling of fullness or bloating in your tummy
needing to pee more often
irregular periods
Remember – these symptoms happen for lots of reasons other than cancer. But if you have any of them it’s important to speak to your GP.
If you’re worried about ovarian cancer
If you think you might have some of these symptoms, go and see your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think they could be because of cancer, they can do some
tests
to find out more.

Having tests for ovarian cancer
There are some tests that you might have at your doctor’s or at the hospital, to help them see if you have ovarian cancer.
Visiting your GP
If you think you might have any
symptoms of ovarian cancer
, you should speak to your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think these could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.
Tests
These might include:
a
blood test
an
ultrasound
of the ovaries
an internal examination, to check the organs in your pelvis
For an internal examination, you lie on your back with your feet together and your knees apart. The doctor will gently put 1 or 2 fingers inside your vagina and press a little on your lower tummy. It shouldn’t be painful but it can feel uncomfortable.
This test might make you feel embarrassed, but doctors are used to doing this investigation and it’s over quickly. If a male doctor examines you, there will usually be a female nurse present, but if not you can ask for one. You can have someone you feel close to with you during the examination, or if you prefer you can ask whoever is with you to go out until it’s over. You can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.
After these tests, your GP may arrange for you to see a doctor at the hospital who specialises in problems of the reproductive system (a gynaecologist).
At the hospital
The specialist will carry out an internal examination to check if there’s anything unusual in the shape and position of your ovaries and womb. Your GP may have already done an internal examination.
More tests
The specialist will arrange for you to have some more tests. Different tests are used to diagnose germ cell tumours of the ovary.
Blood tests
check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers. Some germ cell tumours produce high levels of these.
Ultrasound scans
use sound waves to build up a picture of your ovaries and the area around them on a computer screen. The person doing the scan will rub some gel on your tummy and gently move a small device over your tummy to produce the picture. You may also have an ultrasound scan done through the vagina (transvaginal ultrasound), to get a clearer picture. A small probe about the size of a tampon is gently put inside your vagina. It’s not painful but it can be a bit uncomfortable. You can have someone with you during the test if you want to.
CT scans
take a series of X-rays, which build up a 3D picture of the area of the body being scanned. It can show up the size and position of a tumour.
Laparoscopy is a test that’s sometimes done to look inside your tummy at your ovaries. It’s done under a general anaesthetic. You can usually go home the same day. The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in the skin in your lower tummy (just above the bikini line). Then they put a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end (called a laparoscope) through one of the cuts to look at the ovaries. Sometimes the surgeon will remove the ovary at the same time as the laparoscopy but they will discuss this with you before you have the surgery. The removed ovary will be looked at under a microscope to find out exactly what type of tumour it is.
Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.

Treatment for germ cell tumours of the ovary
Most girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary.
Your treatment will depend on the type of germ cell tumour you have and whether it has spread outside the ovaries. Treatment is usually a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, although you may only need surgery.
Before you have treatment, your specialist needs to know the type of germ cell tumour you have and what stage it is. The stage of a cancer describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread outside the ovary to any other parts of your body.
Your specialist will tell you the exact stage of the cancer after the operation to remove your ovary. Most germ cell tumours are diagnosed early when they’re in one or sometimes both ovaries but haven’t spread anywhere else in the body. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.
Another important part of ovarian cancer treatment is to try to make sure it doesn’t make you infertile (unable to get pregnant). Your doctors will think very carefully about this when planning your treatment.
Surgery
You may have an
operation
to remove the affected ovary and the fallopian tube. If it’s a very early germ cell tumour this might be the only treatment you need. After your operation you’ll come back to the clinic for regular checks. If there are any signs of the cancer coming back, it’s treated straight away.
Having the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won’t stop you from having a baby in the future. You can still get pregnant with only 1 ovary.
Before surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic. During the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. The ovary is removed through this cut. The operation is called a laparotomy.
If the cancer has spread, the surgeon may still do an operation to try to remove as much of the tumour as they can. If possible they will try to leave the other ovary and the womb. You will have more treatment after your operation to treat any of the tumour that they could not remove.
Removing both ovaries and the womb is only done if there’s no other way of successfully treating the cancer. Unfortunately this means you will not be able to get pregnant in the future. This can be very upsetting news. You may not have thought about having children yet, so it may be difficult to take in. If this happens there will be lots of support to help you.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is given after your operation to:
get rid of any cancer cells that weren’t removed with surgery
stop the cancer from coming back
Your specialist will explain more about this to you. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy and this treatment cures most girls. If it’s a very early germ cell tumour you might not even need chemotherapy.
Germ cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. When these are given together it’s called BEP for short.
Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment that usually take 3 weeks. You’ll have 3 to 4 cycles. You’ll spend the first 3 to 5 days of each cycle having your chemotherapy. You’ll usually stay in hospital for those days. You’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and then again the following week.
Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more.
Most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:
hair loss
tiredness
feeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine)
being more at risk of getting an infection
Doctors can’t be certain whether you’ll be able to get pregnant (fertility) in the future after you’ve had chemotherapy. They may talk to you about storing your eggs before chemotherapy starts. Stored eggs can be used with fertility treatments when you’re ready to try to get pregnant. Read more in Macmillan’s section on
fertility in young women
.
Surgery and chemotherapy
You’ll usually have chemotherapy after your surgery. You might have more surgery after you’ve finished chemotherapy if there’s still some tumour left behind.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Some types of germ cell tumour are sensitive to radiotherapy, but it is rarely used.

About obstructive sleep apnoea
Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea
Treating obstructive sleep apnoea
About obstructive sleep apnoea
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing.
This may lead to regularly interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions.
Apnoea and hypopnoea
There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA:
apnoea – where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it’s called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more
hypopnoea – a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more
People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases.
As many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS.
The term ‘obstructive’ distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending signals to the breathing muscles during sleep.
Symptoms of OSA
The symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep.
Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include:
loud snoring
noisy and laboured breathing
repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting
Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate.
During an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep – either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness – so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally.
These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired during the day. You’ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you think you might have OSA.
They can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre.
As someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed.
Read more about
diagnosing OSA
.
Causes of OSA
It’s normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn’t cause breathing problems.
In people with OSA the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including:
being overweight – excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make OSA worse
being male – it’s not known why OSA is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution
being 40 years of age or more – although OSA can occur at any age, it’s more common in people who are over 40
having a large neck – men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing OSA
taking medicines with a sedative effect – such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers
having an unusual inner neck structure – such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids or tongue, or a small lower jaw
alcohol – drinking alcohol, particularly before going to sleep, can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse
smoking – you’re more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke
the menopause (in women) – the changes in hormone levels during the
menopause
may cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual
having a family history of OSA – there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to OSA
nasal congestion – OSA occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be a result of the airways being narrowed
Treating OSA
OSA is a treatable condition, and there are a variety of treatment options that can reduce the symptoms.
Treatment options for OSA include:
lifestyle changes – such as losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side
using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device – these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask
wearing a mandibular advancement device (MAD) – this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep
Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure.
However, for most people surgery isn’t appropriate and may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven’t helped.
Read more about
treating OSA
.
Complications of OSA
The treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of OSA, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases.
If OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others.
Poorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of:
developing
high blood pressure (hypertension)
having a
stroke
or
heart attack
developing an irregular heartbeat – such as
atrial fibrillation
developing
type 2 diabetes
– although it’s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity
Research has shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident.
If you’re diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. It’s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.
Once a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn’t drive until your symptoms are well controlled.
The GOV.UK website has advice about
how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition
.
Preventing OSA
It’s not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes may reduce your risk of developing the condition.
These include:
losing weight
if you’re overweight or obese
limiting how much
alcohol
you drink and avoiding alcohol in the evening
stopping smoking
if you smoke
avoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisers
Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can usually be diagnosed after you’ve been observed sleeping at a sleep clinic, or by using a testing device worn overnight at home.
If you think you have OSA, it’s important to visit your GP in case you need to be referred to a sleep specialist for further tests and treatment.
Before seeing your GP it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to observe you while you’re asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot episodes of breathlessness.
It may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This asks how likely you’ll be to doze off in a number of different situations, such as watching TV or sitting in a meeting.
The final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.
For example, a score of 16-24 means you’re excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. A score of eight to nine is considered average during the daytime.
An online version of the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale
can be found on the British Lung Foundation website.
Seeing your GP
When you see your GP, they’ll usually ask a number of questions about your symptoms, such as whether you regularly fall asleep during the day against your will.
Your blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample probably sent off to help rule out other conditions that could explain your tiredness, such as an underactive thyroid gland (
hypothyroidism
).
The next step is to observe you while you’re asleep at a local sleep centre. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help treat people with sleep disorders.
The Sleep Apnoea Trust Association has a list of
NHS sleep clinics in Scotland
.
Observing your sleep
The sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.
This may include measuring your height and weight to work out your
body mass index (BMI)
, as well as measuring your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA.
The sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight, either by spending the night at the clinic or taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse.
Testing at home
In many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.
The equipment you are given may include:
a breathing sensor
sensors to monitor your heart rate
bands that are placed around your chest
oxygen sensors that are put on your finger
The equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate and snoring through the night.
If more information about sleep quality is required, a more detailed investigation called polysomnography will be required, which will be carried out at the sleep centre.
Testing at a sleep centre
The main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography.
During the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.
Bands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.
A number of different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including:
electroencephalography (EEG) – this monitors brain waves
electromyography (EMG) – this monitors muscle tone
recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen
recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose
pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels
electrocardiography (ECG) – this monitors your heart
Sound recording and video equipment may also be used.
If OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA.
Read about
treating OSA
for more information about CPAP.
Once the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend appropriate treatment.
Determining the severity of OSA
The severity of OSA is determined by how often your breathing is affected over the course of an hour. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI).
Severity is measured using the following criteria:
mild – an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour
moderate – an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour
severe – an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour
Current evidence suggests treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. However, some research has suggested treatment may also help some people with mild OSA.
Treating obstructive sleep apnoea
Treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may include making lifestyle changes and using breathing apparatus while you sleep.
OSA is a long-term condition and many cases require lifelong treatment.
Lifestyle changes
In most cases of OSA you’ll be advised to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as:
losing weight
if you’re overweight or obese
stopping smoking
if you smoke
limiting your alcohol consumption, particularly before going to bed – the NHS recommends not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it’s best to spread this evenly over three or more days
avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tablets
Losing weight, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and avoiding sedatives have all been shown to help improve the symptoms of OSA.
Although it’s less clear whether stopping smoking can improve the condition, you’ll probably be advised to stop for general health reasons.
Sleeping on your side, rather than on your back, may also help relieve the symptoms of OSA.
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
As well as the lifestyle changes mentioned above, people with moderate to severe OSA usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.
This is a small pump that delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask that either covers your nose or your nose and mouth. The compressed air prevents your throat closing.
CPAP can feel peculiar to start with and you may be tempted to stop using it. But people who persevere usually soon get used to it and their symptoms improve significantly.
CPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA.
As well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of complications of OSA, such as
high blood pressure
.
Possible side effects of using a CPAP device can include:
mask discomfort
nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation
difficulty breathing through your nose
headaches and ear pain
stomach pain and flatulence (wind)
Earlier versions of CPAP also often caused problems such as nasal dryness and a sore throat. However, modern versions tend to include humidifiers, a device that increases moisture, which helps reduce these side effects.
If CPAP causes you discomfort, inform your treatment staff as the device can be modified to make it more comfortable. For example, you can try using a CPAP machine that starts with a low air pressure and gradually builds up to a higher air pressure as you fall asleep.
Mandibular advancement device (MAD)
A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, similar to a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.
They’re not generally recommended for more severe OSA, although they may be an option if you’re unable to tolerate using a CPAP device.
An MAD is worn over your teeth when you’re asleep. It’s designed to hold your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.
Off-the-shelf MADs are available from specialist websites, but most experts don’t recommend them, as poor-fitting MADs can make symptoms worse.
It’s recommended you have an MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren’t always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.
An MAD may not be suitable treatment for you if you don’t have many – or any – teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, consult your dentist to ensure they won’t be stressed or damaged by an MAD.
Surgery for OSA
Surgery to treat OSA isn’t routinely recommended because evidence shows it’s not as effective as CPAP at controlling the symptoms of the condition. It also carries the risk of more serious complications.
Surgery is usually only considered as a last resort when all other treatment options have failed, and also if the condition is severely affecting your quality of life.
A range of surgical treatments have been used to treat OSA. These include:
tonsillectomy – where the tonsils are removed if they’re enlarged and blocking your airway when you sleep
adenoidectomy – where the adenoids, small lumps of tissue at the back of the throat above the tonsils, are removed if they’re enlarged and are blocking the airway during sleep
tracheostomy – where a tube is inserted directly into your neck to allow you to breathe freely, even if the airways in your upper throat are blocked
weight loss (bariatric) surgery – where the size of the stomach is reduced if you’re severely obese and this is making your sleep apnoea worse
Surgery to remove excess tissue in the throat to widen your airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) used to be a common surgical treatment for OSA, but it’s performed less often nowadays.
This is because more effective treatments are available, such as CPAP. This type of surgery can mean you’re unable to use a CPAP device properly in the future if you need to.
Soft palate implants
Soft palate implants make the soft palate, part of the roof of the mouth, stiffer and less likely to vibrate and cause an obstruction. The implants are inserted into the soft palate under
local anaesthetic
.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said soft palate implants are safe, but they’re not currently recommended for treating OSA as there’s a lack of evidence about their effectiveness.
However, this form of treatment is recommended for treating snoring associated with OSA in exceptional cases.
Support groups
OSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.
As well as causing physical problems such as tiredness and headaches, the condition can have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.
For support and advice about living with OSA, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as:

About oesophageal cancer
Oesophageal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the oesophagus (gullet) – the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.
It mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s and is more common in men than women.
Symptoms of oesophageal cancer
Oesophageal cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small. It’s only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop.
Symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:
difficulty swallowing
persistent
indigestion
or heartburn
bringing up food soon after eating
loss of appetite and weight loss
pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back
Read more about the
symptoms of oesophageal cancer
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP if you experience:
swallowing difficulties
heartburn on most days for three weeks or more
any other unusual or persistent symptoms
The symptoms can be caused by several conditions and in many cases won’t be caused by cancer – but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
If your GP thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist.
Read about
how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed
Causes of oesophageal cancer
The exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but the following things can increase your risk:
persistent
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
smoking
drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time
being overweight or obese
having an unhealthy diet that’s low in fruit and vegetables
Stopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, losing weight and having a healthy diet may help reduce your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.
Read more about the
causes of oesophageal cancer
Treatments for oesophageal cancer
If oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it may be possible to cure it with:
surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus
chemotherapy
, with or without
radiotherapy
(chemoradiation), to kill the cancerous cells and shrink the tumour
If oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at a later stage, a cure may not be achievable.
But in these cases, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used to help keep the cancer under control and relieve any symptoms you have.

Symptoms of oesophageal cancer
Oesophageal cancer doesn’t usually have any symptoms at first. But as the cancer grows, it can cause swallowing problems and other symptoms.
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty swallowing
is the most common symptom of oesophageal cancer.
The cancer can narrow the oesophagus, making it difficult for food to pass down. It may feel as though food is getting stuck and sometimes swallowing may be uncomfortable or painful.
You may have to chew your food more thoroughly, or you can only eat soft foods. If the tumour continues to grow, even liquids may become difficult to swallow.
Other symptoms
Other symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:
persistent
indigestion
or
heartburn
bringing up food soon after eating
loss of appetite and weight loss
persistent vomiting
pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back
a persistent
cough
hoarseness
tiredness,
shortness of breath
and pale skin
vomiting blood or coughing up blood – although this is uncommon
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP if you experience:
swallowing difficulties
heartburn on most days for three weeks or more
any other unusual or persistent symptoms
The symptoms can be caused by several conditions and in many cases won’t be caused by cancer – but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
Read about
how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed
Causes of oesophageal cancer
The exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase the risk of it developing.
GORD and Barrett’s oesophagus
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
is a condition in which a weakness in the muscles above the stomach means stomach acid can travel up into the oesophagus.
In around 1 in 10 people with GORD, repeated damage from stomach acid over many years can eventually cause changes in the cells lining the oesophagus. This is called Barrett’s oesophagus.
These abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in the future, although the risk is still small. It’s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop cancer within 10 to 20 years.
Alcohol
Drinking too much alcohol causes irritation and inflammation in the lining of the oesophagus.
If the cells in the lining of your gullet become inflamed, they’re more likely to become cancerous.
Read more about
alcohol and drinking
, including tips on cutting down
Smoking
Tobacco smoke contains many harmful toxins and chemicals. These substances irritate the cells that make up the lining of the oesophagus, which increases the likelihood that they will become cancerous.
The longer you smoke, the greater your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.
Read more about
getting help to stop smoking
Obesity
If you’re overweight or
obese
, your risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus is higher than people of a healthy weight. The more overweight you are, the higher the risk.
This may be partly because obese people are more at risk of developing GORD and Barrett’s oesophagus (see above).
Read more information and advice about
losing weight
Diet
Not eating enough fruit and vegetables may increase your risk of getting oesophageal cancer.
You should aim to eat at least 5 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables every day.
Read more about
having a healthy diet
Other medical conditions
Certain rare medical conditions can also increase your chances of developing cancer of the oesophagus, including:
achalasia – where the oesophagus loses the ability to move food along, causing vomiting and acid reflux
Paterson-Brown Kelly syndrome (also called Plummer Vinson syndrome) – a condition that can cause
iron deficiency anaemia
and small growths in the throat
tylosis – an inherited skin condition
Diagnosing oesophageal cancer
Speak to your GP if you experience
symptoms of oesophageal cancer
. They will carry out an initial assessment and decide whether you need to have any further tests.
Seeing your GP
Your GP may:
ask about the symptoms you’re experiencing
carry out a physical examination
take a look at your medical history
If your GP thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist. This will usually be a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions affecting the digestive system).
Tests to diagnose oesophageal cancer
The 2 main tests used to diagnose oesophageal cancer are:
an endoscopy – this is the most common test
a barium swallow or barium meal
Endoscopy
An endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to see inside your oesophagus so they can check for cancer.
A thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end (an endoscope) is passed into your mouth and down towards your stomach.
Small samples of tissue are also removed from your oesophagus so they can be checked for cancer under a microscope. This is called a
biopsy
.
You’ll be awake while an endoscopy is carried out. It shouldn’t be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable.
You’ll normally be given
local anaesthetic
to numb your throat and possibly a sedative to help you relax.
Barium swallow or barium meal
A barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before several
X-rays
are taken.
The barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the X-ray. This can show whether there’s anything blocking your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer.
This test isn’t used to diagnose oesophageal cancer very often nowadays because the best way to confirm a diagnosis is to use tissue samples taken during an endoscopy.
Further tests
If you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will be recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread – known as called the ‘stage’.
These tests may include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where a series of X-rays are taken and put together by a computer to create a detailed picture of the inside of your body
an endoscopic
ultrasound scan
– where a small probe that produces sound waves is passed down your throat to create an image of your oesophagus and the surrounding area
a
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
– a scan that can help show how far the cancer has spread
a laparoscopy – a type of keyhole surgery performed under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep), in which a thin tube with a camera at the end is inserted through a cut in your skin to examine the area around your oesophagus
Stages of oesophageal cancer
The most widely used system for staging oesophageal cancer is the TNM system. This involves scoring the cancer in 3 categories:
T (tumour) – the location and size of the tumour
N (node) – whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body)
M (metastasis) – whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones
Scores for each category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer).
Knowing the stage of your cancer will help your care team work out the best treatment for you.

Treating oesophageal cancer
The main treatments for oesophageal cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Your treatment plan
You’ll be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals and your team will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, although final treatment decisions will be yours.
Your plan will largely depend on how far your cancer has spread – known as the ‘stage’.
stage 1 to 3 oesophageal cancer is usually treated with surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus (oesophagectomy) – chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy may be given before surgery to make it more effective or is sometimes used instead of surgery
stage 4 oesophageal cancer has usually spread too far for a cure to be possible, but chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other treatments can slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms
Surgery
There are 3 main types of surgery for oesophageal cancer.
Oesophagectomy
An oesophagectomy is the main treatment for early-stage oesophageal cancer.
During the procedure, your surgeon will remove the section of your oesophagus that contains the tumour and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes. A small portion of your stomach may also need to be removed.
The remaining section of your oesophagus is then reconnected to your stomach.
To access your oesophagus, your surgeon will either make incisions (cuts) in your tummy and chest, or in your tummy and neck.
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
A procedure called
endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) may sometimes be an option instead of an oesophagectomy if oesophageal cancer is diagnosed very early on.
It involves cutting out the tumour using a loop of wire at the end of a thin flexible tube (endoscope). The endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin.
Sometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or RFA).
Stents
For more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties, a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended.
The stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
involves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying.
It may be used:
before and sometimes after surgery, either with or without radiotherapy – to shrink the cancer and reduce the risk of it coming back
instead of surgery – in combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation)
to relieve your symptoms if curative treatment isn’t possible
The medicines can be given into a vein or taken as tablets. You’ll usually have the treatment every 3 weeks over a period of 6 to 18 weeks.
Side effects
Common side effects of chemotherapy include:
feeling sick
loss of appetite
losing weight
diarrhoea
feeling very tired
increased risk of infections
bleeding and bruising easily
These side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.

side effects of chemotherapy
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
involves using radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours.
It may be used:
in combination with chemotherapy before surgery – to shrink the cancer and reduce the risk of it coming back
instead of surgery – usually in combination with chemotherapy (called chemoradiation)
to relieve your symptoms if curative treatment isn’t possible
Radiotherapy is most often given using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at your oesophagus, or sometimes by temporarily placing a small piece of radioactive material in your oesophagus (brachytherapy).
Side effects
Common side effects of radiotherapy include:
tiredness
temporary soreness when swallowing
temporary worsening of swallowing difficulties
a dry throat
feeling or being sick
reddening of the skin and loss of body hair in the treatment area
These side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.

Living with oesophageal cancer
Having oesophageal cancer can have a big impact on your life, but support is available to help you cope.
Eating and swallowing
You may have swallowing difficulties during and after treatment for oesophageal cancer.
There are treatments that can help – including surgery to place a hollow tube (stent) in your oesophagus, or a combination of
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
– although they may not work immediately.
You might need to have a temporary feeding tube placed or fluids given through a drip inserted in a vein to begin with, before moving onto fluids by mouth and soft foods. You may eventually be able to eat solid food.
A speech and language therapist can assess your ability to swallow and suggest ways to overcome any problems. A dietitian can also help with any changes you need to make to your diet.

Support and advice
Coping with a diagnosis of cancer can be very difficult. You may find it helpful to:
talk to your friends and family – be open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put you and them at ease
communicate with others in the same situation – you may want to contact a local support group or join a forum such as the
HealthUnlocked forum for oesophageal patients
or
Cancer Chat
find out more about your condition – check websites such as
Cancer Research UK
or
Macmillan
, or speak to your care team or GP if you have any questions about your condition
take time out for yourself – don’t feel shy about telling friends and family if you want some time to yourself

Work
Having oesophageal cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, although you may need quite a lot of time off. During treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before.
If you have cancer, you’re covered by the
Disability Discrimination Act
. This means that your employer isn’t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness.
They have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope, such as:
allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments
allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment
You should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you’ll need off and when. Speak to a member of your human resources department, if you have one.
If you’re having difficulties with your employer you may be able to get help from your union, association representative or local
Citizens Advice Bureau
.

Macmillan:
work and cancer
Money and benefits
If you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. You may be entitled to financial support:
if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer
if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income
It’s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.

Palliative care
If you’re told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your oesophageal cancer or you decide to decline treatment, your GP or care team will provide you with support and pain relief. This is called palliative care.
You can choose to receive palliative care:
at home
in a care home
in hospital
in a hospice
Your doctor or care team should work with you to establish a clear plan based on your wishes.

Caring for someone with cancer
Being a carer isn’t easy. It can be emotionally and physically draining, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing.
But putting yourself last doesn’t work in the long-term. If you’re caring for someone else, it’s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible.
It’s in your best interests, as well as those of the person you are caring for.

About obesity
The term ‘obese’ describes a person who’s very overweight, with a lot of body fat.
It’s a common problem in the UK that’s estimated to affect around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11.
Defining obesity
There are many ways in which a person’s health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI).
BMI is a measure of whether you’re a healthy weight for your height. You can use the
BMI healthy weight chart
to work out your score.
For most adults, a BMI of:
18.5 to 24.9 means you’re a healthy weight
25 to 29.9 means you’re overweight
30 to 39.9 means you’re obese
40 or above means you’re severely obese
BMI isn’t used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high BMI without excess fat. But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they’re a healthy weight, overweight or obese.
A better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a BMI of 30 to 34.9).
Generally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.

diagnosing obesity
Risks of obesity
It’s very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing obvious physical changes, it can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:
type 2 diabetes
coronary heart disease
some types of cancer, such as
breast cancer
and
bowel cancer
stroke
Obesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as
depression
and low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).
Causes of obesity
Obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity. The excess energy is stored by the body as fat.
Obesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars.
There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
, although these type of conditions don’t usually cause weight problems if they’re effectively controlled with medication.
Read more about the
causes of obesity
Treating obesity
The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and
exercise regularly
. To do this you should:
eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)
join a local weight loss group
take up activities such as fast
walking
, jogging,
swimming
or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week
eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat
You may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.
If lifestyle changes alone don’t help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.
In rare cases, weight loss surgery may be recommended.

how obesity is treated
Other obesity-related problems
Obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.
Day-to-day problems related to obesity include:
breathlessness
increased sweating
snoring
difficulty doing physical activity
often feeling very tired
joint and back pain
low confidence and self-esteem
feeling isolated
The psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.
Serious health conditions
Being obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including:
type 2 diabetes – a condition that causes a person’s blood sugar level to become too high
high blood pressure
high cholesterol
and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke
asthma
metabolic syndrome – a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity
several types of
cancer
, including bowel cancer, breast cancer and
womb cancer
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
– where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet)
gallstones
– small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder
reduced fertility
osteoarthritis
– a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints
sleep apnoea
– a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease
liver disease
and
kidney disease
pregnancy complications, such as
gestational diabetes
or pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy)
Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is. It’s estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least 1 in every 13 deaths in Europe.
Outlook
There’s no “quick fix” for obesity. Weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. The healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.
Regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight can also help.
Remember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.
Causes of obesity
Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little.
If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don’t burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.
Calories
The energy value of food is measured in units called calories. The average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day.
This amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. For example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories – and that’s just one meal.
Another problem is that many people aren’t physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat.
Poor diet
Obesity doesn’t happen overnight. It develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as:
eating large amounts of processed or fast food – that’s high in fat and sugar
drinking too much
alcohol
– alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight
eating out a lot – you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar
eating larger portions than you need – you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions
drinking too many sugary drinks – including soft drinks and fruit juice
comfort eating – if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel better
Unhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. You may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you’re young and continue them into adulthood.
Read more about
eating well
Lack of physical activity
Lack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. They also rely on their cars, rather than
walking
or
cycling
.
For relaxation, many people tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely take
regular exercise
.
If you’re not active enough, you don’t use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat.
The Department of Health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. This doesn’t need to be done all in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. For example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week.
If you’re obese and trying to
lose weight
, you may need to do more exercise than this. It may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week.
Read more about the
physical activity guidelines for adults
Genetics
Some people claim there’s no point trying to lose weight because “it runs in my family” or “it’s in my genes”.
While there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, there’s no reason why most people can’t lose weight.
It may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents – such as having a large appetite – may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn’t make it impossible.
In many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood.
Medical reasons
In some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. These include:
an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
– where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones
Cushing’s syndrome – a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormones
However, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss.
Certain medicines, including some
corticosteroids
, medications for
epilepsy
and
diabetes
, and some medications used to treat mental illness – including
antidepressants
and medicines for
schizophrenia
– can contribute to weight gain.
Weight gain can sometimes be a side effect of
stopping smoking
Diagnosing obesity
Body mass index (BMI) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height.
For most adults, having a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re considered to be a healthy weight. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.
While BMI is a useful measurement for most people, it’s not accurate for everyone.
For example, the normal BMI scores may not be accurate if you’re very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in a high BMI when you’re not an unhealthy weight. In such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below).
What’s considered a healthy BMI is also influenced by your ethnic background. The scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white Caucasian background. If you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower.
BMI shouldn’t be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because their bodies are still developing. Speak to your GP if you want to find out whether your child is overweight.
Visiting your GP
If you’re overweight or obese, visit your GP for advice about
losing weight safely
and to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems.
Your GP may ask about:
your lifestyle – particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they’ll also ask you whether you smoke and how much alcohol you drink
any possible underlying causes for your obesity – for example, if you’re taking medication or have a medical condition that may contribute to weight gain
how you feel about being overweight – for example, if it makes you feel depressed
how motivated you are to lose weight
your family history – as obesity and other health conditions, such as
diabetes
, are often more common in families
As well as calculating your BMI, your GP may also carry out tests to determine whether you’re at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight.
These could include measuring your:
blood pressure
glucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample
waist circumference (the distance around your waist)
People with very large waists – generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women – are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.
Your GP may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. For example, some people of Asian, African or Afro-Caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk of
high blood pressure (hypertension)
. Healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds.
After your assessment, you’ll be offered an appointment to discuss the results in more detail, ask any questions that you have, and fully explore the treatment options available to you.
Treating obesity
If you’re obese, speak to your GP for advice about losing weight safely.
Your GP can advise you about losing weight safely by eating a
healthy, balanced diet
and regular
physical activity
.
They can also let you know about other useful services, such as:
local weight loss groups – these could be provided by your local authority, the NHS, or commercial services you may have to pay for
exercise on prescription – where you’re referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainer
If you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
high blood pressure
,
diabetes
or
obstructive sleep apnoea
, your GP may recommend further tests or specific treatment. In some cases, they may refer you to a specialist.

how your GP can help you lose weight
Diet
There’s no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg (1lb to 2lbs) a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day.
For most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day.
The best way to achieve this is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices.
A healthy diet should consist of:
plenty of fruit and vegetables
plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties)
some milk and dairy foods
some meat, fish, aggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein
just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in fat and suagr
Try to avoid foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous for people who are already obese.
You’ll also need to check calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don’t go over your daily limit.
Some restaurants, cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn’t compulsory. Be careful when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or Chinese dishes.
Diet programmes and fad diets
Avoid fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. These types of diets don’t work, can make you feel ill, and aren’t sustainable because they don’t teach you long-term healthy eating habits.
This isn’t to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. Many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people.
A responsible diet programme should:
educate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes and healthy eating
not be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat
be based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to last
Very low calorie diets
A very low calorie diet (VLCD) is where you consume less than 800 calories a day.
These diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but they aren’t a suitable or safe method for everyone, and they aren’t routinely recommended for managing obesity.
VLCDs are usually only recommended if you have an obesity-related complication that would benefit from rapid weight loss.
VLCDs shouldn’t usually be followed for longer than 12 weeks at a time, and they should only be used under the supervision of a suitably qualified healthcare professional.
Speak to your GP first if you’re considering this type of diet.
Exercise
Reducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy.
As well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. For example, it can help prevent and manage more than 20 conditions, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40%.
The Chief Medical Officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week – for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. Something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial.
Moderate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as:
brisk
walking
cycling
recreational
swimming
dancing
Alternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.
During vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. Examples include:
running
most competitive sports
circuit training
You should also do strength and balance training two days a week. This could be in the form of a gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such as
tai chi
. It’s also critical that you break up sitting (sedentary) time by getting up and moving around.
Read more about
strength and balance exercises
.
Your GP, weight loss adviser or staff at your local sports centre can help you create a plan suited to your own personal needs and circumstances, with achievable and motivating goals. Start small and build up gradually.
It’s also important to find activities you enjoy and want to keep doing. Activities with a social element or exercising with friends or family can help keep you motivated. Make a start today – it’s never too late.
Read more about the
physical activity guidelines for adults
and the
physical activity guidelines for older adults
.
Other useful strategies
Evidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. This could include things like:
setting realistic weight loss goals – if you’re obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications
eating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you’re eating – for example, not being distracted by watching TV
avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat
involving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts –they can help to motivate you
monitoring your progress – for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diary
Getting psychological support from a trained healthcare professional may also help you change the way you think about food and eating. Techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be useful.
Avoiding weight regain
It’s important to remember that as you lose weight your body needs less food (calories), so after a few months, weight loss slows and levels off, even if you continue to follow a diet.
If you go back to your previous calorie intake once you’ve lost weight, it’s very likely you’ll put the weight back on. Increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes a day and continuing to watch what you eat may help you keep the weight off.
Medication
Many different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat.
You can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it’s the right medicine for you. In most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. Only one product (Alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist.
Orlistat works by preventing around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. The undigested fat isn’t absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). This will help you avoid gaining weight, but won’t necessarily cause you to lose weight.
A balanced diet and exercise programme should be started before beginning treatment with orlistat, and you should continue this programme during treatment and after you stop taking orlistat.
When orlistat should be used
Orlistat will usually only be recommended if you’ve made a significant effort to lose weight through diet, exercise or changing your lifestyle.
Even then, orlistat is only prescribed if you have a:
body mass index (BMI) of 28 or more, and other weight-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes
BMI of 30 or more
Before prescribing orlistat, your doctor will discuss the benefits and potential limitations with you, including any potential side effects (see below).
Treatment with orlistat must be combined with a balanced low-fat diet and other weight loss strategies, such as doing more exercise. It’s important that the diet is nutritionally balanced over three main meals.
If you’re prescribed orlistat, you’ll also be offered advice and support about diet, exercise and making lifestyle changes.
Orlistat isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Dosage and duration of treatment
One orlistat capsule is taken with water immediately before, during or up to one hour after, each main meal (up to a maximum of three capsules a day).
If you miss a meal, or the meal doesn’t contain any fat, you shouldn’t need to take the orlistat capsule. Your doctor should explain this to you, or you can check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.
Treatment with orlistat should only continue beyond three months if you’ve lost 5% of your body weight. It usually starts to affect how you digest fat within one to two days.
If you haven’t lost weight after taking orlistat for three months, it’s unlikely to be an effective treatment for you. Consult your doctor or pharmacist, as it may be necessary to stop your treatment.
Taking orlistat with other health conditions
See your GP before starting treatment with orlistat if you have another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease, which you’re taking medication for. It may be necessary to change the dose of your medicine.
If you have type 2 diabetes, it may take you longer to lose weight using orlistat, so your target weight loss after three months may therefore be slightly lower.
If orlistat has helped you lose weight after three months, your prescription may be continued for up to a year. After that, your GP will carry out a review and decide whether you should continue taking it.
Side effects
Common side effects of orlistat include:
fatty or oily stools
needing the toilet urgently
passing stools more frequently
an oily discharge from your rectum (you may have oily spots on your underwear)
flatulence (wind)
stomach pain
headaches
upper respiratory tract infections, such as a
cold
These side effects are much less likely to occur if you stick to a low-fat diet.
Women taking the
oral contraceptive pill
should use an additional method of
contraception
, such as a
condom
, if they experience severe
diarrhoea
while taking orlistat. This is because the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed by your body if you have diarrhoea, so it may not be effective.
Surgery
Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese.
Bariatric surgery is usually only available on the NHS to treat people with severe obesity who fulfil all of the following criteria:
they have a BMI of 40 or more, or between 35 and 40 and another serious health condition that could be improved with weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure
all appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried, but the person hasn’t achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss
the person is fit enough to have
anaesthesia
and surgery
the person has been receiving, or will receive, intensive management as part of their treatment
the person commits to the need for long-term follow-up
Bariatric surgery may also be considered as a possible treatment option for people with a BMI of 30 to 35 who have recently (in the last 10 years) been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
In rare cases, surgery may be recommended as the first treatment (instead of lifestyle treatments and medication) if a person’s BMI is 50 or above.
Treating obesity in children
Treating obesity in children usually involves improvements to diet and increasing physical activity using behaviour change strategies.
The amount of calories your child should eat each day will depend on their age and height. Your GP should be able to advise you about a recommended daily limit, and they may also be able to refer you to your local family healthy lifestyle programme.
Children over the age of five should ideally get at least one hour (60 minutes) of vigorous-intensity exercise a day, such as running or playing football or netball. Sedentary activities, such as watching television and playing computer games, should be restricted.
Read more about the
physical activity guidelines for children and young people
Referral to a specialist in treating childhood obesity may be recommended if your child develops an obesity-related complication, or there’s thought to be an underlying medical condition causing obesity.
The use of orlistat in children is only recommended in exceptional circumstances, such as if a child is severely obese and has an obesity-related complication.
Bariatric surgery isn’t generally recommended for children, but may be considered for young people in exceptional circumstances, and if they’ve achieved, or nearly achieved, physiological maturity."

About osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.
The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are:
wrist fractures
hip fractures
fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)
However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine.
Osteoporosis isn’t usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain.
Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body.
Who’s affected?
Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK.
More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis.
Causes of osteoporosis
Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.
Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the
menopause
(when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).
Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including:
long-term use of high-dose oral
corticosteroids
other medical conditions – such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems
a family history of osteoporosis – particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent
long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels
having a low
body mass index (BMI)
heavy drinking and smoking

Diagnosing osteoporosis
Risk assessment tools
If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such as
FRAX
or Q-Fracture.
These tools help to predict a person’s risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm.
DEXA scan
They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It’s a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned.
Your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who’s the same age and sex as you. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score.
Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of:
above -1 SD is normal
between -1 and -2.5 SD is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass
below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis
Osteopenia
You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis.
Your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below, depending on your results and your risk of fracture.
Treating osteoporosis
Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones.
The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your DEXA scan.
If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you.

Preventing osteoporosis
If you’re at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include:
taking
regular exercise
healthy eating
– including foods rich in
calcium
and
vitamin D
making lifestyle changes – such as
giving up smoking
and reducing your
alcohol
consumption

preventing osteoporosis
.
Living with osteoporosis
If you’re diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular
sight tests
and hearing tests.
To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using:
hot and cold treatments such as warm baths and cold packs
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain
relaxation techniques
Speak to your GP or nurse if you’re worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have.
You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition.

Causes of osteoporosis
Osteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile. Some people are more at risk than others.
Bones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. You gradually start losing bone density from around the age of 35.
This happens to everyone, but some people develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. This means they’re at greater risk of a fracture.
Risk groups
Osteoporosis can affect men and women. It’s more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people.
Women
Women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density.
The female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the
menopause
(when monthly periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. This can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.
Women are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have:
an early menopause (before the age of 45)
a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed
absent periods for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dieting
Men
In most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there’s a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy.
Men continue producing testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.
In around half of men, the exact cause of low testosterone levels is unknown, but known causes include:
the use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids
alcohol misuse
hypogonadism (a condition that causes abnormally low testosterone levels)
Risk factors
Many hormones in the body can affect the process of bone turnover. If you have a condition of the hormone-producing glands, you may have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.
Hormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include:
hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)
disorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing’s syndrome
reduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)
disorders of the pituitary gland
hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands)
Other risk factors
Other factors thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:
a family history of osteoporosis
a parental history of hip fracture
a
body mass index (BMI)
of 19 or less
long-term use of high-dose oral
corticosteroids
(widely used for conditions such as
arthritis
and
asthma
), which can affect bone strength
having an eating disorder, such as
anorexia
or
bulimia
heavy drinking and smoking
rheumatoid arthritis
malabsorption problems, as experienced in
coeliac disease
and
Crohn’s disease
some medications used to treat
breast cancer
and
prostate cancer
which affect hormone levels
long periods of inactivity, such as long-term bed rest

Treating osteoporosis
Treatment overview
Although a diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the results of your bone mineral density scan (DEXA or DXA scan), the decision about what treatment you need – if any – is also based on a number of other factors. These include your:
age
sex
risk of fracture
previous injury history
If you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis because you’ve had a fracture, you should still receive treatment to try to reduce your risk of further fractures.
You may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. However, you should ensure you’re maintaining sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D. To achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements.
NICE recommendations
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made some recommendations about who should be treated with medication for osteoporosis.
A number of factors are taken into consideration before deciding which medication to use. These include your:
age
bone mineral density (measured by your T score)
risk factors for fracture
NICE has summarised its guidance for two groups of people:
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who haven’t had a fracture (primary prevention)
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have had a fracture (secondary prevention)
You can read the NICE guidance by clicking on the links below.
NICE guidance:
Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women
NICE guidance:
Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women
Medication for osteoporosis
A number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. Your doctor will discuss the treatments available and make sure the medicines are right for you.
Bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture.
There are a number of different bisphosphonates, including
alendronate
etidronate
ibandronate
risedronate
zolendronic acid
They’re given as a tablet or injection.
You should always take bisphosphonates on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. Stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. You’ll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids.
Bisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them for five years or longer. You may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate.
The main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include:
irritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach)
swallowing problems (dysphagia)
stomach pain
Not everyone will experience these side effects.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare side effect that’s linked with the use of bisphosphonates, although most frequently with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonate treatment for
cancer
and not for osteoporosis.
In osteonecrosis, the cells in the jaw bone die, which can lead to problems with healing. If you have a history of dental problems, you may need a check-up before you start treatment with bisphosphonates. Speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.
Strontium ranelate
Strontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells that break down bone and the cells that create new bone (osteoblasts).
It can be used as an alternative treatment if bisphosphonates are unsuitable. Strontium ranelate is taken as a powder dissolved in water.
The main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea and
diarrhoea
. A few people have reported a rare severe allergic reaction to the treatment. If you develop a skin rash while taking strontium ralenate, stop taking it and speak to your doctor immediately.
Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
SERMs are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. They help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine.
Raloxifene is the only type of SERM that’s available for treating osteoporosis. It’s taken as a tablet every day.
Side effects associated with raloxifene include:
hot flushes
leg cramps
a potential increased risk of
blood clots
Parathyroid hormone (teriparatide)
Parathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body. It regulates the amount of calcium in bone.
Parathyroid hormone treatments (human recombinant parathyroid hormone or teriparatide) are used to stimulate cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). They’re given by injection.
While other medication can only slow down the rate of bone thinning, parathyroid hormone can increase bone density. However, it’s only used in a small number of people whose bone density is very low and when other treatments aren’t working.
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of the treatment. Parathyroid hormone treatments should only be prescribed by a specialist.
Calcium and vitamin D supplements
Calcium is the major mineral found in bone, and having enough calcium as part of a
healthy, balanced diet
is important for maintaining healthy bones.
For most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day, which most people should be able to get from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium.
However, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. Ask your GP for advice about taking calcium supplements.
Vitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium. It’s difficult to get enough vitamin D from your diet alone because few foods contain vitamin D. In the UK, most healthy adults obtain vitamin D from exposing the skin to summer sunlight.
However, for people at risk of not getting enough vitamin D, supplementation with 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day (400 international units [IU]) is recommended to prevent deficiency.
At-risk groups include people over 65 years of age, and people who aren’t exposed to much sunlight because they cover their skin for cultural reasons, are housebound, or who stay indoors for long periods.
If you’re found to lack vitamin D, your GP may prescribe supplements at a higher dose than the above recommendation to correct the deficiency.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
HRT
is sometimes recommended for women who are experiencing the
menopause
, as it can help control symptoms.
HRT has also been shown to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture during treatment.
However, HRT isn’t specifically recommended for treating osteoporosis and it isn’t often used for this purpose.
This is because HRT slightly increases the risk of developing certain conditions, such as
breast cancer
,
endometrial cancer
,
ovarian cancer
,
stroke
and venous thromboembolism more than it lowers the risk of osteoporosis.
Discuss the benefits and risks of HRT with your GP.
Read more about the
risks of HRT
.
Testosterone treatment
In men, testosterone treatment can be useful when osteoporosis is caused by insufficient production of male sex hormones (hypogonadism).
Preventing osteoporosis
Your genes are responsible for determining your height and the strength of your skeleton, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise influence how healthy your bones are.
Regular exercise
Regular exercise is essential. Adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as
cycling
or fast
walking
, every week.
Weight-bearing exercise and resistance exercise are particularly important for improving bone density and helping to prevent osteoporosis.
As well as aerobic exercise, adults aged 19 to 64 should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week by working all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, arms and shoulders.
If you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it’s a good idea to talk to your GP or health specialist before starting a new exercise programme to make sure it’s right for you.
Read more about the
physical activity guidelines for adults
.
Weight-bearing exercises
Weight-bearing exercises are exercises where your feet and legs support your weight. High-impact weight-bearing exercises, such as
running
, skipping, dancing, aerobics, and even jumping up and down on the spot, are all useful ways to strengthen your muscles, ligaments and joints.
When exercising, wear footwear that provides your ankles and feet with adequate support, such as trainers or walking boots.
People over the age of 60 can also benefit from regular weight-bearing exercise. This can include brisk walking, keep-fit classes or a game of tennis.
Swimming
and cycling aren’t weight-bearing exercises, however.
Read more about
physical activity guidelines for older adults
.
Resistance exercises
Resistance exercises use muscle strength, where the action of the tendons pulling on the bones boosts bone strength. Examples include press-ups, weightlifting or using weight equipment at a gym.
If you’ve recently joined a gym or haven’t been for a while, your gym will probably offer you an induction. This involves being shown how to use the equipment and having exercise techniques recommended to you.
Always ask an instructor for help if you’re not sure how to use a piece of gym equipment or how to do a particular exercise.
Healthy eating
Eating a
healthy, balanced diet
is recommended for everyone. It can help prevent many serious health conditions, including
heart disease
,
diabetes
and many forms of
cancer
, as well as osteoporosis.
Calcium is important for maintaining strong bones. Adults need 700mg a day, which you should be able to get from your daily diet. Calcium-rich foods include:
leafy green vegetables
dried fruit
tofu
yoghurt
Vitamin D is also important for healthy bones and teeth because it helps your body absorb calcium. Vitamin D can be found in:
eggs
milk
oily fish
However, most vitamin D is made in the skin in response to sunlight. Short exposure to sunlight without wearing sunscreen (10 minutes twice a day) throughout the summer should provide you with enough vitamin D for the whole year.
Certain groups of people may be at risk of not getting enough vitamin D. These include:
people who are housebound or particularly frail
people with a poor diet
people who keep covered up in sunlight because they wear total sun block or adhere to a certain dress code
women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
If you’re at risk of not getting enough vitamin D through your diet or lifestyle, you can take a vitamin D supplement. For adults, 10 micrograms a day of vitamin D is recommended.
The recommended amount for children is 7 micrograms for babies under six months, and 8.5 micrograms for children aged six months to three years. Talk to your GP for more information.
Read more about
healthy eating
.
Other factors
Other lifestyle factors that can help prevent osteoporosis include:
quitting smoking
– smoking is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis
limiting your alcohol intake
– the NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; it’s also important to avoid
binge drinking

Living with osteoporosis
Getting support
Your GP or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about living with osteoporosis and can reassure you if you’re worried.
You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information about these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to others with osteoporosis, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.
Osteoporosis support
The
Royal Osteoporosis Society
provides a helpline service run by nurses with specialist knowledge of osteoporosis and bone health.
Call 0808 800 0035. You can also email them at
nurses@theros.org.uk
They can provide you with details of
local support groups
.
Recovering from a broken bone
Broken bones usually take six to eight weeks to recover. Having osteoporosis doesn’t affect how long this takes. Recovery depends on the type of fracture you have. Some fractures heal easily, while others may need more intervention.
If you have a complicated wrist fracture or hip fracture, you may need an operation to make sure the bone is set properly.
Hip replacements
are often needed after hip fractures, and some people may lose mobility as a result of weakened bones.
Osteoporosis can cause a loss of height due to fractures in the spinal column. This means the spine is no longer able to support your body’s weight and causes a hunched posture.
This can be painful when it occurs, but it may also lead to long-term (chronic) pain. Your GP or nurse may be able to help with this.
During the healing process, you may need the help of a physiotherapist or occupational therapist so you can make as full a recovery as possible.
Read more about
occupational therapy
.
Coping with pain
Everyone experiences pain differently, so what works for you may differ from what works for someone else.
There are different ways to manage pain, including:
medication
heat treatment, such as warm baths or hot packs
cold treatment, such as cold packs
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – this is thought to reduce pain by stimulating the nerves
simple
relaxation techniques
, massage or hypnosis
You can use more than one of these techniques at the same time to manage your pain – for example, you could combine medication, a heat pack and relaxation techniques.
Working and money
You should be able to continue working if you have osteoporosis. It’s very important that you remain physically active and have a fulfilled lifestyle.
This will help keep your bones healthy and stop you focusing too much on your potential health problems. However, if your work involves the risk of falling or breaking a bone, seek advice from your employer, GP and the
Royal Osteoporosis Society
about how to limit your risk of having an accident or injury that could lead to a bone break.
If you can’t continue working, you may be eligible for the
Personal Independence Payment
. People over 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a disability benefit called
Attendance Allowance
.
Help for carers
You may also be entitled to certain benefits if you care for someone with osteoporosis.

About overactive thyroids
Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.
Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:
nervousness and
anxiety
hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy
unexplained or unplanned weight loss
swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat
The severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.
Read more about the
symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland
What causes an overactive thyroid gland?
The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body’s growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.
In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body’s metabolism.
There are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves’ disease, in which the body’s immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.
Read more about the
causes of an overactive thyroid gland
Treatment
An overactive thyroid usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms.
The 3 most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:
thionamides – a group of medications, including carbimazole and methimazole, that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone
radioiodine treatment – a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health)
surgery – in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre
Beta-blockers may also sometimes be used to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn’t target the thyroid gland itself.
It’s common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. This is known as having an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
. However, an underactive thyroid is not usually serious and is easily treated.
Read more about the
treatment of an overactive thyroid gland
Complications
Around 1 in 20 people with Graves’ disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as:
double vision
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
tearing (excess production of tears)
This is known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist).
A rarer and more serious complication is a sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. A thyroid storm can be life-threatening, as it causes severe
dehydration
and heart problems.
Read more about the
complications of an overactive thyroid gland
Who is affected
Women are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men.
In most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood.
An overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and Asian people, and less frequently in African-Caribbean people.
Symptoms of an overactive thyroid
An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism
If you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:
hyperactivity
mood swings – such as
anxiety
, irritability and nervousness
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
feeling tired all the time (fatigue)
muscle weakness
needing to poo or pee more frequently
excess fats in your poo – which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea)
sensitivity to heat and
excess sweating
unexplained or unexpected weight loss – despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain)
very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether
infertility
loss of interest in sex
If you have
diabetes
, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.
Signs of hyperthyroidism
If you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs:
a swelling in your neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)
irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (
palpitations
)
trembling or shaking (tremor)
warm, moist skin
redness on the palms of your hands
loosening of your nails in their nail beds
hives (urticaria)
patchy hair loss (alopecia)
twitching in your face and limbs
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.
It might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.
Causes of an overactive thyroid
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine.
Overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions.
Graves’ disease
Graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves’ disease if you smoke.
Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system mistakes something in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it.
In Graves’ disease, it attacks the thyroid gland, which leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones.
It is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved.
If you have Graves’ disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy. You may find your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent.
For more information on Graves’ ophthalmopathy, read
complications of an overactive thyroid gland
.
Thyroid nodules
It is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign).
However, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic.
Toxic thyroid nodules account for about 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.
Iodine supplements
Iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine.
This is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism – sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.
Amiodarone
Amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an
irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)
. If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.
Amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.
Follicular thyroid cancer
In rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of
thyroid cancer
that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.
Diagnosing an overactive thyroid
See your GP if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).
A diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results of
blood tests
that assess how well your thyroid gland is working. These are known as thyroid function tests.
Thyroid function tests
Your GP will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of:
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones)
TSH is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
When the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of TSH. When thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH.
When the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to boost it.
If you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of TSH in your blood are consistently lower than normal. Low levels of TSH mean your thyroid gland is overactive and likely to be making excessive thyroid hormones. This is the first part of the thyroid function test.
Your GP will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. If you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones.
Subclinical overactive thyroid gland
In some cases, tests may show you have normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of TSH.
This is known a subclinical overactive thyroid gland. If you are diagnosed with subclinical overactive thyroid, you may not need treatment.
In most cases, the reduced level of TSH in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself.
However, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored.
Determining the underlying cause
If tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause.
An additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. This involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form.
A scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland.
If your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely the underlying cause is either Graves’ disease or thyroid nodules.
If the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to:
swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection
having too much iodine in your diet
in rare cases,
thyroid cancer
Treating an overactive thyroid
If you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your GP will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.
Thionamides
Thionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. They are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine.
As thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between 4 to 8 weeks).
Once the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication.
You may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control.
Around 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as:
itchy skin rash
joint pain
These side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication.
In rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection.
Symptoms of agranulocytosis include:
fever
gum pain, swelling and bleeding
sore throat
mouth ulcers
persistent
cough
shortness of breath
If you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, phone your GP immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. If this is not possible, phone
111
or your local out-of-hours service.
Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers,
such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity.
Your specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. However, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma.
Beta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including:
feeling sick
feeling tired all the time (fatigue)
cold hands and feet
trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares
Radioiodine treatment
Radioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. Radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce.
Radioiodine treatment is given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. The dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful.
Radioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes.
Women should avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months after having radioiodine treatment. Men should not father a child for at least 4 months after having radioiodine treatment.
Most people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. If a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage.
A short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.
Thionamides or radioiodine?
In some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. However, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment.
Both treatments have advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages of thionamides include:
they are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them
there is less risk of getting an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
as a result of treatment
Disadvantages of thionamides include:
treatment may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment
there is a higher risk of side effects
Advantages of radioiodine treatment include:
treatment is usually very successful
Disadvantages of radioiodine treatment include:
there is a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment
radioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (Graves’ ophthalmopathy)
women have to avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months, and men should not father a child for at least 4 months after treatment
You should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.
Surgery
Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. It is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid.
Your specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck.
Other reasons for surgery include:
a person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take thionamides
a person has a severe form of Graves’ ophthalmopathy
the symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamides
It is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means there will be no chance of a relapse.
However, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland – these will be the same medications used to
treat an underactive thyroid gland
.
Complications of an overactive thyroid
Several complications can occur with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), particularly if the condition is not treated.
Graves’ ophthalmopathy
If you have Graves’ disease, you may have problems with your eyes. This is known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy and is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the tissues of the eyes. It affects around 1 in 20 people with Graves’ disease.
Symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy include:
eyes feeling dry and gritty
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
excessive tearing
double vision
some loss of vision
a feeling of pressure behind the eyes
In more severe cases, your eyes can bulge prominently from your eye sockets.
If you do develop Graves’ ophthalmopathy, you will probably be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for treatment.
Treatment options include:
eyedrops to ease the symptoms
sunglasses to protect the eyes against bright lights
corticosteroids
to reduce inflammation
radiotherapy
surgery
Pregnancy and overactive thyroid
Some women are pregnant when they are first diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland. Becoming pregnant can lead to a relapse of symptoms, especially in someone with a history of Graves’ disease.
Pregnant women with an overactive thyroid are at an increased risk of developing complications during pregnancy and birth, such as
miscarriage
and
eclampsia
.
They are also more at risk of going into labour prematurely and having a baby with a low birthweight.
Pregnant women will need specialist treatment, so the condition should be managed using medications that don’t affect the baby. This is likely to be a medication called propylthiouracil.
Underactive thyroid
In many cases, treatment causes the thyroid gland to release levels of hormones that are too low. This is known as having an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
.
Sometimes this will only be a temporary side effect of treatment, but it can often be permanent.
Symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland include:
being sensitive to cold
weight gain
constipation
depression
tiredness
An underactive thyroid gland is treated using medications to help replicate the effects of the thyroid hormones.
Read more about the
treating an underactive thyroid gland
Thyroid storm
An undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a rare but serious reaction called a thyroid storm. It affects around 1 in 100 people with an overactive thyroid gland.
A thyroid storm is a severe and sudden flare-up of symptoms caused by the metabolism going into overdrive, often due to triggers such as:
infection
pregnancy
not taking your medication as directed
damage to the thyroid gland, such as a punch to the throat
Symptoms of a thyroid storm include:
a very rapid heartbeat (over 140 beats a minute)
fever (a temperature higher than 38C/100.4F)
dehydration
, with
diarrhoea
and
vomiting
jaundice – a yellow tinge to your skin and eyes
severe agitation and confusion
hallucinations – seeing or hearing things that are not real
psychosis
– being unable to tell the difference between reality and your imagination
excessive sweating
chest pain
muscle weakness
A thyroid storm is a medical emergency. If you think you or someone in your care is experiencing this complication, you need to phone 999 for an ambulance."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/otitis-externa/,"Outer ear infection (otitis externa)
Otitis externa is an infection that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and the eardrum.
Otitis externa is often called ‘swimmer’s ear’ because regularly getting water in your ear can make inflammation more likely.
Symptoms of otitis externa
Symptoms of otitis externa include:
ear pain
itching
and irritation in and around your ear canal
redness and swelling of your outer ear and ear canal
a feeling of pressure and fullness inside your ear
scaly skin in and around your ear canal, which may peel off
discharge from your ear, which can be either thin and watery or thick and pus-like
tenderness when you move your ear or jaw
swollen and sore glands
in your throat
some
hearing loss
Usually, only one ear is affected.
With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. Some cases can persist for several months or longer.
When to get medical advice
Pharmacists can give advice and treatment about outer ear infections.
Find your local pharmacy
Your pharmacist may advise you to speak to your GP practice if needed.
Diagnosing otitis externa
Your pharmacist or GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly put things into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.
If you have otitis externa often, and treatment doesn’t help, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help check what type of infection you have, if any, so the right medication can be prescribed.
What causes otitis externa?
Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by:
irritation
fungal infections
allergies
There are a things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including:
damaging the skin inside your ear – for example by scratching or picking your ear
regularly getting water in your ear – for example by swimming
Getting water in your ear can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.
Who is affected?
Otitis externa is quite common. It’s estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives.
The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.
People with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. These include:
eczema
dermatitis
Treatment for otitis externa
Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
To help your symptoms and help prevent complications, you should:
avoid getting your affected ear wet – wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing if you aren’t washing your hair can help
avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared
remove any discharge by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool – do not stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear
remove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings
use pain relief such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to relieve ear pain – these aren’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first and if you’re still unsure, check with your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist
if your condition is caused by a boil in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal faster
Ear drops
Your pharmacist or GP can prescribe ear drops that usually improve symptoms within a few days.
There are different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa. You usually use them several times a day for about a week.
Your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if your symptoms are severe, or treatment does not help.
How to prevent otitis externa
There are things you can do to reduce your chances of developing otitis externa.
Do
consider wearing a swimming cap or using ear plugs if you’re a regular swimmer – but make sure you insert ear plugs carefully and don’t use them if they irritate your ears
if
earwax build-up
is a problem, have it removed by a healthcare professional
keep your ears dry and clean
turn your head from side to side after getting out of water – this helps water drain from your ears
Don’t
do not insert cotton wool buds or other things into your ears (including your fingers) – this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal
do not swim in polluted water
You should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath."

About Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years.
The three main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are:
involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor)
slow movement
stiff and inflexible muscles
A person with Parkinson’s disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms, including:
depression
and
anxiety
balance problems – this may increase the chance of a
fall
loss of sense of smell anosmis
problems sleeping (
insomnia
)
memory problems
Read more about the
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease
Seeking medical advice
See your GP if you’re concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Your GP will ask about the problems you’re experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests.
Read more about
diagnosing Parkinson’s disease
Causes of Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.
Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.
Read more about the
causes of Parkinson’s disease
Who’s affected?
It’s thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson’s disease, which means there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition.
Most people with Parkinson’s start to develop symptoms when they’re over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms when they’re under 40.
Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson’s disease than women.
Treating Parkinson’s disease
Although there’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible.
These include:
supportive treatments – such as physiotherapy and
occupational therapy
medication
in some cases, brain surgery
You may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, as symptoms are usually mild. However, you may need regular appointments with your specialist so your condition can be monitored.
Read more about
treating Parkinson’s disease
Outlook
As the condition progresses, the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease can get worse and it can become increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities without assistance.
Many people respond well to treatment and only experience mild to moderate disability, whereas the minority may not respond as well and can, in time, become more severely disabled.
Parkinson’s disease doesn’t directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections.
However, with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson’s disease now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.

– written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives.
Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease
The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first.
There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Some of the more common symptoms are described below.
However, the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual. It’s unlikely that a person with Parkinson’s disease would experience all or most of these.
Main symptoms
The three main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease affect physical movement:
tremor – shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and resting
slowness of movement (bradykinesia) – where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps
muscle stiffness (rigidity) – stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (
dystonia
)
These main symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson’s disease.
Other symptoms
Parkinson’s disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms.
Physical symptoms
balance problems – these can make someone with the condition more likely to have a
fall
and injure themselves
loss of sense of smell (anosmia) – sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop
nerve pain – can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness
problems with urination – such as having to get up frequently during the night to urinate or unintentionally passing urine (
urinary incontinence
)
constipation
an inability to obtain or sustain an erection (
erectile dysfunction
) in men
difficulty becoming sexually aroused and achieving an orgasm (sexual dysfunction) in women
dizziness
, blurred vision or fainting when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing one – caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure
excessive sweating (
hyperhidrosis
)
swallowing difficulties (
dysphagia
) – this can lead to
malnutrition
and
dehydration
excessive production of saliva (drooling)
problems sleeping (
insomnia
) – this can result in excessive sleepiness during the day
Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms
depression
and
anxiety
mild cognitive impairment – slight memory problems and problems with activities that require planning and organisation
dementia
– a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems, personality changes, seeing things that aren’t there (visual hallucinations) and believing things that aren’t true (delusions)
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you’re concerned you may have symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your medical history to help them decide whether it’s necessary to refer you to a specialist for further tests.

Causes of Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra.
Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements.
If these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means the part of the brain controlling movement can’t work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal.
The loss of nerve cells is a slow process. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost.
What causes the loss of nerve cells?
It’s not known why the loss of nerve cells associated with Parkinson’s disease occurs, although research is ongoing to identify potential causes.
Currently, it’s believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition.
Genetics
A number of genetic factors have been shown to increase a person’s risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear.
Parkinson’s disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to a child by their parents. However, it’s rare for the disease to be inherited this way.
Environmental factors
Some researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person’s risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.
It’s been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition.
However, the evidence linking environmental factors to Parkinson’s disease is inconclusive.
Other causes of parkinsonism
“Parkinsonism” is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement.
Parkinson’s disease is the most common type of parkinsonism, but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified.
These include parkinsonism caused by:
medication (drug-induced parkinsonism) – where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped
other progressive brain conditions – such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration
cerebrovascular disease – where a series of small
strokes
cause several parts of the brain to die
You can read more about
parkinsonism
on the Parkinson’s UK website.
Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease
No tests can conclusively show that you have Parkinson’s disease. Your doctor will base a diagnosis on your symptoms, medical history and a detailed physical examination.
Your GP will talk to you about the problems you’re experiencing and may ask you to perform some simple mental or physical tasks, such as moving or walking around, to help with the diagnosis.
In the early stages, your GP may find it difficult to say whether you definitely have the condition because symptoms are usually mild.
Referral to a specialist
If your GP suspects Parkinson’s disease, you’ll be referred to a specialist. This will usually be:
a neurologist – a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system
a geriatrician – a specialist in problems affecting elderly people
If your GP thinks you may be in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, you should see a specialist within six weeks. If they think you may be in the later stages, you should see a specialist within two weeks.
The specialist will most likely ask you to perform a number of physical exercises so they can assess whether you have any problems with movement.
A diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is likely if you have at least two of the three following symptoms:
shaking or tremor in a part of your body that usually only occurs at rest
slowness of movement (bradykinesia)
muscle stiffness (rigidity)
If your symptoms improve after taking a medication called levodopa, it’s more likely you have Parkinson’s disease.
Special brain scans, such as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, may also be carried out in some cases to try to rule out other causes of your symptoms.
Receiving the diagnosis
Being told you have Parkinson’s disease can be emotionally distressing, and the news can often be difficult to take in.
This means it’s important that you have the support of your family and a care team who will be able to help you come to terms with the diagnosis.
You may find it useful to contact Parkinson’s UK, the Parkinson’s support and research charity.
They can be contacted by:

Treating Parkinson’s disease
There are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson’s disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis.
There are efforts underway to try to increase the availability of these supportive therapies for Parkinson’s patients on the NHS.
Your local authority may be able to advise and help you. Ask your local authority for a care and support needs assessment.
Physiotherapy
A physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise.
The physiotherapist aims to make moving easier, and improve your walking and flexibility. They also try to improve your fitness levels and ability to manage things for yourself.
Occupational therapy
An occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life – for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops.
They can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you. This will help you maintain your independence for as long as possible.

occupational therapy
Speech and language therapy
Many people with Parkinson’s disease have swallowing difficulties (
dysphagia
) and problems with their speech.
A speech and language therapist can often help you improve these problems by teaching speaking and swallowing exercises, or by providing assistive technology.
Diet advice
For some people with Parkinson’s disease, making dietary changes can help improve some symptoms.
These changes can include:
increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you’re drinking enough fluid to reduce
constipation
increasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with
low blood pressure
, such as
dizziness
when you stand up quickly
making changes to your diet to avoid unintentional weight loss
You may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you may benefit from changing your diet.
Medication
Medication can be used to improve the main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, such as shaking (tremors) and movement problems.
However, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different.
Three main types of medication are commonly used:
levodopa
dopamine agonists
monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors
Your specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change.
Read on to learn about the treatments you may be offered. You can also see a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for Parkinson’s disease, where you can compare your options.
Levodopa
Most people with Parkinson’s disease eventually need a medication called levodopa.
Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement.
Increasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems.
It is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa.
These medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain.
They also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include:
feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting
tiredness
dizziness
If you’re prescribed levodopa, the initial dose is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect.
At first, levodopa can cause a dramatic improvement in the symptoms.
However, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years – as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. This means the dose may need to be increased from time to time.
Long-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and “on-off” effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off).
Dopamine agonists
Dopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared with levodopa. They can often be given less frequently than levodopa.
They are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine).
Sometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used.
Possible side effects of dopamine agonists include:
nausea or vomiting
tiredness and sleepiness
dizziness
Dopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible.
For some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours, especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido.
Talk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems.
As the person themselves may not realise the problem, it’s key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity.
If you’re prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects.
The dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. If nausea becomes a problem, your GP may prescribe anti-sickness medication.
A potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep.
This generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable.
People are usually advised to avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs.
Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors
Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, including selegiline and rasagiline, are another alternative to levodopa for treating early Parkinson’s disease.
They block the effects of an enzyme or brain substance that breaks down dopamine (monoamine oxidase-B), increasing dopamine levels.
Both selegiline and rasagiline can improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, although their effects are small compared with levodopa. They can be used alongside levodopa or dopamine agonists.
MAO-B inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally cause side effects, including:
nausea
headache
abdominal pain
high blood pressure
Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson’s disease. They prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme COMT.
Side effects of COMT inhibitors include:
nausea or vomiting
diarrhoea
abdominal pain
Non-oral therapies
When Parkinson’s symptoms become difficult to control with tablets alone, a number of other treatments can be considered.
Apomorphine
A dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either by:
a single injection, when required
a continuous infusion using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bag
Duodopa
If you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used.
This medication comes as a gel that’s continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall.
There’s an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you.
About 25 specialist neuroscience centres in the UK offer this treatment. This treatment is only available if you have very severe on-off fluctuations or involuntary movements.
Surgery
Most people with Parkinson’s disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is used in some cases.
This surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the UK, but it’s not suitable for everyone.
If surgery is being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.
Deep brain stimulation
Deep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall.
This is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain.
A tiny electric current is produced by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by Parkinson’s disease.
Although surgery doesn’t cure Parkinson’s disease, it can ease the symptoms for some people.
Treating additional symptoms
As well as the main symptoms of movement problems, people with Parkinson’s disease can experience a wide range of additional symptoms that may need to be treated separately.
These include:
depression and anxiety – this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more about
treating depression
problems sleeping (insomnia) – this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more about

Clinical trials
Much progress has been made in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease as the result of clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.
All clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those in routine care.
If you are asked if you want to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet about the trial.
If you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.
Complementary and alternative therapies
Some people with Parkinson’s disease find complementary therapies help them feel better. Many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
However, there’s no clinical evidence they’re effective in controlling the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Most people think complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, some can be harmful and they shouldn’t be used instead of the medicines prescribed by your doctor.
Some types of herbal remedies, such as St John’s wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
If you’re considering using an alternative treatment along with your prescribed medicines, check with your care team first.
Living with Parkinson’s disease
It’s important to do what you can to stay physically and mentally healthy if you have Parkinson’s disease.
Exercise and healthy eating
Regular exercise is particularly important in helping relieve muscle stiffness, improving your mood, and relieving stress.
There are many activities you can do to help keep yourself fit, ranging from more active sports like tennis and
cycling
, to less strenuous activities such as
walking
, gardening and
yoga
.
You should also try to
eat a balanced diet
containing all the food groups to give your body the nutrition it needs to stay healthy.
Vaccinations
Everyone with a long-term condition is encouraged to get a yearly
flu jab
each autumn.
The
pneumococcal vaccination
is also usually recommended, which is a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.
Relationships and support
Being diagnosed with a long-term condition like Parkinson’s disease can put a strain on you, your family and friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they’re close to you.
Dealing with the deterioration of symptoms, such as increasing difficulty with movement, may make you feel frustrated and depressed. Spouses, partners or carers will inevitably feel anxious or frustrated as well.
Be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. Don’t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you want.
Support
If you have any questions about your condition, your GP or Parkinson’s disease specialist nurse may be able to help.
You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have details of these.
Some people find it helpful to talk to others with Parkinson’s disease, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.
Care and support services
It’s worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what would help you achieve the best quality of life.
For example, you may wish to consider equipment, help in your home, and home adaptations.
Parkinson’s UK
Parkinson’s UK
is the main Parkinson’s support and research charity in the UK.
They can offer the support and advice you may need if you’re living with Parkinson’s disease, and can let you know about support groups in your local area.
They can be contacted by:
free confidential helpline on 0808 800 0303 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm, and 10am to 2pm on Saturdays)
email:
hello@parkinsons.org.uk
The Parkinson’s UK website also features all the latest news, publications and research updates, as well as an
online community
where you can share your experiences of living with Parkinson’s.
Work and finances
Being diagnosed with Parkinson’s doesn’t mean you have to stop working. Many people with the condition keep working for years after their diagnosis.
You may find it hard to cope financially if you do have to stop work or work part-time because of your condition.
However, you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:
You are entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness.
You may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness.
You may be eligible for
Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
, which replaced the
Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
, if you’re aged 64 and under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties.
You may be able to get
Attendance Allowance
if you’re aged 65 or over.
You may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
if you’re caring for someone with Parkinson’s disease.
You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.
Driving
If you’ve been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and your insurance company.
You won’t necessarily have to stop driving. You’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition, as well as details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive.
Complex Parkinson’s disease and palliative care
Complex Parkinson’s disease is defined as the stage when treatment is unable to consistently control symptoms, or the person has developed uncontrollable jerky movements (disabling dyskinesia).
These problems can still be helped by adjustment or addition of some of the medications used to
treat Parkinson’s disease
, under the supervision of a doctor with a specialist interest in Parkinson’s disease.
As Parkinson’s disease progresses, you’ll be invited to discuss the care you want with your healthcare team as you near the end of your life. This is known as palliative care.
When there’s no cure for an illness, palliative care tries to alleviate symptoms, and is also aimed at making the end of a person’s life as comfortable as possible.
This is done by attempting to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms, while providing psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family.
Palliative care can be provided at home or in a hospice, residential home or hospital. You may want to consider talking to your family and care team in advance about where you’d like to be treated and what care you wish to receive."

Complications
Introduction
Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason.
Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It’s a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations.
However, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.
Anxiety
Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including
phobias
– an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal
generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) – a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations
post-traumatic stress disorder – a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events
Panic attacks
A panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.
You may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:
nausea
sweating
trembling
a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)
The number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week.
Read more about the
symptoms of panic disorder
.
Panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they’re not dangerous. An attack won’t cause you any physical harm, and it’s unlikely that you’ll be admitted to hospital if you’ve had a panic attack.
What causes panic disorder?
As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood.
However, it’s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.
Read about the possible
causes of panic disorder
.
It’s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example:
mitral valve prolapse
postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS)
anaemia
paroxysmal atrial tachycardia – episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly
thyrotoxicosis – where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat,
sweating
, tremor and anxiety
poorly controlled
diabetes
adrenal tumours – growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys)
carcinoid syndrome – a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones)
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (
hypoglycaemia
)
Diagnosing panic disorder
See your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above).
You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.
Read more about
how panic disorder is diagnosed
.
Treating panic disorder
The aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms.
Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.
Read more about
treating panic disorder
and
things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack
.
Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It’s your legal obligation to inform the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)
about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.
GOV.UK has further information and advice about
driving with a disability or health condition
.
Complications of panic disorder
Panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it’s important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage.
Left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other
phobias
.
Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong.
Read more about the
complications of panic disorder

Symptoms
The symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.
Symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.
As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other symptoms, including:
a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (
palpitations
)
sweating
trembling
hot flushes
chills
shortness of breath
a choking sensation
chest pain
nausea
dizziness
feeling faint
numbness or pins and needles
dry mouth
a need to go to the toilet
ringing in your ears
a feeling of dread or a fear of dying
a churning stomach
a tingling sensation in your fingers
shivering
shaking
The physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.
For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which creates a cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic.
Sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you’re having a
heart attack
.
However, it’s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won’t result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don’t cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this ‘heart attack sensation’ and become more aware of how to control their symptoms.
Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes. Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.
Recurrent panic attacks
People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.
People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.
If you have panic disorder, you may also feel anxious about when your next attack will be.
Depersonalisation
During a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you’re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.
This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.
Causes
As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood.
It’s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below.
Traumatic life experiences
A trauma, such as
bereavement
, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.
Genetics
Having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person’s risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn’t known.
Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It’s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.
Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide
Some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.
Catastrophic thinking
Another theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. This triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.
Diagnosis
Everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks.
However, not everyone who has panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.
Panic attacks
Some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space.
While most people with
phobias
only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason.
This means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.
Talk to your GP
Your GP will ask you to describe the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. They’ll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations.
It’s important to tell your GP about how you’ve been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you.
Although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life, try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.
Your GP needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.
Physical examination
Your GP may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
For example, an
overactive thyroid
gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack.
By ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis.
Treatment
The main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms.
Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.
Depending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two.
If you’re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn’t work, medication may be recommended.
Before starting any form of treatment, your GP will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects.
No single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. The treatment that’s recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.
It’s important you understand what your treatment will involve. If you don’t understand something your GP has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.
Cognitive behavioural therapy
Psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it’s recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
CBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist.
The therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you’re experiencing an attack.
Once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks.
For example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session.
NICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with ‘homework’ being set between sessions so that you can practice what you’ve learnt after each session.
You should visit your GP regularly while you’re having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you’re doing.
Support groups
Support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They’re also a good way of meeting other people who’ve had similar experiences of the condition.
Panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you.
Anxiety UK
and
Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK)
are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders.
Support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing.
Ask your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to
find anxiety services in your area
.
Antidepressants
Antidepressants
are often associated with
depression
, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.
Antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It’s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they’re not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating panic disorder.
When starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your GP at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. This will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your GP to assess which treatment is most effective. It will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.
They’re the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. They’re usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.
Common side effects of SSRIs include:
nausea
headaches
low sex drive (loss of libido)
blurred vision
diarrhoea
or
constipation
dizziness
dry mouth
loss of appetite
sweating
feeling agitated
insomnia
(sleep problems)
abdominal pain
When you first start taking SSRIs, your feelings of anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. In most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine.
Speak to your GP if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they’re not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days.
After you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you’re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it’s important that your progress is carefully monitored.
If your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular
blood tests
or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don’t show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect.
The length of time that you’ll have to take a SSRI for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. Even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it’s likely that you’ll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months.
If you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. Some people may have to take SSRIs for longer than the usual six to 12 month period.
When you and your GP decide that it’s appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs unless your GP specifically advises you to.
Stopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your GP, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as:
dizziness
numbness and tingling
nausea and vomiting
headache
anxiety
sleep disturbances
sweating
These symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. The symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly.
For some people, this means having to take SSRIs on a long-term basis. For others, a course of CBT can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring.
Contact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that don’t ease.
Tricyclic antidepressants
If SSRIs aren’t suitable, or if your symptoms don’t improve after a 12 week course of SSRIs, your GP may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant.
Tricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood.
Imipramine and clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren’t addictive.
SSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include:
constipation
difficulty urinating
blurred vision
dry mouth
weight gain or weight loss
drowsiness
sweating
lightheadedness
skin rash
The side effects should ease after seven to 10 days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don’t ease.
Pregabalin
Pregabalin is another medication that’s often used to treat panic disorder. It’s an anticonvulsant that’s also used to treat
epilepsy
(a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it’s also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.
Side effects of pregabalin can include:
drowsiness
dizziness
increased appetite and weight gain
blurred vision
headaches
dry mouth
vertigo
– the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning
Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs.
Clonazepam
Clonazepam is another medication that’s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder.
It can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.
Referral
You may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, CBT and medication don’t improve your
symptoms of panic disorder
.
A mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They’ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.
The specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. The type of mental health specialist that you’ll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. For example, you may be referred to a:
psychiatrist – a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication
clinical psychologist – who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacks
Things you can do to help yourself
There are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat the symptoms of panic disorder yourself.
Some of these techniques are listed below.
Stay where you are
If possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. The attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it’s safe to do so if you’re driving.
Focus
If you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass.
During an attack, try to focus on something that’s non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.
Slow deep breathing
While you’re having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. Feelings of panic and
anxiety
can get worse if you breathe too quickly. Try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.
Challenge your fear
When you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. You can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn’t real and that it will pass in a few minutes.
Creative visualisation
Many things can go through your mind during a panic attack – for example, some people think about disaster or death. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images.
Think of a place or a situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease. Once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. It should help distract you from the situation and may also help ease your symptoms.
Thinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you’ve got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. Creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others.
Don’t fight a panic attack
Fighting a panic attack can often make it worse. Trying to resist the attack and finding you’re unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic.
Instead, during a panic attack, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing, and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn’t life-threatening. Focus on the fact that the attack will evetually end and try your best to let it pass.
Relaxation
If you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. Learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur.
Some people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. Activities, such as
yoga and pilates
, can also be helpful. You can also practise breathing and relaxation techniques, which you can use during a panic attack to help ease your symptoms.
Exercise
Regular exercise
, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. It can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood.
It’s recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as
cycling
or fast
walking
, every week.
They should also do
muscle-strengthening activities
on two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).
Visit your GP for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven’t exercised before or for a long time.
Read more about the
physical activity guidelines for adults
.
Diet
Unstable blood sugar levels can contribute to the
symptoms of a panic attack
. Therefore, you should maintain a
healthy, balanced diet
, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. Also, avoid caffeine,
alcohol
and smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks.
Complications
Panic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it’s very important you seek medical help as soon as possible.
This is because treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage.
Left undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions.
Agoraphobia and other phobias
Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong.
If you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. Many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia.
Agoraphobia is one of the conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. People with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place.
You may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you’ll have difficulty getting help if you need it. You may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic attack.
If you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you’re not with a trusted family member or a friend.
If you have panic disorder, you may also develop other
fears and phobias
, which can often seem irrational. For example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things.
Children
Panic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children.
Panic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. Severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. The fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. They may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork.
Diagnosing panic disorder
in children is usually a case of taking a detailed medical history and carrying out a thorough physical examination to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.
Screening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what’s causing your child’s panic attacks.
Panic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation).
If your child displays the signs and symptoms of panic disorder over a prolonged period of time, your GP may refer them to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.
The specialist may recommend a course of
psychotherapy
for your child, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Drug and alcohol misuse
Some studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem.
The side effects or withdrawal symptoms of both prescribed medication and illegal drugs can increase the
symptoms of anxiety
.
Smoking and caffeine can also make your anxiety symptoms worse, so you should try to
give up smoking
(if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet."

About Paget’s disease of the nipple
Paget’s disease of the nipple, also known as Paget’s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer.
The term Paget’s disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget’s disease of the bone, which occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed.
A similar type of
skin cancer
can also occur in other parts of the body.
The rest of this section will use the term Paget’s disease to refer to Paget’s disease of the nipple or breast.
Symptoms of Paget’s disease
Paget’s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and produces
eczema-like symptoms
, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).
It can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to
psoriasis
.
Other possible symptoms include:
itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple
bleeding from the skin of the nipple
If you’re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn’t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be Paget’s disease but should still be checked by a doctor.
Causes of Paget’s disease
Paget’s disease is usually a sign of
breast cancer
in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple.
The breast cancer can either be:
invasive – where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue
non-invasive – where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread
In a small amount of cases, the only evidence of Paget’s disease is the nipple changes.
In about half of all cases of Paget’s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. The majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread.
Most people with Paget’s disease of the nipple who don’t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.
Diagnosing Paget’s disease
You should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple).
As Paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.
Speak to your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. While most
breast lumps
are not cancerous, it’s important you have it checked out.

Treating Paget’s disease
Paget’s disease is treated in the same way as breast cancer.
Surgery is usually the first line of treatment but unlike other forms of breast cancer, it involves removing breast tissue that includes the nipple and areola.
This may be followed by a combination of:
chemotherapy
– where powerful medication is used to destroy cancerous cells
radiotherapy
– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells
biological or hormone therapy – which can be used to treat certain types of cancer
If Paget’s disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there’s a good chance of recovery. Read more about
how Paget’s disease is treated.
Preventing Paget’s disease
Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of
cancer
, including breast cancer. However, these factors remain controversial.
Screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 47 years of age or over.

Risk factors for breast cancer
There are a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. These include:
age – your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you get older
family history – if you have a number of close relatives with breast cancer, your chances of also developing the condition are increased
previously being diagnosed with breast cancer
previously having a benign breast lump – certain types of benign lump may slightly increase your risk but this is only seen in a small number of women
being overweight – which is especially significant in post-menopausal women
alcohol – your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink
Information about you
If you have Paget’s disease of the nipple, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Diagnosing Paget’s disease of the nipple
As Paget’s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it’s very important you speak to your GP if you notice changes to the tissue or skin of your breast.
In particular, you should tell your GP if you notice any changes to:
the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple)
your breasts, particularly lumps in your breast
Paget’s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with
eczema
, a skin condition that also causes red, itchy and dry skin.
Therefore, you should visit your GP for a diagnosis rather than assuming you have eczema. Paget’s disease is a form of
breast cancer
and the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.
Your GP will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with one of them. They may also ask you:
about your symptoms and how long you have had them
whether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body
whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer
your age and whether you have experienced the
menopause
(when a woman’s monthly periods stop)
whether you’re taking any medication, including
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
, which is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause, or the
oral contraceptive pill
how much
alcohol
you drink
how much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight
If your GP thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests.
Breast clinic
When you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have, what type of breast cancer.
Staff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur.
Tests carried out at the clinic may include the following:
an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities
a mammogram (if you are 35 years of age or over)
an
ultrasound scan
– which is the first line of investigation used in younger women
a skin biopsy will be carried out if Paget’s disease is suspected
Mammogram
A mammogram is a simple procedure that uses
X-rays
to create an image of the inside of your breasts. It can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump.
Younger women often have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. Therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. If you’re under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead.
However after a diagnosis of Paget’s disease has been confirmed, mammography will become an important part of pre-surgery assessment.
During a mammogram, the radiographer will position 1 of your breasts on a flat X-ray plate. A second X-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the 2 plates.
An X-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.
Having a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. Your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer.
Breast ultrasound
If you are under 35 years of age, a breast
ultrasound
may be recommended. This is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.
Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. The image will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts.
Skin biopsy
A skin
biopsy
is used to diagnose Paget’s disease. A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous.
Further tests
There are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.
Treating Paget’s disease of the nipple
Paget’s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer.
It’s usually treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast – a procedure known as a mastectomy.
You can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.
Surgery
If you’re diagnosed with Paget’s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. There are 2 main types of surgery. They are:
mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast
breast-conserving surgery – surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast
These types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).
Mastectomy
A mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. You may need to have a mastectomy if:
the tumour is large or in the centre of your breast
there is more than one area of breast cancer
breast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable results
If lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. This is a long-term condition, but can be treated with:
massage
compression sleeves – tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your arm
Lymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. See your breast care nurse or GP if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation.
Breast-conserving surgery
Breast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue.
If you have Paget’s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. You should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery.
If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on:
the size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast
whether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breast
Your surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer.
If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast.
After having breast-conserving surgery, it’s likely you will need radiation treatment (
radiotherapy
) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.
Breast reconstruction
If you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. This can be done by:
inserting a breast implant
using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast
The reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. You should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision.
For example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.
Creating a nipple
A nipple can be created by:
having a nipple tattooed onto the skin
using your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time
using a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washing
Prostheses
If you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the NHS.
After having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years.
Further treatment
After your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast.
If you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need.
Other types of treatment for breast cancer include:
chemotherapy
– cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells
radiotherapy
– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually
X-rays
, are used to destroy cancer cells
biological therapy – if your breast cancer is HER2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells
hormone therapy – if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects
Preventing Paget’s disease of the nipple
A number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including Paget’s disease of the nipple.
Diet and lifestyle
Exercising regularly
and eating a
healthy, balanced diet
are known to help prevent many forms of cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as
heart disease
and
diabetes
.
Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain a
healthy weight
, do regular exercise and who have a low intake of
saturated fat
and
alcohol
.
It has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week) can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by up to a third.
If you have been through the
menopause
(when your monthly periods stop), it’s particularly important you are not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.
Breastfeeding
Studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t.
The reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.
Medication
In June 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t.
These medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots or
womb cancer
, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. Women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small.
A course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.
Raloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting.
Your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery.
Currently, these 2 medications are not licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.
Breast screening
Breast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. The procedure uses mammograms, where
X-rays
are taken, to create an image of the inside of your breasts.
The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 50 years of age or over. The NHS has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47 to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening.
NHS breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. This is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities.
Speak to your GP if you are below screening age, worried about changes in your breasts, or have a family history of breast cancer.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/penile-cancer/,"Penile cancer
Penile cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs on the skin of the penis or within the penis.
Over the last 30 years, the number of penile cancer cases has increased by more than 20%, possibly due to changes in sexual practices.
However, improvements in diagnosis, staging and treatment have led to a similar reduction in the number of deaths resulting from the condition.
Signs and symptoms
You should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including:
a growth or sore on the penis that doesn’t heal within 4 weeks
bleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin
a foul-smelling discharge
thickening of the skin of the penis or foreskin that makes it difficult to draw back the foreskin (phimosis)
a change in the colour of the skin of the penis or foreskin
a rash on the penis
If you experience these symptoms, it’s important that they’re checked by your GP as soon as possible. It’s unlikely they’ll be caused by cancer of the penis, but they need to be investigated.
Any delay in diagnosing penile cancer could reduce the chances of successful treatment.
Types of penile cancer
The penis is made up of many different types of tissue. The type of penile cancer you have will depend on the type of cell the cancer developed from.
The most common types of penile cancer include:
squamous cell penile cancer – which accounts for more than 90% of cases and starts in the cells that cover the surface of the penis
carcinoma in situ (CIS) – a particular type of squamous cell cancer where only the cells in the skin of the penis are affected and it hasn’t spread any deeper
adenocarcinoma – cancer that starts in the glandular cells of the penis that produce sweat
melanoma of the penis – where the cancer develops in the skin cells that give the skin its colour
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the different
types of penile cancer
.
What causes penile cancer?
The cause of penile cancer isn’t known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it.
Men who carry the human papilloma virus (HPV) have an increased risk of developing penile cancer, which is the virus that causes
genital warts
.
Age is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis. The condition rarely affects men and anyone with a penis under 40 years of age. It most commonly occurs in men and anyone with a penis aged over 60.
Smoking is the most significant lifestyle factor associated with penile cancer. Chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your risk of getting the condition.
Conditions that affect the penis, such as phimosis, which makes the foreskin difficult to retract, increase your chances of developing infections such as balanitis.
Repeated infections are linked to a higher risk of developing some types of penile cancer, because they can weaken your immune system.
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about the
risks and causes of penile cancer
.
Diagnosing penile cancer
Your GP will ask you about any symptoms you have and when they occur. They’ll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of penile cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected penile cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
If your GP suspects penile cancer, they may refer you to a specialist – usually a urologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary system and genitals).
The specialist will ask about your symptoms and check your medical history. They may also check for any physical signs of penile cancer.
A
blood test
may be carried out to check your general health and the number of blood cells.
To confirm a diagnosis of penile cancer, you may need to have a
biopsy
. A small tissue sample will be removed so it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells.
Treating penile cancer
Treatment for penile cancer will depend on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has spread.
For example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment will usually involve either using a chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin. You will usually have a skin graft after surgery.
The main treatments for penile cancer that isn’t at a very early stage are:
surgery
radiotherapy
chemotherapy
Surgery will involve removing the cancerous cells and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.
In most cases, any physical changes to your penis after an operation can be corrected with reconstructive surgery. Skin and muscle can be taken from elsewhere in the body to recreate a functioning penis.
However, with early diagnosis and modern surgical techniques, your surgeon will usually be able to preserve as much penile tissue as possible.
As part of most treatments for penile cancer, the lymph glands (small organs that are part of the immune system) in the groin will be assessed to determine if the cancer has spread.
The test that’s used, known as a sentinel node biopsy, is widely available in the UK. In some cases, the lymph glands may need to be surgically removed.
As with most types of cancer, the outlook for individual cases depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced at the time of diagnosis.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about
staging penile cancer
and the
types of treatment for cancer of the penis
.
You can also read about
penile cancer
on the male cancer website
Orchid
. They also have a helpline you can phone – 0203 465 5766 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5.30pm).
Prevention
It isn’t always possible to prevent penile cancer, but you can reduce your chances of getting it.
One of the main ways you can reduce your chances of developing penile cancer is to
give up smoking
(if you smoke).
It’s also important to maintain good penis hygiene to prevent the bacterial and viral infections that can increase the risk of penile cancer.
This is easier if you were circumcised as a child, but there are steps you can take if you haven’t been circumcised. Simple penis hygiene can include:
using
condoms
to help reduce the possibility of catching HPV
regularly washing your penis with warm water, including under the foreskin
There’s little evidence to suggest that being circumcised as an adult will reduce your chances of developing penile cancer. However, if you have sores that don’t heal, or if it’s becoming increasingly difficult to clean under your foreskin, seek advice from your GP about the possibility of circumcision."

About pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that’s part of the digestive system.
Around half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. It’s uncommon in people under 40 years of age.
Symptoms of pancreatic cancer
In the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn’t usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose.
It’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren’t usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you’re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.
The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:
pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten
unexpected weight loss
jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured
Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:
nausea and vomiting
bowel changes
fever and shivering
indigestion
blood clots
You may also develop symptoms of
diabetes
if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.
Endocrine pancreatic cancer
There are also a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.
Causes of pancreatic cancer
It’s not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified.
Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include:
age – it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age
smoking
– around 1 in 3 cases is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco
having a history of certain health conditions – such as
diabetes
,
chronic pancreatitis
(long-term inflammation of the pancreas),
stomach ulcer
and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection)
In about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person’s parents. Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.
Cancer Research UK
has more information on
risk factors and causes
on their website
Diagnosing pancreatic cancer
Your GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged.
They’ll also check your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice and may request a urine sample and
blood test
.
If your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either:
an
ultrasound scan
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
a positron emission tomography (PET) scan – where you’re given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image
Depending on the results of a scan, further tests may include:
an endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) endoscopy – a type of endoscopy which allows close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) – a type of endoscopy which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an
X-ray
and highlight any tumours
a laparoscopy – a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy (a thin, flexible microscope)
A
biopsy
, where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures.
NICE guidelines
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.

Treating pancreatic cancer
Cancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it’s often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is large, treating the cancer will be more difficult.
If you’ve been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it’s advanced. Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration.
The first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. If this isn’t possible, treatment will focus on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm to your body.
The 3 main treatments for pancreatic cancer are:
surgery
chemotherapy
radiotherapy
Some types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 types of treatment or a combination of all 3.
Read more about
treating pancreatic cancer
.
Recovering from surgery
Recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.
You’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.
After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away.
You’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.
After the tumour has been removed, you’ll probably have a six-month course of
chemotherapy
, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. But because cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely.
Treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.
Treating pancreatic cancer
Treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the type, location and stage of your cancer (how far it’s spread).
Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration when deciding on your treatment plan.
The first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.
If this isn’t possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm.
Sometimes it’s not possible to get rid of the cancer or slow it down, so treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.
Cancer of the pancreas is very difficult to treat. In its early stages, this type of cancer rarely causes symptoms, so it’s often not detected until it’s quite advanced. If the tumour is large or has spread, treating or curing the cancer is much harder.
Discussing your treatment
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be a difficult process. There’s a lot to take in, so it’s important to talk about the possible alternatives with a family member or friend.
You should also have an in-depth discussion with your doctor, who can tell you the pros and cons of the treatments available to you.
If at any stage you don’t understand the treatment options being explained to you, make sure you ask your doctor for more details.
There are 3 main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated:
surgery
chemotherapy
radiotherapy
Some types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 or a combination of all 3.
Cancer Research UK has more information about
types of treatment for pancreatic cancer
.
Surgery
Surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. However, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it’s diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20% of people.
However, this isn’t a suitable option if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. If your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won’t cure you.
Surgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of health. This is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow.
Sometimes the risks of surgery can outweigh the potential benefits.
Your doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option.
Whipple procedure
The Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas.
Your surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores bile) and part of your bile duct. Sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed.
The end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. This allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into your system.
After this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food.
The Whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it’s easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy.
Distal pancreatectomy
A distal pancreatectomy involves removing the tail and body of your pancreas.
Your spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. Part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed.
Like the Whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation that won’t be carried out unless your doctor thinks it’s necessary.
Total pancreatectomy
During a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. This is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour.
Your surgeon will also remove your:
bile duct
gall bladder
spleen
part of your small intestine
part of your stomach (sometimes)
surrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system)
After a total pancreatectomy, you’ll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. You’ll also have
diabetes
for the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin – the hormone that regulates blood sugar.
Removing your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood’s ability to clot. This means you’ll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you’re allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you’ll need to have regular vaccinations.
Sometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. Platelets are a type of blood cell that cause your blood to clot (thicken).
Surgery to ease your symptoms
Although surgery may not be a suitable way of removing your tumour, you may be offered it to help ease your symptoms.
This type of surgery won’t cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable.
To help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin – the yellow chemical in bile – from building up and causing jaundice.
If a stent isn’t a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. Your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away.
These types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. The recovery time is much quicker, and people find that their jaundice improves significantly.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer medicines to either kill the cancerous (malignant) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.
Chemotherapy treatment is often used alongside surgery and radiotherapy (see below) to help ensure that as much of the cancer is treated as possible.
Chemotherapy may be given:
before surgery – to try to shrink the cancer, so there’s a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer
after surgery – to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back
when surgery isn’t possible – to try to shrink the cancer, slow its growth and relieve your symptoms
Some chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously).
Chemotherapy also attacks normal, healthy cells, which is why this type of treatment can have many side effects. The most common side effects include:
vomiting
nausea
mouth sores
fatigue
increased risk of infection
These are usually only temporary, and should improve once you’ve completed your treatment.
The chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of 2 or 3.
Combining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects. Sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is a form of cancer therapy that uses high-energy beams of
radiation
to help shrink your tumour and relieve pain.
Side effects of radiotherapy can include:
fatigue
skin rashes
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
nausea or vomiting
These side effects are usually only temporary, and should improve after your treatment has been completed.

Symptoms of pancreatic cancer
In its early stages, pancreatic cancer rarely causes symptoms.
The pancreas is actually 2 glands in one, and symptoms depend on which part is affected. This is because:
the exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body
the endocrine pancreas produces hormones – including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stable
Most cases of pancreatic cancer are in the exocrine pancreas, and the 3 most common symptoms are:
pain in the stomach or back
jaundice
weight loss
It’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions and aren’t usually the result of cancer. However, you should contact your GP if you’re concerned, or if you suddenly develop these symptoms.
Pain in the stomach or back
Pancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may spread to your back.
To begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer.
The pain is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten. You may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged.
Weight loss
Many types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need.
Pancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body.
If a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods.
This can cause you to lose weight and become malnourished.
Jaundice
Jaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body.
The most obvious sign of jaundice is yellow skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes. It also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured.
Bilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and into the intestine.
Jaundice is more often a sign of conditions such as
gallstones
or
hepatitis
than it is of cancer.
However, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up in the body.
Diabetes
The pancreas produces the hormone insulin. Without it, the body can’t move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells.
The main symptoms of diabetes include:
excessive thirst
urinating frequently – particularly at night
extreme tiredness
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
You may develop
diabetes
if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.
Other possible symptoms
Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:
itching (if you have jaundice)
nausea and vomiting
bowel changes
fever and shivering
indigestion
blood clots
Endocrine pancreatic cancer
Endocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon.
There are a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.
Causes of pancreatic cancer
The exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn’t fully understood. However, there are a number of risk factors that can increase your chances of developing it.
Age
Pancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. Almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over.
Smoking
Research has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated with
smoking
and other tobacco use.
Smoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.
This is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation within your body’s organs and tissues.
Diabetes
If you have
diabetes
, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be increased.
However, it’s important to remember that diabetes is very common and most people with diabetes won’t develop pancreatic cancer.
As well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it’s also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes.
Chronic pancreatitis and hereditary pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis
(long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but isn’t responsible for many cases. Chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-term
alcohol misuse
.
Although it’s a very rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population.
Helicobacter pylori infection
Helicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer.
Research has shown that a Helicobacter pylori infection may slightly increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. However, the risk is thought to be small because most people with this infection don’t get cancer of the pancreas.
Other known risk factors
There are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These are:
long-term
hepatitis
tooth or
gum disease
heavy alcohol use
a previous history of certain types of
cancer
previously having
radiotherapy
diet
,
weight
and level of
physical activity
The
Cancer Research UK
website has more information about these
other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer
.
Diagnosing pancreatic cancer
In the early stages, pancreatic cancer often causes no symptoms. This can make it difficult to diagnose.
If you visit your GP with
symptoms of pancreatic cancer
, they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice.
They may also test your urine for bile, or carry out a
blood test
. This is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer.
Your GP may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. The pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it’s covered by part of the bowel. This can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination.
If your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll be referred for further testing at a hospital.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
Ultrasound scan
An
ultrasound scan
is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.
If pancreatic cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal.
However, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren’t very good at penetrating deep into body tissues.
Computerised tomography (CT) scan
A
computerised tomography (CT) scan
produces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series of
X-ray
images.
Your doctor can use the results of a CT scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
A
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of X-rays.
MRI scans are carried out in a tube-shaped MRI scanner. It’s a noisy procedure that can feel claustrophobic. It also takes longer than other types of scans.
Like a CT scan, an MRI scan allows your doctor to check for signs of
cancer
in other parts of the body.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.
Before the scan, you’ll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as a tracer. The amount of radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal X-ray.
The most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar). You’ll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy.
The scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. The tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue.
Endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)
If a small shadow is seen on a CT or MRI scan but it’s not obvious what it is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) can be carried out.
During EUS, a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach.
An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas.
Before the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. EUS can also be used to take a
biopsy
for further examination.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if someone has jaundice.
During ERCP, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. The endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts.
After the dye has been injected, an X-ray will be taken. The dye will show up on the X-ray and will highlight any tumour that’s blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts.
During the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. These samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous.
ERCP can take 30 to 60 minutes. As with EUS, you’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax.
Laparoscopy
A laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis.
During the procedure, a small incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin, flexible microscope) will be inserted.
This will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn’t spread before recommending its removal.
This procedure will be carried out under a
general anaesthetic
(where you’re put to sleep so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort).
Biopsy
A
biopsy
involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which can then be tested to see if it’s cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).
A biopsy can be carried out during an EUS, ERCP or laparoscopy using a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells.
It’s also possible for a biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. The needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or CT scan.
Recovering pancreatic cancer
Recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.
You’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.
After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away.
You’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.
After the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course of
chemotherapy
, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. However, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely.
Treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/chromosomal-conditions/pataus-syndrome/,"Patau’s syndrome
Patau’s syndrome, also known as Trisomy 13, is a rare but serious genetic condition. It begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and will continue to cause health problems throughout their life.
In the UK, around 2 in every 10,000 births are affected by Patau’s syndrome.
What is Patau’s syndrome?
When a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome.
Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.
If a baby has Patau’s syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.
There are 3 different forms of Patau’s syndrome:
Full form
In full form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells.
Around 80% of babies born with Patau’s syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.
Mosaic form
In mosaic form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells.
Partial form
In partial form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 13. This is a very rare form of Patau’s syndrome.
Why does Patau’s syndrome happen?
Most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.
Effects of Patau’s syndrome on pregnancy
Screening for Patau’s syndrome
You’ll be offered
screening for Patau’s syndrome
when you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.
The screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Patau’s syndrome.
If screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has Patau’s syndrome, you can choose to have a further
diagnostic test
if you wish.
No test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Patau’s syndrome, or how they’ll be affected.
Risk of miscarriage and stillbirth
Around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Patau’s syndrome from screening tests will end in
miscarriage
or
stillbirth
.
The risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth.
Effects of Patau’s syndrome on babies
If your baby is affected by Patau’s syndrome, it’s likely they will have some health conditions. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Patau’s syndrome they have.
Babies with full form Patau’s syndrome
Full form Patau’s syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live.
Around 4 in 10 (43.1%) babies with full form Patau’s syndrome will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (9.7%) will live longer than 5 years.
Babies born with full form Patau’s syndrome will have a learning disability that may be severe. They’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically:
around 8 in 10 (80%) will have heart issues
around 6 in 10 (60%) will have cleft lip and/or palate
around 6 in 10 (60%) will have issues with brain development
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity)
around 5 in 10 (50%) will have eye issues or an absent eye
Babies with mosaic form and partial form Patau’s syndrome
Currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau’s syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on:
how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic)
how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)
Some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Patau’s syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.
Most babies with a form of Patau’s syndrome will have some form of learning disability.
The life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau’s syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.
Living with Patau’s syndrome
Each child is unique, and Patau’s syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they will have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.
Babies with full form Patau’s syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered “medically fragile”. This means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. They may also:
have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube
have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)
Despite their complex needs, children with Patau’s syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.
Many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school.
Feedback from many parents suggests that children with Patau’s syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.
Congenital and rare condition register
Babies with Patau’s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.
The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.
It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/pelvic-organ-prolapse/,"Pelvic organ prolapse
Pelvic organ prolapse is when one or more of the pelvic organs (your womb, bladder or bowel) slip from their usual position. This causes the vaginal wall to bulge into, or out of, the vagina.
Pelvic organ prolapse isn’t life-threatening. In some cases it can cause little or no problems. However, in more severe cases, it may feel very uncomfortable. It might stop you doing the things that you enjoy, and affect your quality of life. Like incontinence, prolapse isn’t inevitable part of ageing.
Speak to your doctor if you think you might have a prolapse. You don’t need to suffer or feel embarrassed. Many women can experience prolapse, but it can be treated.
Symptoms
Some women with a pelvic organ prolapse don’t have any symptoms at all. The condition may only discovered during an internal examination for another reason. For example, during a
cervical screening test (smear test)
. Other women will experience symptoms. It’s normal for your symptoms to feel more or less severe at different times of the day.
Speak to your doctor if:
You think you might have a prolapse or you have symptoms of a prolapse such as:
a feeling of a bulge or something coming down the vagina
a feeling of a bulge or something coming out the vagina, which sometimes needs pushed back up (you may be able to see this with a mirror)
discomfort during sex
problems peeing – a slow stream, a feeling of not emptying your bladder fully, needing to go to the toilet a lot or leaking
Diagnosis
A prolapse is a common condition. Seeing your doctor earlier may help you manage it more easily.
Your doctor will need to carry out a pelvic examination, which will include an internal examination of your vagina. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
As this is an intimate examination, the doctor may have another person (chaperone) present. You can ask for a female doctor or health professional if you prefer.
The internal examination is similar to a smear test and should only take a few minutes. Your doctor will discuss with you if they think any further tests are needed.
Types of prolapse
Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of vagina. The main types of prolapse are:
anterior prolapse (cystocele) – where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina
prolapse of the womb and / or cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) – where the womb and / or cervix bulges down in to the vagina
‘vault’ prolapse – this can be as a result of a total hysterectomy where the new ‘top’ of the vagina bulges downwards
posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) – when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina
You can have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time.
A number system of 1 to 4 is usually used to describe how severe a pelvic organ prolapse is. For example, a 4 means a severe prolapse. You can ask your healthcare professional what this means for you, and any other questions you may have.
Causes
There isn’t usually one cause, but the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse is increased by:
age – prolapse is more common as you get older, but it’s not an inevitable part of ageing
childbirth – particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or have given birth to a large baby or multiple babies
menopause
– related to lower levels of oestrogen or weaker tissue
being overweight
having large
fibroids
or pelvic cysts which create a lot of pressure in the pelvis
previous surgery on the pelvis – such as a hysterectomy
repeated heavy lifting or manual work
long term coughing or sneezing (caused by smoking, a lung condition or allergies)
straining too much when going to the toilet for a poo because of long term
constipation
Prevention
There are things you can do to reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse.
Exercising your pelvic floor
Do
regular pelvic floor exercises to strength pelvic floor muscles
maintain a healthy weight
eat a high-fibre diet to avoid constipation or straining when you go to the toilet for a poo
adopt good toilet habits
avoid heavy lifting
How to exercise your pelvic floor muscles
Treatment
Treatment will depend on how much the issue is affecting your normal day to day activities.
In mild cases of prolapse, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes. For example, regular pelvic floor exercises and maintaining a healthy weight.
Vaginal pessary
A vaginal pessary is a device inserted into your vagina, which holds your vaginal walls in place and so pushes the prolapse back. Pessaries are usually made of latex (rubber) or silicone, and come in different shapes and sizes.
A pessary might not be right for everyone. Your doctor will discuss with you to find out if it’s the best option, and you can ask any questions you may have. Some side effects can include:
vaginal discharge
irritation, bleeding or sores inside your vagina
stress incontinence
difficulty with bowel movements
difficulty having sex (although most women can have sex without problems)
an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in your vagina
If you have a pessary and experience any of these symptoms, speak to your healthcare professional. They can usually be treated.
Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
HRT
replaces the female hormones that are at a lower level as you experience the menopause.
There is little evidence that HRT can directly treat pelvic organ prolapse, but it can relieve some of the symptoms associated with it. For example, vaginal dryness or discomfort during sex. Depending on your symptoms, you may wish to ask your doctor for more advice on whether this would be a suitable treatment option for you.
Surgery
Depending on your circumstances and how severe your symptoms are, your doctor may discuss with you whether a surgery might be helpful. They will go through the options with you.
It’s ok to ask any questions about your care
to help you get the information you might need. You can then take some time to decide what the best option is for you."

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a bacterial infection. It affects the female reproductive system including the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries.
Symptoms of PID
PID often does not cause any obvious symptoms.
Most symptoms are mild, making it difficult to diagnose.
Symptoms include:
pain around the pelvis or lower tummy
discomfort or pain during sex that is felt deep inside the pelvis
pain when peeing
bleeding between periods or after sex
heavy periods
painful periods
unusual vaginal discharge
Less common symptoms include:
severe tummy pain
a high temperature (fever)
feeling and being sick
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if:
you have symptoms of PID
you’re worried about your symptoms
Testing for PID
If you think you might have PID, get checked for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
What does a PID test involve?
There is no single test for diagnosing PID.
Your doctor or nurse will discuss your symptoms before you have an internal examination. This shouldn’t be painful, but you may experience some discomfort.
When your doctor examines you, they’ll look for tenderness in your pelvic region and an abnormal vaginal discharge.
The doctor will usually take swabs from inside your vagina and cervix. These will be sent to a lab for analysis. However, a swab test can’t be relied on to diagnose PID, as some women with PID have a negative swab result.
You may have an ultrasound scan. Scans can identify severe PID but will not show up mild disease. It’s possible to have a normal scan and still have PID.
Treatment for PID
If it’s diagnosed at an early stage, oral antibiotics will treat PID. You’ll probably be given these to take for at least 2 weeks.
In more severe cases, you may be admitted to hospital for observation and treatment with antibiotic injections.
Always see your doctor or nurse if you think you might have PID, as the sooner you are treated, the better. If you’re given treatment, always make sure that you take all of your antibiotics and finish the entire course.
Your partner(s) should also be treated and you should avoid sex until your treatment is completed.
How PID is passed on
Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that’s spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.
Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. However, most cases are the result of a
chlamydia
or
gonorrhoea
infection.
In some cases, the cause of the infection that leads to PID is unknown. Such cases may be the result of normally harmless bacteria found in the vagina. These bacteria can sometimes get past the cervix and into the reproductive organs.
Complications of PID
If left untreated, PID can cause serious conditions including:
pelvic abscesses
long-term pelvic pain, or pelvic pain that keeps coming back
reduced fertility or infertility
ectopic pregnancy
How to prevent PID
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
STIs
If you have been diagnosed with PID you should get tested for all STIs including:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis

About pleurisy
Causes of pleurisy
Treating pleurisy
About pleurisy
Pleurisy is inflammation of the sheet-like layers that cover the lungs (the pleura).
The most common symptom of pleurisy is a sharp chest pain when breathing deeply. Sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder.
The pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around, and it may be relieved by taking shallow breaths.
Other symptoms can include shortness of breath and a dry
cough
.
Visit your GP if you experience the above symptoms. Seek immediate medical help if your chest pain is severe, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as coughing up blood, nausea or sweating.
Seeing your GP
Pleurisy can usually be diagnosed by studying your symptoms. Your GP can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy.
Further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is. These can include:
blood tests
to determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition
chest
X-rays
an
ultrasound scan
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
biopsy
– a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testing
What causes pleurisy?
Most cases are the result of a viral infection (such as the
flu
) or a bacterial infection (such as
pneumonia
).
In rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or
lung cancer
.
Pleurisy can affect people of all ages, but people of 65 years and over are most at risk, because they’re more likely to develop a
chest infection
.
Read more about the
causes of pleurisy
.
How is pleurisy treated?
Treatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause.
For example, pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve itself without treatment. However, pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated with
antibiotics
, and people who are frail or already in poor health may be admitted to hospital.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as
ibuprofen
, are often used to relieve the chest pain associated with pleurisy.
If excess fluid builds up between the pleural layers, it may be necessary to drain the fluid to prevent breathing difficulties.
Read more about
treating pleurisy
.
Causes of pleurisy
Pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura. It’s usually caused by another condition, such as an infection, but sometimes no cause can be identified.
The pleura are two thin sheets of tissue that separate the lungs and ribcage. One is attached to the ribcage and the other is attached to the lungs.
Between the pleural sheets is a thin layer of liquid that lubricates the pleura, helping to reduce friction when you breathe in and out.
When there’s inflammation, the surfaces of the two layers can become rough and the fluid can become sticky. This can cause the layers to rub together, resulting in pain and discomfort.
Infection
An infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. Any type of infection has the potential to spread to the pleura, but viral infections are usually responsible. Viruses known to cause pleurisy include:
the
influenza (flu)
virus
the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes
glandular fever
cytomegalovirus (CMV) – a common virus found in most people, which doesn’t usually cause any noticeable symptoms
parainfluenza – the virus that causes the childhood condition croup
In some cases, pleurisy is caused by bacteria, such as:
streptococcal bacteria – often associated with
pneumonia
, throat infections and some types of skin infections, such as
impetigo
and
cellulitis
staphylococcal bacteria – often associated with skin infections,
food poisoning
and, more seriously,
blood poisoning (sepsis)
Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause pleurisy, especially in hospital patients. MRSA is a type of bacteria with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics.
Other causes
Other possible causes of pleurisy include:
injury – if the ribs are bruised or fractured, the pleura can become inflamed
pulmonary embolism – a blood clot developing inside the lungs
sickle cell anaemia
– a blood disorder that usually affects people of African or Caribbean descent
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
HIV or AIDS
lung cancer
mesothelioma
– a type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos
Autoimmune conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
and
lupus
, are other possible causes of pleurisy. In these conditions, something goes wrong with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) and it begins to attack healthy tissue.
Treating pleurisy
Treatment for pleurisy usually involves relieving pain and treating the underlying cause of the condition.
If treated promptly, pleurisy often resolves without any lasting damage to the lungs.
Treating pain
The chest pain associated with pleurisy can be treated using a type of painkiller known as
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
. Most often,
ibuprofen
is used.
If NSAIDs are ineffective or unsuitable, you may be prescribed another painkiller, such as
paracetamol
or codeine.
It may seem strange, but lying down on the side of your chest that hurts may also help to reduce the pain.
Treating the underlying cause
It may also be necessary to treat the underlying cause of your pleurisy.
If you have pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll need a course of
antibiotics
. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may be either tablets or injections. Combinations of different antibiotics are sometimes used.
However, if your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, further treatment may not be required, as the infection usually resolves itself after a few days.
In cases where your symptoms are particularly severe or you’re already in poor health, you may need to be admitted to hospital so your body’s functions can be supported until your condition stabilises.
Pleural effusion
In some cases, pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion.
Pleural effusion can result in shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. This is more likely in cases of pleurisy caused by pulmonary embolism or a bacterial infection.
If pleural effusion doesn’t clear up as your pleurisy is treated, or if you’re very short of breath, a tube will need to be inserted so the fluid can be drained away.
The tube may be inserted using either
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep) or
local anaesthetic
(the area where the tube is inserted is numbed).
If a lot of fluid has to be drained away, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days."

About polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition that causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips.
The main symptom is muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes. It may also cause other symptoms, including:
high temperature (fever) and sweating
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
loss of appetite
weight loss
depression
If you have pain and stiffness that lasts longer than a week, you should see your GP so the cause can be investigated.
Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, including
rheumatoid arthritis
. These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed.

symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica
and
diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica
.
What causes polymyalgia rheumatica?
The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible.
Polymyalgia rheumatica is relatively common in the UK. It’s estimated that one in every 1,200 people develop the condition every year.
Polymyalgia rheumatica is age-related. Most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. It’s extremely rare in people younger than 50. It’s also more common in women than men.
Treating polymyalgia rheumatica
The main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica is a
coritcosteroid medication
called prednisolone, which is used to help relieve the symptoms.
You’ll initially be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone, which will be reduced gradually over time.
Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need to take a long-term course of corticosteroid treatment (lasting 18 months to two years) to prevent their symptoms returning.
Read more about
treating polymyalgia rheumatica
.
Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica
The most common symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is pain and stiffness in the shoulder muscles, which develops quickly over a few days or weeks.
The muscles in the neck and hips are also often affected. Both sides of the body are usually affected.
The stiffness often feels worse first thing in the morning after you wake up and starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.
Some people with polymyalgia rheumatica have additional symptoms, including:
a mild high temperature (fever) of 37-38C (98.6-100.4F)
depression
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
loss of appetite
weight loss
When to seek medical advice
If you have symptoms of pain and stiffness that last longer than a week, you should make an appointment to see your GP so that the cause can be investigated.
When to seek immediate medical advice
You should seek immediate medical advice if you have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica (or the condition is suspected) and you suddenly develop:
a persistent and severe
headache
jaw pain or cramping in your jaw muscles which is worse when you’re eating
pain in the tongue when chewing
vision loss or vision disturbances, such as double vision
These symptoms may indicate a more serious condition called giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).
Call your GP immediately for advice if you have any of the above symptoms. If this isn’t possible, contact your local
out of hours service
or call the NHS 24 ‘111’ service.
Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica
Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can often be quite a lengthy process that involves several different tests.
This is because the condition shares many symptoms with more common health conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
, which need to be ruled out first.
Tests
There’s no specific test for polymyalgia rheumatica, but it’s likely that a series of
blood tests
will be carried out.
Two blood tests –
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and
C-reactive protein (CRP)
– can be used to check the levels of inflammation in your body.
If the ESR and CRP test results are normal, it’s unlikely that polymyalgia rheumatica will be diagnosed because your doctor won’t want to prescribe a long-term course of steroids if the diagnosis is uncertain. Sometimes, the ESR may be normal and CRP may be raised, which would be more likely to indicate a positive diagnosis. This is why both tests are usually carried out at the same time.
As inflammation is a characteristic of many conditions, high levels don’t automatically mean that you have polymyalgia rheumatica. Further tests may be needed to help rule out other conditions that cause inflammation. For example, a test for
rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies
, may be carried out to rule out rheumatoid arthritis.
Blood tests can also help determine:
whether there’s an infection in your blood
how well some of your organs, such as your kidneys, are working
whether you have an
overactive thyroid gland
or an
underactive thyroid gland
(both conditions can cause muscle pain)
You may also have a urine test to check how well your liver is functioning.
X-rays
and
ultrasound scans
may also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints.
Symptom checklist
After other possible causes of your symptoms have been ruled out, a checklist can be used to see whether your symptoms match those most commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.
A confident diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can usually be made if you meet all of the following criteria:
you’re over 50 years of age
you have pain in your shoulders or your hips
you have stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes
your symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks
blood tests show raised levels of inflammation in your body
your symptoms rapidly improve after treatment with
corticosteroids
Read more about
treating polymyalgia rheumatica
.
Treating polymyalgia rheumatica
Steroid medication (
corticosteroids
) is the preferred treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).
A type of corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually prescribed.
Prednisolone
Prednisolone works by blocking the effects of certain chemicals that cause inflammation inside your body. It doesn’t cure polymyalgia rheumatica, but it can help relieve the symptoms.
When used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisolone is taken as a tablet. Most people will be prescribed several tablets to take once a day.
You’ll be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone initially, and the dose will be gradually reduced every one to two months.
Although your symptoms should improve within a few days of starting treatment, you’ll probably need to continue taking a low dose of prednisolone for about two years.
In many cases, polymyalgia rheumatica improves on its own after this time. However, there’s a chance that the condition will return (relapse) once treatment stops.
Don’t suddenly stop taking steroid medication unless a doctor in charge of your care tells you it’s safe to do so. Suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you feel very ill.
Side effects of prednisolone
About one in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state when they take the medication.
You may feel
depressed
and
suicidal
, anxious or confused. Some people also experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there). Contact your GP as soon as possible if you experience changes to your mental state.
Other side effects of prednisolone include:
increased appetite that often leads to weight gain
increased blood pressure
mood changes, such as becoming aggressive or irritable with people
weakening of the bones (
osteoporosis
)
stomach ulcers
increased risk of infection, particularly with the varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes
chickenpox
and
shingles
)
Seek immediate medical advice if you think you’ve been exposed to the varicella-zoster virus, or if a member of your household develops chickenpox or shingles.
The risk of these side effects should improve as your dose of prednisolone is decreased.
See
side effects of corticosteroids
for more information about how these side effects may affect you and how they’re treated.
Other medications
Sometimes, other medicines may be combined with corticosteroids to help prevent relapses or to allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced.
Some people are prescribed immunosuppressant medication, such as methotrexate. This is used to reduce or suppress the immune system (the body’s defence against infection and illness). It may be helpful for people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or don’t respond to normal steroid treatment.
Your doctor may recommend painkillers, such as
paracetamol
, or
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, to help relieve pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced.
Follow-up
Your GP will ask you to attend regular follow-up appointments to check how well you’re responding to treatment, whether your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted, and how well you’re coping with the side effects of the medication.
During these appointments, you’ll have
blood tests
to check the levels of inflammation inside your body.
Follow-up appointments are usually recommended every few weeks for the first three months and then at three- to six-monthly intervals after this time.
Contact your GP if your symptoms return during any part of your treatment. Your dosage may need to be adjusted."

About peripheral neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body’s extremities – such as the hands, feet and arms – are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected.
In the UK, it’s estimated that almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over are affected by some degree of peripheral neuropathy.
The peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).
It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including:
sensory nerves – responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch
motor nerves – responsible for controlling muscles
autonomic nerves – responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy
The main symptoms can include:
numbness and tingling in the feet or hands
burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas
loss of balance and co-ordination
muscle weakness, especially in the feet
These symptoms are usually constant, but may come and go.
Read more about symptoms of peripheral neuropathy
When to see your GP
It’s important to see your GP if you experience the early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as:
pain, tingling or loss of sensation in the feet
loss of balance or weakness
a cut or ulcer on your foot that isn’t getting better
It’s recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes, have regular check-ups.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to a hospital to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system).
Generally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.
Read more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy
Causes of peripheral neuropathy
In the UK, diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.
Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by:
physical injury to the nerves
a viral infection such as
shingles
a side effect of certain medications or drinking too much alcohol
People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed.
Read more about the causes of peripheral neuropathy
Treating peripheral neuropathy
Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.
Only some of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking, and cut down on alcohol.
Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medications called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers are often ineffective.
If you have other symptoms, these may need to be treated individually. For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and the use of walking aids.
Read more about treating peripheral neuropathy
.
Complications of peripheral neuropathy
The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged.
Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time.
If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy isn’t treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated.
Peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, a
pacemaker
.
Read more about complications of peripheral neuropathy
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy
Symptoms vary according to the type of peripheral neuropathy and may develop quickly or slowly.
The main types of peripheral neuropathy include:
sensory neuropathy – damage to the nerves that carry messages of touch, temperature, pain and other sensations to the brain
motor neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control movement
autonomic neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control involuntary bodily processes, such as digestion, bladder function and control of blood pressure
mononeuropathy – damage to a single nerve outside of the central nervous system
In many cases, someone with peripheral neuropathy may have more than one of these types at the same time.
A combination of sensory and motor neuropathy is particularly common (sensorimotor polyneuropathy).
The symptoms of the main types of peripheral neuropathy are described below.
Sensory neuropathy
Symptoms of sensory neuropathy can include:
prickling and tingling sensation in the affected body part pins and needles
numbness and less of an ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, particularly in your feet
a burning or sharp pain, usually in the feet
feeling pain from something that should not be painful at all, such as a very light touch (allodynia)
loss of balance or co-ordination caused by less ability to tell the position of the feet or hands (sensory ataxia)
Motor neuropathy
Symptoms of motor neuropathy can include:
twitching and muscle cramps
muscle weakness or paralysis affecting one or more muscles
thinning (wasting) of muscles
foot drop – difficulty lifting up the front part of your foot and toes, particularly noticeable when walking
Autonomic neuropathy
Damage to the autonomic nerves can result in a wide range of symptoms depending on where in the body the damage occurs.
Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy can include:
constipation
or
diarrhoea
, particularly at night
feeling sick, bloating and belching
low blood pressure
(postural or orthostatic hypotension), which can make you feel faint or dizzy when standing up
rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
excessive sweating
or a lack of sweating
problems with sexual function, such as
erectile dysfunction
in men
difficulty fully emptying your bladder of urine
bowel incontinence
(loss of bowel control)
Mononeuropathy
Depending on the specific nerve affected, symptoms of mononeuropathy can include:
altered sensation or weakness in the fingers
double vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain
weakness of one side of your face Bell’s palsy
foot or shin pain, weakness or altered sensation
The most common type of mononeuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The carpal tunnel is a small tunnel in your wrist.
In CTS, the median nerve becomes compressed where it passes through this tunnel, which may cause tingling, pain or numbness in the fingers.
Causes of peripheral neuropathy
Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the UK.
Neuropathy can also be caused by other health conditions and certain medications. In some cases, no cause can be identified and this is termed idiopathic neuropathy.
Diabetes
Peripheral neuropathy caused by either
type 1 diabetes
or
type 2 diabetes
is called diabetic polyneuropathy. It’s probably caused by high levels of glucose in your blood damaging the tiny blood vessels that supply your nerves.
Peripheral neuropathy becomes more likely the longer you’ve had diabetes. Up to 1 in every 4 people with the condition experience some pain caused by nerve damage.
If you have diabetes, your risk of polyneuropathy is higher if your blood sugar is poorly controlled or you:
smoke
regularly consume large amounts of alcohol
are over 40 years old
If you have diabetes, you should examine your own feet regularly to check for ulcers (open wounds or sores) or chilblains.
Other causes
As well as diabetes, there are many other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy.
Health conditions
Some of the health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include:
excessive alcohol drinking for years
low levels of vitamin B12 or other vitamins
physical damage to the nerves – such as from an injury or during surgery
an
underactive thyroid gland
(hypothyroidism)
certain infections – such as
shingles
,
Lyme disease
, diphtheria, botulism and
HIV
inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis)
chronic liver disease or
chronic kidney disease
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) – the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood
certain types of cancer, such as
lymphoma
(a cancer of the lymphatic system) and
multiple myeloma
(a type of bone marrow cancer)
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and other types of hereditary motor sensory neuropathy – genetic conditions that cause nerve damage, particularly in the feet
having high levels of toxins in your body, such as arsenic, lead or mercury
Guillain-Barré syndrome – a rare condition that causes rapid onset of paralysis within days
amyloidosis – a group of rare but serious conditions caused by deposits of abnormal protein called amyloid in tissues and organs throughout the body
conditions caused by overactivity of the immune system – such as
rheumatoid arthritis
,
lupus
or
Sjogren’s syndrome
Medication
A few medications may sometimes cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect in some people. These include:
some types of
chemotherapy
for cancer – especially for
bowel cancer
, lymphoma or
myeloma
some antibiotics, if taken for months – such as metronidazole or nitrofurantoin
phenytoin – used to treat
epilepsy
– if taken for a long time
amiodarone and thalidomide
Diagnosing peripheral neuropathy
A number of tests may be used to diagnose peripheral neuropathy and its underlying cause.
When you see your GP, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area of your body. This may involve testing sensation, strength and reflexes.
Your doctor may also arrange blood tests, especially to check for causes such as
diabetes
or
vitamin B12 deficiency
.
Confirming if you have a neuropathy
Some people may need to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system) in hospital for further tests such as:
a nerve conduction test (NCS) – where small metal wires called electrodes are placed on your skin which release tiny electric shocks that stimulate your nerves; the speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured
electromyography (EMG) – where a small needle is inserted through your skin into your muscle and used to measure the electrical activity of your muscles
NCS and EMG are usually carried out at the same time.
Identifying the cause of a neuropathy
Your GP can usually identify the underlying cause of a peripheral neuropathy.
If diabetes is suspected, they can usually make a confident diagnosis based on your symptoms, a physical examination and checking the levels of glucose in your blood and urine.
If you’re taking a medication known to cause peripheral neuropathy, your GP may temporarily stop or reduce your dose to see whether your symptoms improve.
If the cause is uncertain, you may be referred to a neurologist for more extensive blood tests to check:
whether you have a rare acquired cause that may be responsible
whether you have a genetic abnormality, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
You may need a
lumbar puncture
to test the cerebrospinal fluid (a clear, colourless fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord) for inflammation.
Further tests
Occasionally, a nerve
biopsy
may be carried out as part of your diagnosis. This is a minor surgical procedure where a small sample of a peripheral nerve is removed from near your ankle so it can be examined under a microscope.
It’s then checked for changes that could be a sign of certain types of peripheral neuropathy. However, nerve biopsies are rarely needed.
You may also need a scan to look for any underlying cause of your neuropathy, such as:
an
X-ray
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
Treating peripheral neuropathy
Treatment for peripheral neuropathy may include treating any underlying cause or any symptoms you’re experiencing.
Treatment may be more successful for certain underlying causes. For example, ensuring
diabetes
is well controlled may help improve neuropathy or at least stop it getting worse.
Treating the underlying cause
There are many different possible
causes of peripheral neuropathy
, some of which can be treated in different ways. For example:
diabetes can sometimes be controlled by lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly
vitamin B12 deficiency
can be treated with B12 injections or tablets
peripheral neuropathy caused by a medication you’re taking may improve if the medication is stopped
Some less common types of peripheral neuropathy may be treated with medication, such as:
corticosteroids
– powerful anti-inflammatory medication
immunosuppressants – medications that reduce the activity of the immune system
injections of immunoglobulin – mixture of blood proteins called antibodies made by the immune system
However, the underlying cause may not always be untreatable.
Relieving nerve pain
You may also require medication to treat any nerve pain (neuropathic pain) you’re experiencing.
Unlike most other types of pain, neuropathic pain doesn’t usually get better with common painkillers, such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
and other medications are often used.
These should usually be started at the minimum dose, with the dose gradually increased until you notice an effect, because the ideal dose for each person is unpredictable. Higher doses may be better at managing the pain, but are also more likely to cause side effects.
The most common side effects are tiredness, dizziness or feeling “drunk”. If you get these, it may be necessary to reduce your dose. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you experience drowsiness or blurred vision. You also may become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol.
The side effects should improve after a week or two as your body gets used to the medication. However, if your side effects continue, tell your GP as it may be possible to change to a different medication that suits you better.
Even if the first medication tried doesn’t help, others may.
Many of these medications may also be used for treating other conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, anxiety or headaches. If you’re given an
antidepressant
, this may treat pain even if you’re not depressed. This doesn’t mean your doctor suspects you’re depressed.
The main medications recommended for neuropathic pain include:
amitriptyline – also used for treatment of
headaches
and
depression
duloxetine – also used for treatment of bladder problems and depression
pregabalin and gabapentin – also used to treat
epilepsy
, headaches or
anxiety
There are also some additional medications that can be used to relieve pain in a specific area of the body or to relieve particularly severe pain for short periods. These are described below.
Capsaicin cream
If your pain is confined to a particular area of your body and you can’t, or would prefer not to, take the medications above, you may benefit from using capsaicin cream.
Capsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot and is thought to work in neuropathic pain by stopping the nerves sending pain messages to the brain.
A pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream is rubbed on the painful area of skin three or four times a day.
Side effects of capsaicin cream can include skin irritation and a burning sensation in the treated area when you first start treatment.
Don’t use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it.
Lidocaine plaster
This is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic. It’s useful when pain affects only a small area of skin. It’s stuck over the area of painful skin and the local anaesthetic is absorbed into the skin that’s covered.
Tramadol
Tramadol is a powerful painkiller related to morphine that can be used to treat neuropathic pain that doesn’t respond to other treatments your GP can prescribe.
Like all opioids, tramadol can be addictive if it’s taken for a long time. It will usually only be prescribed for a short time. Tramadol can be useful to take at times when your pain is worse.
Common side effects of tramadol include:
feeling sick or vomiting
dizziness
constipation
Treating other symptoms
In addition to treating pain, you may also require treatment to help you manage other symptoms you’re experiencing as a result of peripheral neuropathy.
For example, if you have muscle weakness, you may need physiotherapy to learn exercises to improve your muscle strength. You may also need to wear splints to support weak ankles or use walking aids to help you get around.
Other problems associated with peripheral neuropathy may be treatable with medication, such as:
erectile dysfunction
constipation
the slow movement of food through your stomach (gastroparesis)
In some cases, you may need more invasive treatment, such as botulinum toxin injections for
hyperhidrosis
or
urinary catheterisation
if you have problems emptying your bladder.
Complications of peripheral neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy can sometimes cause other medical problems, such as foot ulcers and heart rhythm changes, and blood circulation problems.
These complications vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition.
Diabetic foot ulcer
A diabetic foot ulcer is an open wound or sore on the skin that’s slow to heal. These are common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.
If you have numb feet, it’s easy to cut your foot by stepping on something sharp.
An ulcer can also occur if you unknowingly develop a blister caused by badly fitting shoes. If you don’t feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting the blister. If the cut or blister gets worse, it may develop into an ulcer.
High blood sugar can damage your blood vessels, causing the blood supply to your feet to become restricted. A reduced blood supply to the skin on your feet means it receives a lower number of infection-fighting cells, which can mean wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene.
Gangrene
If you do develop a wound infection in one of your feet as a result of peripheral neuropathy, there’s a risk this could lead to gangrene (death of part of the skin or underlying tissues).
If gangrene does develop, you may need surgery to remove the damaged tissue (known as debridement) and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In severe cases your toe or foot may need to be amputated.
If you have diabetes, you should take extra care of your feet. Get your feet checked regularly by a podiatrist (a medical professional, also known as a chiropodist, who specialises in foot care).
Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN)
Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is another potentially serious problem that’s common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.
CAN occurs when damage to the peripheral nerves disrupts the automatic functions that control your blood circulation and heartbeat.
The two main noticeable symptoms of CAN are:
an inability to exercise for more than a very short period of time
orthostatic hypotension – a type of low blood pressure that can make you feel dizzy or faint when you stand up
Treating CAN
You may be able to control the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension by using a number of self care techniques, such as:
standing or sitting up slowly and gradually
drinking plenty of fluids to increase the volume of your blood and raise your blood pressure
wearing compression stockings to help prevent blood falling back down into your legs
tilting your bed by raising it at the head end
In some cases, medication may be required to treat orthostatic hypotension.
Two widely used medications are:
fludrocortisone – which works by increasing the volume of your blood
midodrine – which works by tightening your blood vessels
A more serious concern with CAN is that your heart may suddenly develop an abnormal pattern of beating (arrhythmia), which could lead to a cardiac arrest, where your heart stops beating altogether.
To prevent this, you may be prescribed medication to help regulate the beating of your heart, such as flecainide,
beta-blockers
or amiodarone.
If you have CAN, you’ll probably need to have regular check-ups so your heart function can be monitored."

About prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and anyone with a prostate in the UK.
Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years.
Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis).
When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied.
These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or
prostate enlargement
).

What is the prostate?
The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it’s located between the penis and the bladder and surrounds the urethra.
The main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.
Why does prostate cancer happen?
The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older.
For reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean African descent. It’s less common in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent.
Men and anyone with a prostate who have first-degree male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk.

Tests for prostate cancer
There is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you.
The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are
blood tests
, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a
digital rectal examination or DRE
) and a
biopsy
.
The blood test, known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.
This is because the PSA blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. PSA can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (BPH), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. This means a raised PSA can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.
However, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you.

How is prostate cancer treated?
In many cases, treatment is not immediately necessary.
If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ or ‘active surveillance’ may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition.
Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include surgically removing the prostate,
radiotherapy
and hormone therapy.
Some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.
All treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including
erectile dysfunction
and
urinary incontinence
. For this reason, many people choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread.
Newer treatments, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects. Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. However, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known.

Living with prostate cancer
As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.
Nevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as
erectile dysfunction
and
urinary incontinence
, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel
anxious
or
depressed
.
You may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a family doctor and other people with prostate cancer.
Financial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work.

Symptoms of prostate cancer
Prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra.
This normally results in problems associated with urination. Symptoms can include:
needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night
needing to rush to the toilet
difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)
straining or taking a long time while urinating
weak flow
feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully
Your prostate may get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as
prostate enlargement
or benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Symptoms that the cancer may have spread include bone and back pain, a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles and unexplained weight loss.

Cancer Research UK:
prostate cancer symptoms
Causes of prostate cancer
It’s not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
These include:
age – risk rises as you get older and most cases are diagnosed in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age
ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean and African descent than in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent
family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer
obesity – there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer
exercise – men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer
diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer
In addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. However, more research is needed.

Diagnosing prostate cancer
If you have symptoms that could be caused by prostate cancer, you should visit your GP.
There is no single, definitive test for prostate cancer, so your GP will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety.
Your doctor is likely to:
ask for a urine sample to check for infection
take a blood sample to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
examine your prostate (
digital rectal examination
)
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected prostate cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
PSA testing
PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. All men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of PSA in their blood, and it increases with age.
Prostate cancer can increase the production of PSA, and so a PSA test looks for raised levels of PSA in the blood that may be a sign of the condition in its early stages.
However, PSA testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. Most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised PSA level. Most people with a raised PSA level will not have cancer, as PSA levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older.
Read more about
PSA screening for prostate cancer
Digital rectal examination (DRE)
The next step is a DRE, which can be done by your GP.
During a DRE, your GP will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. The rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your GP can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. This will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful.
Prostate cancer can make the gland hard and bumpy. However, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a DRE may not be able to detect the cancer.
DRE is useful in ruling out
prostate enlargement
caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth.
Biopsy
Your GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels, the results of your DRE, and your age, family history and ethnic group. If you are at risk, you should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests.
The most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided
biopsy
(TRUS). A biopsy may also be taken during a
cystoscopy examination
or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum).
During a TRUS biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate.
The procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a
local anaesthetic
to minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection.
Although it is more reliable than a PSA test, the TRUS biopsy can have problems. It can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. The doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present.
You may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your PSA level continues to rise. Your doctor may request an MRI scan of the prostate before another biopsy.
The TRUS biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. Many people often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence and
erectile dysfunction
.
The samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. If cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. This process is known as ‘staging and grading’ and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate.

Cancer Research UK:
the stages of prostate cancer
Macmillan:
grading and staging of prostate cancer
Further testing
If there is a significant chance the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended.
These include:
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or
computerised tomography (CT)
scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body
an isotope bone scan – this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones; a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalities

Testing for prostate cancer
There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. This is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks.
PSA screening
Routinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. There are several reasons for this:
PSA tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) – this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason
the PSA test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life – some men and anyone with a prostate may therefore face difficult decisions about treatment
treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases but the side effects of the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it is absolutely necessary
although screening has been shown to reduce a man’s chance of dying from prostate cancer, it would mean many people receive treatment unnecessarily
More research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm.
One European study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of:
overdiagnosis – people being diagnosed with a cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during their lifetime
overtreatment – people being treated unnecessarily for tumours that would be unlikely to be harmful
Improving the test
As there are many reasons why PSA levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the PSA test, or a variation of it, more accurate. This includes looking at how PSA levels change over time and comparing the PSA level to prostate size.
Researchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as MRI scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated PSA should have a biopsy.
Instead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their GP about PSA testing. It aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a PSA test.
If you’re aged 50 or over with a prostate and decide to have your PSA levels tested after talking to your GP, they will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the NHS.
If results show you have a raised level of PSA, your GP may suggest further tests.
Should I have a PSA test?
Because the results of the PSA test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer.
A PSA test cannot identify prostate cancer on its own, and changes in PSA levels alone are not a good reason to start treatment.
If you are thinking about asking for a PSA test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you with your GP so you understand what the results might mean.
The
Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme
has information on the risks and benefits of the PSA test to help you decide whether or not to have it.
Treating prostate cancer
Staging of prostate cancer
Doctors will use the results of your prostate examination, biopsy and scans to identify the ‘stage’ of your prostate cancer (how far the cancer has spread). The stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary.
A widely used method of staging is a number staging system. The stages are:
stage 1 – the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland
stage 2 – the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger
stage 3 – the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen
stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good.

Cancer Research UK:
the stages of prostate cancer
Watchful waiting
Watchful waiting is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer will affect your natural life span.
If the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. If this happens, pain medication and hormone medication to control prostate cancer are usually used.
Watchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if:
your general health means you are unable to receive any form of treatment
your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it
In this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer.
Active surveillance
Active surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men and anyone with a prostate who needs it.
When they are diagnosed, around half to two-thirds of men and anyone with a prostate with low-risk prostate cancer do not need treatment. Surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing.
Active surveillance involves you having regular PSA tests and often several biopsies to ensure any signs of progression are found as early as possible. Sometimes, MRI scans may also be carried out. If these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing, you can then make a decision about further treatment.
About 1 in 3 people who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. This does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. Good evidence shows that active surveillance is safe over an average of 6 years. Men undergoing active surveillance will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment will be reassured that it was necessary.
Radical prostatectomy
A radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer.
Like any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects:
some people have problems with
urinary incontinence
– t
his can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation
some men have problems getting an erection (
erectile dysfunction
)
– t
his sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems
in extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal
For many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. However, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation.
Radiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery.
After a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. This means that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. You may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

Macmillan:
surgery for early prostate cancer
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. Radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.
Radiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. It is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. There are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy.
You may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.
Short-term effects of radiotherapy can include:
discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body)
diarrhoea
loss of pubic hair
tiredness
cystitis
– an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful
Possible long-term side effects can include:
an inability to obtain an erection
urinary incontinence
back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort)
As with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. In these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. This is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy.
Some hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes as part of a clinical trial. These new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy. These treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known.

Macmillan:
radiotherapy for early prostate cancer
Brachytherapy
Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy.
The radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. This is called low dose-rate brachytherapy.
The radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. This is called high dose-rate brachytherapy.
This method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. However, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK:
internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer
Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. For example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.
Hormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat localised prostate cancer in people who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. This is because it does not cure the cancer on its own. Hormone therapy can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.
Hormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. In particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. The purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone.
Hormone therapy can be given as:
injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists
tablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment
combined LHRH and anti-androgen treatment
The main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. They usually go away when treatment stops. They include loss of sex drive and
erectile dysfunction
(this is more common with LHRH agonists than anti-androgens).
Other possible side effects include:
hot flushes
sweating
weight gain
swelling and tenderness of the breasts
An alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. The operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms.

Cancer Research UK:
hormone therapy for prostate cancer
Trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
During TURP, a thin metal wire with a loop at the end is inserted into your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed.
This is carried out under
general anaesthetic
or a spinal anaesthetic (epidural).
This is done to relieve pressure from the urethra to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination. It does not cure the cancer.
Read more information about
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
.
High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
HIFU is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate.
An ultrasound probe inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. These sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature.
The risk of side effects from HIFU is usually lower than other treatments.
However, possible effects can include impotence (in 5 to 10 in every 100) or urinary incontinence (in less than 1 in every 100). Back passage problems are rare.
Fistulas (an abnormal channel between the urinary system and rectum) are also rare, affecting less than 1 in every 500. This is because the treatment targets the cancer area only and not the whole prostate.
However, HIFU treatment is still going through clinical trials for prostate cancer. In some cases, doctors can carry out HIFU treatment outside of clinical trials. HIFU is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK:
high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. It is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland.
Tiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. They freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die.
The aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. The side effects of cryotherapy can include:
erectile dysfunction – this can affect between 2 and 9 in every 10
incontinence – this affects less than 1 in 20
It is rare for cryotherapy to cause rectal problems or fistulas.
Cryotherapy is still undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer. In some cases, doctors can carry out cryotherapy treatment outside of clinical trials. It is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.
Treating advanced prostate cancer
If the cancer has reached an advanced stage, it is no longer possible to cure it. However, it may be possible to slow its progression, prolong your life and relieve symptoms.
Treatment options include:
radiotherapy
hormone treatment
chemotherapy
If the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. Bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy.
Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. Chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected.
The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. They include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you.
Steroids
Steroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. This is called hormone-refractory cancer.
Steroids can be used to try to shrink the tumour and stop it from growing. The most effective steroid treatment is dexamethasone.
Other medical treatments
There are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. Your medical team can tell you if these are suitable and available for you.
NICE has recently issued guidance on medications called abiraterone and enzalutamide.
Read the NICE guidelines on:
enzalutamide for metastatic hormone-relapsed prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel
abiraterone for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen
Deciding against treatment
As many of the treatments above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life, you may decide against treatment. This may be especially true if you are at an age when you feel that treating the cancer is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy.
This is entirely your decision, and your MDT will respect it.
If you decide not to have treatment, your GP and hospital team will still give you support and pain relief. This is called
palliative care
. Support is also available for your family and friends.
Living with prostate cancer
Impact on everyday activities
If you have no symptoms, prostate cancer should have little or no effect on your everyday activities. You should be able to work, care for your family, carry on your usual social and leisure activities, and look after yourself. However, you may be understandably worried about your future. This may make you feel
anxious
or
depressed
, and affect your sleep.
If your prostate cancer progresses, you may not feel well enough to do all the things you used to. After an operation or other treatment, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, you will probably feel tired and need time to recover.
If you have advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, you may have symptoms that slow you down and make it difficult to do things. You may have to reduce your working hours or stop working altogether.
Whatever stage your prostate cancer has reached, try to give yourself time to do the things you enjoy and spend time with those who care about you.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK:
coping with prostate cancer
Complications of prostate cancer
Erection problems
If you have
erectile dysfunction
, speak to your GP. It may be possible to treat you with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.
The most commonly used PDE5 is sildenafil (Viagra). Other PDE5s are available if sildenafil is not effective.
Another alternative is a device called a vacuum pump. It is a simple tube connected to a pump. You place your penis in the tube and then pump out all the air. This creates a vacuum, which causes the blood to rush to your penis. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis. This keeps the blood in place and allows you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.
Urinary incontinence
If your
urinary incontinence
is mild, you may be able to control it by learning some simple exercises. Pelvic floor exercises can strengthen your control over your bladder.
To carry out pelvic floor exercises:
Sit or lie comfortably with your knees slightly apart.
Squeeze or lift at the front as if you were trying to stop the passage of urine, then squeeze or lift at the back as if you were trying to stop the passage of wind.
Hold this contraction for as long as you can (at least 2 seconds, increasing up to 10 as you improve).
Relax for the same amount of time before repeating.
If your urinary incontinence is more severe, it may be possible to treat it with surgery. This would involve implanting an artificial sphincter – a sphincter is a muscle used to control the bladder.

Relationships
Being diagnosed with prostate cancer often brings families and friends closer, although it can put pressure on relationships too.
Most people want to help, though they may not know what to do. A few people find it hard to talk to someone with prostate cancer, and may try to avoid them. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put others at ease. But do not feel shy about telling people that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.

About pneumonia
Treating pneumonia
About pneumonia
Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It’s usually caused by a bacterial infection.
At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid.
Symptoms of pneumonia
The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days.
Common symptoms of pneumonia include:
a
cough
– which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm)
difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting
rapid heartbeat
fever
feeling generally unwell
sweating and shivering
loss of appetite
chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing
Less common symptoms include:
coughing up blood (haemoptysis)
headaches
fatigue
nausea or vomiting
wheezing
joint and muscle pain
feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people
When to see your GP
See your GP if you feel unwell and you have typical symptoms of pneumonia.
Seek urgent medical attention if you’re experiencing severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, chest pain or confusion.
Who’s affected?
In the UK, pneumonia affects around 8 in 1,000 adults each year. It’s more widespread in autumn and winter.
Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it’s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly.
People in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia.
What causes pneumonia?
Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi.
As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include:
viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by the
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
and sometimes
influenza
type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children
aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical
fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system
hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia
Risk groups
The following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia:
babies and very young children

people who smoke
people with other health conditions, such as

people with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as

, having
HIV or AIDS
, having

, or taking medication following an organ transplant
Diagnosing pneumonia
Your GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases.
Pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the
common cold
,
bronchitis
and
asthma
.
To help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you:
whether you feel breathless or you’re breathing faster than usual
how long you’ve had your cough, and whether you’re coughing up mucus and what colour it is
if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out
Your GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.
They may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs.
If you have mild pneumonia, you probably won’t need to have a chest
X-ray
or any other tests.
You may need a chest X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or
blood tests
, if your symptoms haven’t improved within 48 hours of starting treatment.
Treating pneumonia
Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by:
getting plenty of rest
taking
antibiotics
drinking plenty of fluids
If you don’t have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time.
As pneumonia isn’t usually passed from one person to another, it’s safe to be around others, including family members.
However, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.
For at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital.
This is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person’s health and age.

Complications of pneumonia
Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as
diabetes
.
Possible complications of pneumonia include:
pleurisy
– where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure
a lung abscess – a rare complication that’s mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse
blood poisoning (septicaemia)
– also a rare but serious complication
You’ll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications.
Preventing pneumonia
Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren’t passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading.
For example, you should:
cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze
throw away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth
wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects
A healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection.
Find out how to
stop smoking
.
Excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs’ natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia.
People at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine.
Treating pneumonia
Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest, antibiotics and by drinking plenty of fluids. More severe cases may need hospital treatment.
Unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise, you should always finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better.
If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic.
After starting treatment, your symptoms should steadily improve.
However, how quickly they improve will depend on how severe your pneumonia is.
As a general guide, after:
one week – fever should have resolved
four weeks – chest pain and mucus production should have substantially reduced
six weeks – cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced
three months – most symptoms should have resolved, but you may still feel very tired (fatigue)
six months – most people will feel back to normal
Treatment at home
Visit your GP if your symptoms don’t improve within three days of starting
antibiotics
.
Symptoms may not improve if:
the bacteria causing the infection is resistant to antibiotics – your GP may prescribe a different antibiotic, or they may prescribe a second antibiotic for you to take with the first one
a virus is causing the infection, rather than bacteria – antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and your body’s immune system will have to fight the viral infection by creating antibodies
Painkillers, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
, may help relieve pain and reduce fever.
However, you shouldn’t take ibuprofen if you:
are allergic to aspirin or other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
have
asthma
, kidney disease, a history of
stomach ulcers
or
indigestion
Cough medicines
aren’t recommended as there’s also little evidence they are effective. A warm honey and lemon drink can help relieve discomfort caused by coughing.
Your cough may persist for two to three weeks after you finish your course of antibiotics, and you may feel tired for even longer as your body continues to recover.
Drink plenty of fluids to avoid
dehydration
, and get plenty of rest to help your body recover.
If you smoke, it’s more important than ever to stop, as smoking damages your lungs.
Read more about
stop smoking treatments
and
how to stop smoking
.
See your GP if, after following the above self-help measures, your condition is deteriorating or isn’t improving as expected.
Pneumonia isn’t usually passed from one person to another, so it’s safe to be around others, including family members.
However, it’s best for people with a weakened immune system to avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.
Follow-up
Your GP will probably arrange a follow-up appointment for you about six weeks after you start your course of antibiotics.
In some cases, they may arrange follow-up tests, such as a chest
X-ray
, if:
your symptoms haven’t improved
your symptoms have come back
you smoke
you’re over the age of 50
Some people may be advised to have a flu vaccination or pneumococcal vaccination after recovering from pneumonia.
Read more about
preventing pneumonia
.
Treatment in hospital
You may need treatment in hospital if your symptoms are severe. You’ll be given antibiotics and fluids intravenously through a drip, and you may need oxygen to help breathing.
In very serious cases of pneumonia, breathing assistance through a ventilator in an intensive care unit (ICU) may be required.

About psoriatic arthritis
About psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis is a type of
arthritis
that develops in some people with the skin condition
psoriasis
. It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful.
Between 20-40% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis affecting the skin affects around 3% of people.
In most cases, people will experience problems with their skin before they notice any symptoms affecting their joints. In a minority of cases, skin problems may develop after or at the same time as joint problems.
Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. It’s not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don’t.
Signs and symptoms
The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects particular areas including the
hands
feet
knees
elbows
neck and spine
Tendons can also be involved – in some people they may be the major problem.
Symptoms usually develop slowly meaning that many people are unaware that they are developing psoriatic arthritis. In rarer cases, symptoms can develop suddenly and without warning.
The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints.
There may be times when your symptoms improve and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission).
Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they happen.
When to seek medical advice
You should speak to your GP if you experience constant pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints – even if you haven’t been diagnosed with psoriasis.
If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any problems with your joints.
Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis
If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment.
A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis – such as
rheumatoid arthritis
and
osteoarthritis
– have been ruled out.
A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including
blood tests
to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as
X-rays
or scans of your joints.
Treating psoriatic arthritis
The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life.
For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible.
The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Your GP may first prescribe
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.
There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways:
traditional NSAIDs, such as
ibuprofen
, naproxen or diclofenac
COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib
Like all medications, NSAIDs can have side-effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible.
If side-effects do happen, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include
indigestion
and
stomach ulcers
. A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs.
If NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended.
Steroid medication (corticosteroids)
Like NSAIDs,
corticosteroids
can help reduce pain and swelling.
If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months.
Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help when lots of joints are inflamed. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be.
Psoriatic arthritis can be treated with a variety of DMARDs including:
Methotrexate
Sulphasalazine
Leflunomide
Cyclosporin
Antimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine)
Azathioprine
Apremilast
Your rheumatologist will discuss the most appropriate choice of DMARD for you.
It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it’s important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first.
DMARD therapy is monitored according to guidelines such as British Society for Rheumatology (BSR).
Biological treatments
Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if:
your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD
you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD because of other problems e.g. other diseases.
Biological drugs work by directly blocking the chemicals in the blood, skin and joints that switch the immune system on, leading it to attack the lining of your joints and your skin.
Some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on
treating psoriasis
for more information about these medications.  Newer biological drugs include ustekinumab.
The most common side-effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren’t usually serious.
However, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side-effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you’ll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these.
Biological treatments can make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as a
sore throat
, a high temperature (fever), urinary problems or
diarrhoea
.
Biological treatments usually take between 2 and 6 months to take effect.
If it’s effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment.
Complementary therapies
There isn’t enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis.
There is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment.
Complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you’re thinking of using any.
Managing related conditions
As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions – such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
– if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as
heart disease
and
stroke
.
Your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary.
You can also help yourself by:
having a good balance between
rest and regular physical activity
losing weight, if you’re overweight
not smoking
only drinking moderate amounts of
alcohol
Read more about
living with psoriasis
and
preventing CVD
.
Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis.
If psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as:
dents
pits
discolouration
loosening from the nail bed
This is less common if only your skin is affected.
Your care team
As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by:
a specialist nurse – who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team
a dermatologist (skin specialist) – who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms
a physiotherapist – who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile
an occupational therapist – who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these
a psychologist – who can offer psychological support if you need it
a podiatrist who can offer assessment and advice on foot problems if affected during the course of PSA.
Outlook
Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse.
In severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment.
However, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it’s possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints."

Complex PTSD
Self-help guide
Introduction
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.
Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.
They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult.
These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person’s day-to-day life.
Read more about the
symptoms of PTSD
.
Causes of PTSD
The type of events that can cause PTSD include:
serious road accidents
violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery
prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect
witnessing violent deaths
military combat
being held hostage
terrorist attacks
natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis
PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur weeks, months or even years later.
PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it’s not clear exactly why some people develop the condition and others don’t.
Read more about the
causes of PTSD
.
Complex PTSD
People who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex PTSD.
Complex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event. It’s often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life as this can affect a child’s development.
Read more about
complex PTSD
.
When to seek medical advice
It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks.
You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.
If necessary, your GP can refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment.
How PTSD is treated
PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event.
Any treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event. Any of the following treatment options may be recommended:
Watchful waiting – monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment.
Psychotherapy
– such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).
Antidepressants
– such as paroxetine or mirtazapine.
Read more about
treating PTSD
.
Symptoms
The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life.
In most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.
Some people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant, severe symptoms.
The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.
Re-experiencing
Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of:
flashbacks
nightmares
repetitive and distressing images or sensations
physical sensations – such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling
Some people have constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event.
For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.
Avoidance and emotional numbing
Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.
Many people with PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.
Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.
Hyperarousal (feeling ‘on edge’)
Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state of mind is known as hyperarousal.
Hyperarousal often leads to:
irritability
angry outbursts
sleeping problems (
insomnia
)
difficulty concentrating
Other problems
Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:
other mental health problems – such as
depression
, anxiety or
phobias
self-harming or destructive behaviour – such as drug misuse or
alcohol misuse
other physical symptoms – such as
headaches
, dizziness, chest pains and
stomach aches
PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.
PTSD in children
PTSD can affect children as well as adults. Children with PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.
Like adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and
stomach aches
.
However, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as:
bedwetting
being unusually anxious about being separated from a parent or other adult
re-enacting the traumatic event(s) through their play
When to seek medical advice
It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks.
You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.
Your GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They’ll ask whether you’ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you’ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.
Your GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you’d benefit from treatment. See
treating PTSD
for more information.
Causes
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience.
Types of events that can lead to PTSD include:
serious road accidents
violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery
prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect
witnessing violent deaths
military combat
being held hostage
terrorist attacks
natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis
a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition
an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member or friend
PTSD isn’t usually related to situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams.
PTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It isn’t fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don’t. However, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD.
If you’ve had
depression
or anxiety in the past, or you don’t receive much support from family or friends, you’re more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.
There may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.
Possible causes
Although it’s not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. These are described below.
Survival mechanism
One suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive mechanism intended to help you survive further traumatic experiences.
For example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you’re better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being “on edge” (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis.
However, while these responses may be intended to help you survive, they’re actually very unhelpful in reality because you can’t process and move on from the traumatic experience.
Adrenaline levels
Studies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones.
Normally, when in danger, the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction, often known as the “fight or flight” reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain.
People with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there’s no danger. It’s thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD.
Changes in the brain
In people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans.
One part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It’s thought that changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks.
The malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn’t reduce over time.
Treatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.
Treatment
The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychotherapy and medication.
Traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD.
It’s possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it’s never too late to seek help.
Assessment
Before having treatment for PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs.
Your GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you’ll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment if you’ve had symptoms of PTSD for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe.
There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as:
a psychologist – an expert in how the mind works
a community psychiatric nurse – a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare
a psychiatrist – a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions
Watchful waiting
If you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you’ve had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended.
Watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. It’s sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment.
If watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month.
Psychotherapy
If you have PTSD that requires treatment,
psychotherapy
is usually recommended first. A combination of psychotherapy and medication may be recommended if you have severe or persistent PTSD.
Psychotherapy is a type of therapy often used to treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as PTSD,
depression
,
anxiety
and
obsessive compulsive disorder
.
The treatment is carried out by trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help you come up with effective strategies to resolve your problems.
The main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with PTSD are described below.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act.
Trauma-focused CBT uses a range of psychological treatment techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event.
For example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. During this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you feel, while identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience.
Your therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. For example, feeling you’re to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again.
You may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you’ve avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident.
You’ll usually have 8-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes.
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively new treatment which has been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.
It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist’s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. Other methods may include the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone.
It’s not clear exactly how EMDR works but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience.
Group therapy
You may also be offered group therapy as some people find it helpful to speak about their experiences with other people who also have PTSD. Group therapy can be used to teach you ways to manage your symptoms and help you understand the condition.
There are also a number of charities which provide counselling and support groups for PTSD. For example:
Combat Stress
– a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women
Rape Crisis
– a charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault
Victim Support
– providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime
CRUSE
– a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced
bereavement
Medication
Antidepressants
such as paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine are sometimes used to treat PTSD in adults.
Of these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of PTSD. However, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be recommended as well.
However, these medications will only be used if:
you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment
psychological treatment wouldn’t be effective because there’s an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence)
you’ve gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment
you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment
Amitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist.
Antidepressants can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. However, they’re not usually prescribed for people younger than 18 unless recommended by a specialist.
If medication for PTSD is effective, it’s usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. If a medication isn’t effective at reducing your symptoms, your dosage may be increased.
Before prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn.
For example, common side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea.
Possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly.
Children and young people
For children and young people with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended.
This normally involves a course of 8-12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child’s age, circumstances and level of development. Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child’s family.
Treatment with medication isn’t usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD.
Complex PTSD
Complex PTSD may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events, such as violence, neglect or abuse.
Complex PTSD is thought to be more severe if:
the traumatic events happened early in life
the trauma was caused by a parent or carer
the person experienced the trauma for a long time
the person was alone during the trauma
there is still contact with the person responsible for the trauma
As it may take years for the symptoms of complex PTSD to be recognised, a child’s development, including their behaviour and self-confidence, can be altered as they get older.
Adults with complex PTSD may lose their trust in people and feel separated from others.
Symptoms of complex PTSD
The symptoms of complex PTSD are similar to
symptoms of PTSD
but may include:
feelings of shame or guilt
difficulty controlling your emotions
periods of losing attention and concentration – this is known as dissociation
physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches
cutting yourself off from friends and family
relationship difficulties
destructive or risky behaviour – such as self-harm,
alcohol misuse
or drug abuse
suicidal
thoughts
Treating complex PTSD
One of the key symptoms of complex PTSD is losing trust in people. If possible, people with complex PTSD are recommended to slowly start doing regular activities such as:
finding friends
getting a job
regular exercise
taking on hobbies
It’s important to try and develop some feelings of trust. It may take some time, but a trusting relationship with a therapist will help treat complex PTSD.
Treatment from a therapist may be given in three stages, described below.
Stabilisation
One of the first steps in treating complex PTSD may involve speaking with a therapist to learn how to control feelings of distrust and lose the feeling of being ‘disconnected’ from friends and family.
Certain techniques, known as ‘grounding’ techniques, may be able to help you separate an abusive or traumatic past from the present. The aim is to make the past seem less frightening and reduce the amount of flashbacks you experience.
With time, you can begin to experience less anxiety and learn to cope with daily life.
Trauma-focused therapy
Trauma-focused therapy may include:
certain types of
psychotherapy
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)
These treatments may help you to control any distressing thoughts but must be approached carefully to avoid making the situation worse.
Reintegration
The final stage is to begin to use these skills and techniques to develop better relationships with other people.
Medication, such as
antidepressants
, may still be recommended if psychotherapy isn’t possible or you feel unsafe.

the Royal College of Psychiatrists website

Self-help guide
If you think you’re experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), it’s important for you to visit your GP and discuss your concerns. The PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide can help with managing symptoms while you wait for an assessment by your GP or a mental health professional.
This guide aims to help you:
consider whether you’re experiencing symptoms of PTSD or CPTSD
understand more about PTSD and CPTSD
think about ways to manage or recover from PTSD or CPTSD
The PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide is based on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CT). TF-CT aims to help people who have been through trauma and adversity to make sense of what they’ve experienced, and become less distressed and affected by it.

Personality disorders are conditions where an individual differs significantly from an average person. This may be related to how they:
think
perceive
feel
relate to others
Changes in how a person feels and distorted beliefs about other people can lead to odd behaviour. This can be distressing and may upset others.
Common features of a personality disorder
Common features of a personality disorder include:
being overwhelmed by negative feelings like distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger
avoiding other people
feeling empty and emotionally disconnected
odd behaviour
difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships, especially with partners, children and professional carers
periods of losing contact with reality
Some people may also have difficulty managing negative feelings without self-harming. This can include abusing drugs and alcohol or taking overdoses. In rare cases, it may include threatening other people.
People with personality disorders often experience other mental health problems. This includes
depression
and
substance misuse.
Symptoms typically get worse with
stress
.
When and why personality disorders occur
Personality disorders are common mental health problems.
They usually emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood. They may be mild, moderate or severe. People may have periods of “remission” where they function well.
Personality disorders may be associated with genetic and family factors. Experiences of distress or fear during childhood, like neglect or abuse, are common.
Many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). People with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer.
Types of personality disorder
There are different types of personality disorders.
Paranoid personality disorder
A person with a paranoid personality disorder is extremely distrustful and suspicious. Other features include:
thinking other people are lying to them or trying to manipulate them
feeling they cannot trust their friends and associates
worrying that any confidential information shared with others will be used against them
thinking there are hidden meanings in remarks most would regard as innocent
worrying that their spouse or partner is unfaithful, despite a lack of evidence
Schizoid personality disorder
Someone with a schizoid personality disorder may appear cold and detached. They may also avoid making close social contact with others. Other features include:
preferring to take part in activities that do not need interaction with others
having little desire to form close relationships, including sexual relationships
being uninterested when receiving criticism or praise
having a limited ability to experience pleasure or joy
Schizotypal personality disorder
A person with a schizotypal personality disorder is likely to:
have poor social skills
have delusional thoughts
behave in unusual ways
Other features include:
believing in special powers – like telepathy or the ability to influence other people’s emotions and actions
having unusual ways of speaking – like long, rambling vague sentences or going off on a tangent
experiencing excessive anxiety in social situations – even if they’ve known a particular person or group of people for a long time
A person may also attach undue and misguided significance to everyday events. For example, thinking newspaper headlines are secret messages to them.
Antisocial personality disorder
A person with an antisocial personality disorder sees other people as vulnerable. This means they may intimidate or bully others without remorse.
Symptoms include:
lack of concern, regret or remorse about other people’s distress
irresponsibility and disregard for normal social behaviour
difficulty in sustaining long-term relationships
little ability to tolerate frustration and control their anger
lack of guilt, or not learning from their mistakes
blaming others for problems in their lives
Borderline personality disorder
A person with borderline personality disorder:
is emotionally unstable
has impulses to self-harm
has very intense and unstable relationships with others
Histrionic personality disorder
A person with a histrionic personality disorder is anxious about being ignored. As a result, they feel an overwhelming urge to be noticed. They also have the urge to be the centre of everyone’s attention.
Features include:
displaying excessive emotion, yet appearing to lack real emotional sincerity
dressing provocatively and engaging in inappropriate flirting or sexually seductive behaviour
moving quickly from one emotional state to another
being self-centred and caring little about other people
constantly seeking reassurance and approval from other people
Symptoms and signs may co-exist with borderline and narcissistic personality disorders.
Narcissistic personality disorder
A person with narcissistic personality disorder swings between:
seeing themselves as special, and
fearing they’re worthless
They may act as if they have an inflated sense of their own importance. They may also show an intense need for other people to look up to them.
Other symptoms include:
exaggerating their achievements and abilities
thinking they’re entitled to be treated better than other people
exploiting other people for their own personal gain
lacking empathy for other people’s weaknesses
looking down on people they feel are “beneath” them
feeling deeply envious of people they see as being “above” them
Avoidant personality disorder
A person with avoidant personality disorder:
appears painfully shy
is socially inhibited
feels inadequate
is extremely sensitive to rejection
Unlike people with schizoid personality disorders, they desire close relationships with others. However, they lack the confidence and ability to form them.
Dependent personality disorder
A person with dependent personality disorder feels they can’t be independent. They may show an excessive need for others to look after them and are “clingy”. Other features include:
finding it difficult to make decisions without other people’s guidance
needing others to take responsibility over what should be their own life choices
not being able to express disagreement with other people
finding it difficult to start new activities due to a lack of confidence
going to extremes to get support and comfort
feeling helpless and uncomfortable when alone
urgently needing to start a new relationship when one comes to an end
having an unrealistic and constant fear they’ll be left alone to fend for themselves
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder
A person with obsessive compulsive personality disorder is:
anxious about issues that seem out of control or “messy”
preoccupied with orderliness and ways to control their environment
They may come across to others as a “control freak”.
Other features include:
having an excessive interest in lists, timetables and rules
perfectionism – being so focused on completing a task perfectly that they struggle to finish it
being a workaholic
having very rigid views about issues like morality, ethics and how a person should behave
hoarding items that seem to have no monetary or sentimental value
being unable to delegate tasks to other people
disliking spending money, as they think it’s always better to save for a “rainy day”
Differences to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
This personality disorder differs from
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
.
People with OCD are aware that their behaviour is abnormal and are anxious about it. Whereas, most people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder think their behaviour is acceptable. They usually have no desire to change it.
Some people with OCD feel the need to carry out rituals. For example, having to touch every second lamppost as they walk down the street. This is not usually the case with people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
People with OCD may feel the need to make lists or organise items in their house, but feel anxious about doing so. People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder feel less anxiety through such tasks. They may become irritated when prevented from doing so.
Treating a personality disorder
Many people recover from personality disorders over time.
Treatment usually involves a course of psychological therapy tailored to the individual. This treatment usually lasts at least 6 months. But, it may last longer depending on the severity of the condition and other problems.
Psychological therapies
Psychotherapy
involves discussing thoughts, emotions and behaviours with a trained professional. The aim is to improve people’s ability to regulate their thoughts and emotions.
Some therapies focus on dysfunctional thoughts. Others focus on self-reflection and being aware of how your mind works. Some therapies, especially group therapies, help people understand social relationships better.
Psychological therapies can be effective for many personality disorders. But, they should only be delivered by a trained professional. They should have experience working with personality disorders and other conditions. This is because personality disorders can be associated with high-risk behaviours, like self-harm.
The psychotherapist will listen and discuss important issues with you. They can also suggest strategies to resolve problems. If necessary, they’ll help you change your attitudes and behaviour.
A range of different psychotherapies are used to treat personality disorders.

Medication
No medications are currently licensed for the treatment of any personality disorder. But, medications may be prescribed to treat associated problems, like:
depression
anxiety
psychotic symptoms"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/rare-tumours/,"Rare tumours
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Types of rare cancers in children
Rare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as:
rare cancers that only affect children, such as pancreatoblastoma, malignant rhabdoid tumours and melanotic neuroectodermal tumours of infancy
cancers that usually only affect adults, such as cancers of the digestive system, the thyroid and the adrenal gland
rare cancers in the head and neck area, such as nasopharyngeal cancer
rare hormonal/endocrine cancers, such as phaeochromocytoma
rare brain tumours, such as meningioma
rare skin cancers, such as melanomas
Causes
The causes of most rare childhood cancers are unknown. But if other family members have had particular types of cancer, this may sometimes suggest that there is an inherited faulty gene in the family. If this is a possibility, your child’s specialist will talk to you about it.
Treatment
Rare cancers are treated with the same treatments used for other childhood cancers. This includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Your child may need a combination of these treatments.
Surgery
Usually an operation is done to remove all or as much of the cancer as possible. Other treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, may be given after or sometimes before surgery. They may also be used if an operation is not possible.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be used to treat any cancer cells that may be left behind after surgery, or to shrink a cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. Chemotherapy may be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back or to treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
Research
Clinical trials are usually not available as the number of children with rare cancers is so small. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) aims to improve the care and treatment of children with cancer and it develops guidelines on the best ways of treating and managing those with rare tumours. Doctors communicate with specialist colleagues in other countries to promote research in rare tumours and develop new forms of treatment.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/,"Postnatal depression
Postnatal depression is a type of depression. Many parents experience it after having a baby.
It’s a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 mothers within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common.
With the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most people make a full recovery.
Symptoms of postnatal depression
Postnatal depression affects everyone differently. It can start at any point in the first year after giving birth. It can continue from depression in pregnancy. It may develop suddenly or gradually.
Many people feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the ‘baby blues’ and is so common that it’s considered normal. The baby blues don’t last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth.
If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression.
The main symptoms of postnatal depression include:
a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood
loss of interest in the world around you
no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure
lack of energy and feeling tired all the time
trouble sleeping at night
feeling sleepy during the day
feeling that you’re unable to look after your baby
problems concentrating and making decisions
loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating)
feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ‘can’t be bothered’)
feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame
difficulty bonding with your baby – feeling of indifference and no sense of enjoyment in their company
frightening thoughts, for example, about hurting your baby – these can be scary, but they’re very rarely acted upon
thinking about suicide and self-harm
These symptoms can affect your day-to-day life and your relationships with your baby, family and friends.
Speak to your GP or health visitor as soon as possible if:
you think you have postnatal depression
Don’t struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away. It can take a lot longer to feel better if it’s not addressed.
Spotting the signs of postnatal depression
Postnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they’re feeling. This may be because they worry they’ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.
Signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include:
frequently crying for no obvious reason
having difficulty bonding with their baby
getting no pleasure from playing with them or feeling no good as a parent
withdrawing from contact with other people
speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they’re hopeless
neglecting themselves, like not washing or changing their clothes
losing all sense of time, like being unaware whether 10 minutes or 2 hours have passed
losing their sense of humour
constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance from others
If you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings. This could be to talk to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor.
Causes of postnatal depression
The cause of postnatal depression isn’t completely clear. Some of the factors it has been associated with include:
a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life or during pregnancy
having no close family or friends to support you
a poor relationship with your partner
recent stressful life events, like a bereavement
experiencing the ‘baby blues’
Even if you don’t have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression.
It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting.
Treating postnatal depression
Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening. But, support and treatments are available. With the right treatment and support, most people make a full recovery, although it can take time.
Talk to your GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what’s best for you.
Your GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For example, you may be anaemic after giving birth. This could add to any feelings of depression you might have.
Psychological treatments for postnatal depression
Psychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for postnatal depression.
Guided self-help
Guided self-help involves working through a book or an online course. You can do this on your own or with some help from a therapist.
It focusses on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them.
The courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks.
Cognitive behavioural therapy
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy. It’s based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour.
CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way.
CBT can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last 3 to 4 months.
Interpersonal therapy
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you’re experiencing.
It aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners. It then looks at how they might relate to your feelings of depression.
Treatment also usually lasts 3 to 4 months.
Antidepressants
Antidepressants
may be recommended if:
you have moderate or severe depression
you don’t want to try psychological treatment
psychological treatment doesn’t help
you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression
They can help ease symptoms like:
low mood
irritability
lack of concentration
sleeplessness
This helps you to function normally and helps you cope better with your new baby.
Antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt. This means it’s important to keep taking them even if you don’t notice an improvement straight away. You’ll usually need to take them for around 6 months after you begin to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return.
If you’re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines. Some types of antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding.
Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants. You should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby.
Self-help
There are many things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope.
Do
talk to your partner, friends and family to help them understand how you’re feeling
talk to your loved ones about what they can do to support you
accept help from others when it’s offered
ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks like housework, cooking and shopping
make time for yourself – try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable
rest when you can – although it can be difficult when you’re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance
follow
good sleeping habits
ask your partner to help with the night-time work
exercise regularly – this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression
eat regular,
healthy meals
Don’t
do not go for long periods without eating
do not drink alcohol or take drugs, as this can make you feel worse
Support groups
Ask your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other people who are going through something similar.
Find postnatal depression support and information in your area
Treatments for severe postnatal depression
You might be referred to a
specialist perinatal mental health team
if your depression:
is very severe
doesn’t respond to treatment like antidepressants, self-help or therapy
Your team might be able to offer other treatments, like:
more intensive CBT
other psychological treatments, like
psychotherapy
therapies such as baby massage which can improve depression and help build your relationships with your baby
different medications
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through the brain
For a small number of people, coming into hospital can help speed up recovery.
You may be offered a place in a
Mother and Baby Unit
, where you can continue to look after your baby while you get the best treatment for your illness."

About psoriasis
Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.
These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore.
Psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally.
The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it’s just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a major impact on their quality of life.
Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.

Why it happens
People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells.
Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.
Although the process isn’t fully understood, it’s thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system is your body’s defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.
Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.
Many people’s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a “trigger”. Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.
The condition isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person.
Read more about the
causes of psoriasis
.
How psoriasis is diagnosed
A GP can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.
In rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a
biopsy
, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis,
lichen planus
, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea.
You may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.
If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken.
Treating psoriasis
There’s no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.
In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or
topical corticosteroids
. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.
If these aren’t effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.
In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body.

Living with psoriasis
Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.
For example, some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It’s also quite common to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.
Speak to your GP or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as
The Psoriasis Association
, where you can speak to other people with the condition.

Symptoms of psoriasis
Psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.
There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.
Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.
You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.
Psoriasis often occurs on the elbow area.

Common types of psoriasis
Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)
This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.
Scalp psoriasis
This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.
Nail psoriasis
In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble.
Guttate psoriasis
Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There’s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.
This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.
Inverse (flexural) psoriasis
This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.
Pustular psoriasis
Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.
Generalised pustular psoriasis or von Zumbusch psoriasis
This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.
Palmoplantar pustular psoriasis
This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.
Acropustulosis
This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities.
Erythrodermic psoriasis
Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection,
dehydration
,
heart failure
, hypothermia and
malnutrition
.
Causes of psoriasis
Psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It’s not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it’s caused by a problem with the immune system.
Your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3 to 4 weeks.
In people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3 to 7 days. As a result, cells that aren’t fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales.
Problems with the immune system
Your immune system is your body’s defence against disease and it helps fight infection. One of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a T-cell.
T-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. This causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more T-cells.
It’s not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may play a role.
Genetics
Psoriasis runs in families. 1 in 3 people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition.
However, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. It’s likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop it.
Psoriasis triggers
Many people’s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Knowing your triggers may help you to avoid a flare-up. Common triggers include:
an injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the Koebner response)
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
smoking
stress
hormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during puberty and the
menopause
)
certain medicines such as lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines including
ibuprofen
, ACE inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) and
beta blockers
(used to treat congestive heart failure)
throat infections – in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don’t develop psoriasis)
other immune disorders, such as
HIV
, which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first time
Psoriasis isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person.
Treating psoriasis
Treatment overview
Treatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. Your doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary.
A wide range of treatments are available for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. Talk to your doctor if you feel a treatment isn’t working or you have uncomfortable side effects.
Treatments fall into 3 categories:
topical – creams and ointments that are applied to your skin
phototherapy – your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet light
systemic– oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body
Often, different types of treatment are used in combination.
Your treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. You may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional) as this can help you manage your day-to-day health.
The various treatments for psoriasis are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options.
Topical treatments
Topical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate psoriasis. These are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas.
Some people find that topical treatments are all they need to control their condition, although it may take up to 6 weeks before there’s a noticeable effect.
If you have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended.
Emollients
Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. If you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your GP will suggest.
The main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. Some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. It’s important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient.
Emollients are available as a wide variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor.
Steroid creams or ointments
Steroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids)
are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in most areas of the body. The treatment works by reducing inflammation. This slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching.
Topical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. Only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. Stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of skin or on particularly thick patches. Overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning.
Vitamin D analogues
Vitamin D analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of steroid creams for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. They work by slowing the production of skin cells. They also have an anti-inflammatory effect.
Examples of vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. There are very few side effects, as long as you don’t use more than the recommended amount.
Calcineurin inhibitors
Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. They’re sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if steroid creams aren’t effective.
These medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they’re started, but this usually improves within a week.
Coal tar
Coal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. How it works isn’t exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. It may be used to treat psoriasis affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren’t effective.
Coal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. It can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).
Dithranol
Dithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. However, it can burn if too concentrated.
It’s typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. It’s applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10 to 60 minutes before being washed off.
Dithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).
Phototherapy
Phototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. Artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. These treatments aren’t the same as using a sunbed.
UVB phototherapy
Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. The light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven’t responded to topical treatments. Each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2 or 3 times a week for 6 to 8 weeks.
Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)
For this treatment, you’ll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. This makes your skin more sensitive to light. Your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet A (UVA). This light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet B light.
This treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatment. Side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. You may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. Long-term use of this treatment isn’t encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer.
Combination light therapy
Combining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. Some doctors use UVB phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. Combining UVB phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as Ingram treatment).
Systemic treatments
If your psoriasis is severe or other treatments haven’t worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. Systemic treatments are treatments that work throughout the entire body.
These medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. All the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. Before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them.
There are 2 main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). These are described in more detail below.
Non-biological medications
Methotrexate
Methotrexate can help to control psoriasis by slowing down the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It’s usually taken once a week.
Methotrexate can cause nausea and may affect the production of blood cells. Long-term use can cause liver damage. People who have liver disease shouldn’t take methotrexate, and you shouldn’t drink alcohol when taking it.
Methotrexate can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug and for 3 months after they stop. Methotrexate can also affect the development of sperm cells, so men shouldn’t father a child during treatment and for 3 weeks afterwards.
Ciclosporin
Ciclosporin is a medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressant). It was originally used to prevent transplant rejection, but has proved effective in treating all types of psoriasis. It’s usually taken daily.
Ciclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored.
Acitretin
Acitretin is an oral retinoid that reduces the production of skin cells. It’s used to treat severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other non-biological systemic treatments. It’s usually taken daily.
Acitretin has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages and, in rarer cases,
hepatitis
.
Acitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2 years after they stop taking it. However, it’s safe for a man taking acitretin to father a baby.
Biological treatments
Biological treatments reduce inflammation by targeting overactive cells in the immune system. These treatments are usually used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatments, or if you can’t use other treatments.
Etanercept
Etanercept is injected twice a week and you’ll be shown how to do this. If there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 12 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.
The main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. However, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. If you had
tuberculosis
in the past, there’s a risk it may return. You’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.
Adalimumab
Adalimumab is injected once every 2 weeks and you’ll be shown how to do this. If there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.
Adalimumab can be harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 5 months after the treatment finishes.
The main side effects of adalimumab include headaches, a rash at the injection site and nausea. However, as adalimumab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.
Infliximab
Infliximab is given as a drip (infusion) into your vein at the hospital. You’ll have 3 infusions in the first 6 weeks, then 1 infusion every 8 weeks. If there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 10 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.
The main side effect of infliximab is a headache. However, as infliximab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.
Ustekinumab
Ustekinumab is injected at the beginning of treatment, then again 4 weeks later. After this, injections are every 12 weeks. If there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.
The main side effects of ustekinumab are a throat infection and a rash at the injection site. However, as ustekinumab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.
Living with psoriasis
Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.
If you have psoriasis, you may find the following advice helpful.
Self care
Self care is an essential part of your daily life. It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. Self care includes staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health, preventing illness or accidents, and caring more effectively for minor illnesses and long-term conditions.
People with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from self care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Having a
care plan
will help you manage your treatment so that it fits your lifestyle.
Keep up your treatment
It’s important to use your treatment as prescribed, even if your psoriasis improves. Continuous treatment can help to prevent flare-ups. If you have any questions or concerns about your treatment or any side effects, talk to your GP or healthcare team.
Regular reviews
Because psoriasis is usually a long-term condition, you may be in regular contact with your healthcare team. Discuss your symptoms or concerns with them, as the more the team knows, the more they can help you.
Healthy eating and exercise
People with psoriasis have a slightly higher risk of developing
diabetes
and
cardiovascular disease
than the general population, although it’s not known why. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with psoriasis, because they can help to prevent many health problems.
Eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly can also relieve stress, which may improve your psoriasis.
Emotional impact of psoriasis
Because of the effect that psoriasis can have on physical appearance, low self-esteem and anxiety are common among people with the condition. This can lead to
depression
, especially if the psoriasis gets worse.
Your GP or dermatologist will understand the psychological and emotional impact of psoriasis, so talk to them about your concerns or anxieties.
Psoriatic arthritis
Some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. This causes tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue, as well as stiffness. It commonly affects the ends of the fingers and toes. In some people, it affects the lower back, neck and knees. Most people develop psoriatic arthritis after psoriasis, but about 20% develop it before they’re diagnosed with psoriasis.
There’s no single test for psoriatic arthritis. It’s normally diagnosed using a combination of methods, including looking at your medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays and MRI scans. If you have psoriasis, you’ll usually have an annual assessment to look for signs of psoriatic arthritis.
If your doctor thinks you have psoriatic arthritis, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist, so you can be treated with anti-inflammatory or anti-rheumatic medicines.
Pregnancy
Psoriasis doesn’t affect fertility, and women with psoriasis can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. Some women find their psoriasis improves during pregnancy, but for others it gets worse.
Talk to your healthcare team if you’re thinking of having a baby. Some treatments for psoriasis can be harmful to a developing baby, so use contraception while taking them. This can apply to both men and women, depending on the medication. Your healthcare team can suggest the best ways to control your psoriasis before you start trying for a family.
Talk to others
Many people with psoriasis have found that getting involved in support groups helps them. Support groups can increase your self-confidence, reduce feelings of isolation, and give you practical advice about living with the condition.

Introduction
Symptoms
Causes
Diagnosis
Treatment
Complications
Introduction
Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions.
The two main
symptoms of psychosis
are:
hallucinations – where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren’t there; a common hallucination is hearing voices
delusions – where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue – for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you
The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour.
Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode.
What causes psychosis?
Psychosis isn’t a condition in itself – it’s triggered by other conditions.
It’s sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as:
schizophrenia
– a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions
bipolar disorder
– a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of
depression
(lows) and mania (highs)
severe depression – some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they’re very depressed
Psychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as
Parkinson’s disease
, a
brain tumour
, or as a result of drug misuse or
alcohol misuse
.
How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause.
For example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur.
Read more about the
causes of psychosis
.
Diagnosing psychosis
You should see your GP immediately if you’re experiencing psychotic episodes. It’s important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes.
Your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what’s causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you:
whether you’re taking any medication
whether you’ve been taking illegal substances
how your mood has been – for example, whether you’ve been depressed
how you’ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you’re still working
whether you have a family history of mental health conditions – such as schizophrenia
about your hallucinations – such as whether you’ve heard voices
about your delusions – such as whether you feel people are controlling you
whether you have any other symptoms
Your GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.

Treating psychosis
Treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of:
antipsychotic medication – which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis
psychological therapies – the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia; in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis
social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation
Most people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring.
If a person’s psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
Read more about the
treatment of psychosis
.
Getting help for others
People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They’re unaware that they’re thinking and acting strangely.
Because of their lack of insight, it’s often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them.
If you’re concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they’ve previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person’s symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can:
take them to the nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree
call their GP or local out-of-hours GP
call 999 and ask for an ambulance
Complications
People with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both.
This may be because these substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term.
People with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of
suicide
. It’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.
Side effects can also occur if someone is taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases, a person with psychosis may also develop
type 2 diabetes
.
Read more about the
complications of psychosis
.
Symptoms
Someone who develops psychosis will have their own unique set of symptoms and experiences, according to their particular circumstances.
However, four main symptoms are associated with a psychotic episode. They are:
hallucinations
delusions
confused and disturbed thoughts
lack of insight and self-awareness
These are outlined in more detail below.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are where a person perceives something that doesn’t exist in reality. They can occur in all five of the senses:
sight – someone with psychosis may see colours and shapes, or people or animals that aren’t there
sounds – someone with psychosis may hear voices that are angry, unpleasant or sarcastic
touch – a common psychotic hallucination is that you are being touched when there is nobody there
smell – usually a strange or unpleasant odour
taste – some people with psychosis have complained of having a constant unpleasant taste in their mouth
Delusions
A delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something implausible, bizarre, or obviously untrue. Paranoid delusion and delusions of grandeur are two examples of psychotic delusions.
A person with psychosis will often believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. This can lead to unusual behaviour. For example, a person with psychosis may refuse to be in the same room as a mobile phone because they believe they are mind control devices.
Someone with psychosis may also have delusions of grandeur. This is where they believe they have some imaginary power or authority. For example, they may think they’re the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead.
Confused and disturbed thoughts
People with psychosis often have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. Signs of this include:
rapid and constant speech
random speech – for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence
a sudden loss in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activity
Lack of insight
People who have psychotic episodes are often totally unaware their behaviour is in any way strange or that their delusions or hallucinations are not real.
They may recognise delusional or bizarre behaviour in others, but lack the self-awareness to recognise it in themselves.
For example, a person with psychosis being treated in a psychiatric ward may complain that their fellow patients are mentally unwell, while they’re perfectly normal.
Postnatal psychosis
Postnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form of
postnatal depression
, a type of depression some women experience after having a baby.
It’s estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. It most commonly occurs during the first few weeks after having a baby.
Postnatal psychosis is more likely to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such as
bipolar disorder
or
schizophrenia
.
As well as the symptoms of psychosis, symptoms of postnatal psychosis can also include:
a high mood (mania) – for example, talking and thinking too much or too quickly
a low mood – for example,
depression
, lack of energy, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping
Postnatal psychosis is regarded as a medical emergency. Contact your GP immediately if you think someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis. If this isn’t possible, call the NHS 24 ‘111’ service or your local out-of-hours service.
If you think there’s an imminent danger of harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Causes
The causes of psychosis have three main classifications.
They are psychosis caused by:
mental (psychological) conditions
general medical conditions
substances, such as alcohol or drugs
The three classifications are described in more detail below.
Psychological causes
The following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people:
schizophrenia
– a long-term (chronic) mental health condition that causes hallucinations and delusions
bipolar disorder
– a condition that affects a person’s moods, which can swing from one extreme to another (highs and lows)
severe
stress
or
anxiety
severe
depression
– feelings of persistent sadness that last for more than six weeks, including
postnatal depression
, which some women experience after having a baby
lack of sleep
The underlying psychological cause will often influence the type of psychotic episode someone experiences.
For example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have delusions of grandeur, whereas someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to develop
paranoid delusions
.
General medical conditions
The following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people:
HIV and AIDS
– a virus that attacks the body’s natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system)
malaria
– a tropical disease spread by infected mosquitoes
syphilis – a bacterial infection usually passed on through sexual contact
Alzheimer’s disease
– the most common form of dementia, which causes a decline in mental abilities like memory and reasoning
Parkinson’s disease
– a long-term condition that affects the way the brain co-ordinates body movements, including walking, talking, and writing
hypoglycaemia
– an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in the blood
lupus
– a condition where the immune system attacks healthy tissue
Lyme disease
– a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks
multiple sclerosis
– a condition that affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing problems with muscle movement, balance, and vision
brain tumour
– a growth of cells in the brain that multiply in an abnormal and uncontrollable way
Substances
Alcohol misuse
and drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode.
A person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking alcohol or taking drugs after using them for a long time. This is known as withdrawal.
It’s also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you’re high on drugs.
Drugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include:
cocaine
amphetamine (speed)
methamphetamine (crystal meth)
mephedrone (MCAT or miaow)
MDMA (ecstasy)
cannabis
LSD (acid)
psilocybins (magic mushrooms)
ketamine
In rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medication or as a result of an overdose of that medication.
For example, levodopa, a medication used to treat
Parkinson’s disease
, can sometimes cause psychotic episodes. However, any medicine that acts on the brain can cause psychosis with an overdose.
Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.
See your GP if you’re experiencing psychotic side effects caused by medication.
The brain
There’s been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can trigger
symptoms of psychosis
.
Grey matter
Research has revealed several physical and biological changes occur in the brain during a psychotic episode. Grey matter is the part of the brain responsible for processing thoughts.
The results of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
have shown some people with a history of psychosis have less grey matter than most other people. However, it’s not yet fully understood why this is.
Dopamine
Researchers also believe dopamine plays an important role in psychosis.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, one of many chemicals the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. It is associated with how we feel whether something is significant, important, or interesting.
It’s thought levels of dopamine in the brain become too high in people with psychosis. The excess dopamine interrupts specific pathways in the brain that are responsible for some of its most important functions, such as:
memory
emotion
social behaviour
self-awareness
Disruption to these important brain functions may explain the symptoms of psychosis.
Evidence for the role of dopamine in psychosis comes from several sources, including brain scans and the fact medications known to reduce the effects of dopamine in the brain also reduce the symptoms of psychosis.
However, illegal drugs known to increase levels of dopamine in the brain – such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines – can trigger psychosis.
Diagnosis
You should visit your GP if you’re experiencing psychotic episodes.
It’s important to speak to your GP as soon as possible as the early treatment of psychosis usually has better long-term outcomes.
Initial assessment
There’s no test to positively diagnose psychosis. However, your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse.
Your GP may ask questions to determine the cause of your psychosis. For example, they may ask you:
whether you’re taking any medication
whether you’ve been taking illegal substances
how your moods have been – for example, whether you’ve been depressed
how you’ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you’re still working
whether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such as
schizophrenia
about the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you’ve heard voices
about the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you
about any other symptoms you have
Referral
The evidence supporting the early treatment of psychosis means you’re likely to be referred to a specialist urgently. This will either be during or after your first episode of psychosis.
Who you’re referred to will depend on the services available in your area. You may be referred to:
a community mental health team – a team of different mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions
a crisis resolution team – a team of different mental health professionals who treat people currently experiencing a psychotic episode who would otherwise require hospitalisation
an early intervention team – a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis
These teams are likely to include some or all of the following healthcare professionals:
a psychologist – a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions
a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor who has received further training in treating mental health conditions
a community mental health nurse – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions
Your psychiatrist will carry out a full assessment to help identify and diagnose any underlying mental health condition that could be causing your symptoms. This will help when planning your
treatment for psychosis
.
Helping others
The lack of insight associated with psychosis means people experiencing it aren’t always able to recognise their strange behaviour.
They may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there’s nothing wrong with them, and you may need to get help for them.
Someone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a mental health worker, who works in social services, so try to contact them to express your concerns.
Someone who is having a psychotic episode for the first time may need a friend, relative or someone else close to them to persuade them to visit their GP.
If they’re having a psychotic episode that’s rapidly getting worse, you should contact their crisis team or, if the team isn’t available, the duty psychiatrist at their nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.
If a person who is having a psychotic episode refuses to seek help and is believed to present a risk to themselves or others, their nearest relative can request a psychological assessment. Your
local mental health trust
can advise you about this.
If someone has very severe psychosis, they can be compulsorily detained at hospital for assessment and treatment under the
Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015
.
Treatment
Treatment for psychosis involves a combination of antipsychotic medicines, psychological therapies, and social support.
Your care team
Your treatment is likely to be co-ordinated by a team of mental health professionals working together. If this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team.
Early intervention teams
An early intervention team is a team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis.
Some early intervention teams only focus on a certain age range, such as people who are 14 to 35 years old.
Depending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide:
a full assessment of your symptoms
prescriptions for medications
psychological services
social, occupational, and educational interventions
Treatment for psychosis will vary, depending on the underlying cause. You’ll receive specific treatment if you’ve been diagnosed with an underlying mental health condition as well.
For example,
treatment for bipolar disorder
uses a variety of medications, which could include antipsychotics to treat symptoms of mania, lithium and anticonvulsants to help stabilise mood, as well as psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Treatment for schizophrenia usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medication and social support. CBT or another type of
psychotherapy
called family therapy are also often used.
Psychosis related to drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal may only require a short course of antipsychotics or tranquillisers, which have a calming effect. Referral to an addiction counsellor may then be recommended.
Antipsychotics
Antipsychotic medicines, also known as neuroleptics, are usually recommended as the first treatment for psychosis. They work by blocking the effect of dopamine, a chemical that transmits messages in the brain.
However, they’re not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. In particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also have
epilepsy
, a condition that causes seizures or fits.
People who have
cardiovascular disease
– conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such as
heart disease
– will also be closely monitored.
Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but they may take several days or weeks to reduce other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.
Antipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. There are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need one injection every two to six weeks.
Depending on the underlying cause of your psychosis, you may only need to take antipsychotics until your psychosis subsides.
However, if you have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, you may need to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis to prevent further episodes of psychosis.
Side effects
Antipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person.
Side effects can include:
drowsiness – this may affect your ability to drive
shaking and trembling
restlessness
muscle twitches and spasms – where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully
blurred vision
dizziness
constipation
loss of sex drive (libido)
dry mouth
See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. In addition, long-term use of antipsychotics can lead to complications like weight gain and
diabetes
.
Read more about the
complications of psychosis
.
Tell your GP if you have side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. There may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take.
Never stop taking medication prescribed for you unless advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.
Suddenly stopping prescription medication could trigger a return of your symptoms (relapse). When it’s time for you to stop taking your medication, it will be done gradually and under close observation.
Psychological treatment
Psychological treatment can help reduce the intensity and anxiety caused by psychosis. Some possible psychological treatments are discussed below.
Cognitive behavioural therapy
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them.
The aim of CBT is to identify unhelpful thinking patterns and emotions that may be causing your unwanted feelings and behaviours. It’s then possible to learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and balanced thoughts.
A CBT therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what’s happening to you. The aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work or university, or regaining a sense of control.
Family therapy
Family therapy is known to be an effective form of treatment for people with psychosis. It’s a way of helping both you and your family cope with your condition.
After having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for care and support. While most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family.
Family therapy involves a series of informal meetings that take place over a period of six months. Meetings may include:
discussing your condition and how it might progress, plus the available treatments
exploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis
deciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as planning how to manage future psychotic episodes
Self-help groups
If you’re experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who’ve had similar experiences.
Complications
Someone experiencing a psychotic episode may self-harm. Suicidal thoughts and an increased risk of suicide are also common.
Self-harm
Self-harming behaviour is a relatively common complication in people with psychosis. A study found 1 in 10 people with psychosis also had a history of self-harm.
The risk of self-harm is thought to be highest in people who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis but aren’t receiving treatment.
See your GP if you’re self-harming. You can also call the
Samaritans
on 08457 90 90 90 for support.
If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs of unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on the wrists, arms, thighs, and chest. People who self-harm may keep themselves covered up at all times, even in hot weather.
A person who’s self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or they may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. It’s important to approach them with care and understanding.
They may not want to discuss their self-harming behaviour with you, but you could suggest they speak to their GP or a counsellor on a support helpline.
Suicide
People with psychosis also have an increased risk of
suicide
. It’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.
If you’re feeling suicidal, you can:
call the
Samaritans
support service on 08457 90 90 90
go to
your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department
and tell the staff how you’re feeling
contact the NHS 24 ‘111’ service
speak to a friend, family member, or someone you trust
make an urgent appointment to see your GP, psychiatrist, or care team
Read more about
getting help if you’re feeling suicidal
.
If you’re worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, recommend that they contact one or more of the organisations above and encourage them, in a non-judgemental way, to talk about how they’re feeling.
If the person has previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as
depression
, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice.

Antipsychotics
Using antipsychotics on a medium- to long-term basis can cause a number of complications. Some of the more common complications are discussed below.
Weight gain
Weight gain is a complication of many commonly used antipsychotics. There are two main reasons why weight gain is thought to occur.
Antipsychotics can:
lead to an increase in appetite
make you less active
You’ll probably be advised to take more exercise to help burn off the excess fat.
Read about
getting started with exercise
and
how to lose weight safely
.
Metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome is a term describing a number of related conditions linked to weight gain, such as:
high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)
high cholesterol
high blood pressure (hypertension)
obesity
These health conditions can also increase your risk of developing
type 2 diabetes
,
heart disease
and, most seriously,
heart attack
or
stroke
.
Because of the risk of metabolic syndrome, you’ll usually need to have regular
blood tests
and blood pressure tests while taking antipsychotics.
If your test results show you have an increased risk of developing a condition such as heart disease, a number of preventative treatments, such as
statins
, are available to help lower cholesterol levels.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD)
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is another common complication of long-term antipsychotic use.
TD is a movement disorder where a person experiences involuntary movements, such as twitching, tics, grimaces, tremors, and spasms. It usually starts in the face and mouth before spreading to the rest of the body.
In some cases, stopping taking an antipsychotic will provide relief from TD symptoms, but in other cases it makes the symptoms worse.
However, stopping medication isn’t always safe and has to be balanced against the risk of having a relapse.
In some cases, TD can be a permanent condition.
There are also a number of treatments that can sometimes improve the symptoms of TD, including:
clonazepam – a medication used to treat
epilepsy
, a condition that affects the brain and causes seizures or fits
vitamin E supplements – check with the doctor in charge of your care before taking vitamin supplements as they’re not safe or suitable for everyone"

Pubic lice, also known as crabs, are tiny insects that live on coarse human body hair, such as pubic hair around the penis or vagina.
Pubic lice are not linked to poor personal hygiene.
Symptoms of pubic lice
It can take up to 3 weeks after coming into contact with pubic lice before you notice any symptoms.
The most common symptom of pubic lice is itchy red spots. The itching is caused by an allergy to the lice saliva or poo.
It can take 1 to 3 weeks for itching to develop after the first infestation, and it’ll usually be worse at night.
Public lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour.
They’re hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair. They live mostly on pubic hair, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on your head.
You may also notice the following symptoms:
small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)
white or yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)
dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo)
crusty or sticky eyelashes, if they’re infected
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice, local pharmacy or local sexual health clinic if:
you think you might have pubic lice
Testing for pubic lice
If you think you might have pubic lice, get checked for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
What does a pubic lice test involve?
There is no test for pubic lice. Your doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice. They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected.
To help spot any pubic lice, your doctor or nurse may use a comb and a magnifying lens.
You can also buy treatment over the counter at your local
pharmacy
although they will not be able to diagnose the infestation.
Treatment for pubic lice
Pubic lice are treated with medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.
You’ll usually need to use treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You’ll need to repeat this a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.
You may be asked to come back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic once you’ve finished treatment to check the treatment has worked.
Your partner(s) should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms.
Resistance
Some pubic lice can be resistant to treatment. Resistance means that the lice will not be affected by a particular treatment. If your symptoms don’t settle, you may need to try more than one type of treatment.
Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if your first treatment hasn’t worked.
Treatment of lice in the eye area
Treatment of lice in the eye area is usually different from elsewhere. Certain creams and lotions are not safe for use near the eye area. Lice here can be removed with tweezers or Vaseline can be used to suffocate the lice before removal.
Things you can do
While you’re being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice from spreading.
Do
wash your clothes and bedding on a hot wash (50 degrees or higher), have them dry cleaned or put them in a plastic bag for at least a week – this will help kill any lice
hoover your mattress to remove any lice
Don’t
do not share clothes, bedding or hygiene products (including razors)
do not have any close body contact (including sexual contact) with anyone during treatment
How pubic lice are passed on
Pubic lice are spread through close body contact with someone who has them, most commonly sexual contact.
The lice crawl from hair to hair but can’t fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally only leave the body to move from one person to another.
Pubic lice don’t live on other animals such as cats or dogs.
If you or your partner has pubic lice, you should avoid having sex (vaginal, anal or oral). You should also avoid close bodily contact. Do this until you’ve both finished treatment, including any follow-up treatment.
How to prevent pubic lice
Pubic lice are easily spread, and
condoms
don’t protect against them.
To reduce the risk of getting pubic lice, you should limit the number of people you have intimate or sexual contact with.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with pubic lice you should get tested for other STIs including:
gonorrhoea
chlamydia
syphilis

About Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body – usually the fingers and toes.
It’s often referred to as Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease or just Raynaud’s.
Why does it happen?
Raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood.
This causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns. You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles.
Symptoms of Raynaud’s can last from a few minutes to several hours.
IIt’s not a serious threat to your health, but can be painful and difficult to live with. If can affect your ability to move your fingers and hands. People with Raynaud’s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.
Other parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud’s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.
Treating Raynaud’s
In many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud’s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed.
Stopping smoking
can also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation.
If you’re unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended.

Types of Raynaud’s
There are two types of Raynaud’s:
primary – when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)
secondary – when it’s caused by another health condition
Most cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma and
lupus
.
The causes of primary Raynaud’s are unclear. However 1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud’s, such as lupus.
Your GP can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud’s by examining your symptoms and carrying out
blood tests
.
Read more about
what causes Raynaud’s
and
diagnosing Raynaud’s
.
Possible complications
Secondary Raynaud’s can severely restrict the blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare.
Read more about the
complications of Raynaud’s
.
Who gets Raynaud’s?
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK.
Primary Raynaud’s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud’s can develop at any age, depending on the cause.
Raynaud’s is slightly more common in women than men.
Causes of Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body’s extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it’s sometimes linked to other health conditions.
When your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. This is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body’s core temperature.
In people with Raynaud’s, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow.
Symptoms can be triggered by mildly cool weather, getting something out of the freezer, or running your hands under a cold tap. Strong emotions such as
stress or anxiety
may also trigger symptoms.
Primary Raynaud’s
The most common form of Raynaud’s is primary Raynaud’s phenomenon. This means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition.
It seems that primary Raynaud’s is caused by disruptions in how the nervous system controls blood vessels. Exactly what causes these disruptions is unclear.
There’s some evidence that primary Raynaud’s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families.
Secondary Raynaud’s
In some cases, an underlying health condition could be causing the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud’s.
Autoimmune conditions
The majority of cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue.
Autoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary Raynaud’s include:
scleroderma – a condition that causes hardening and thickening of the skin
rheumatoid arthritis
– which causes joint pain and swelling
Sjogren’s syndrome
– where the immune system attacks the body’s sweat and tear glands
lupus
– which causes tiredness, joint pain and skin rashes
Around 1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s go on to develop an autoimmune condition.
Infections
Blood-born viral infections,
hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
, can occasionally trigger Raynaud’s in some people.
Cancer
Some types of cancer can cause secondary Raynaud’s. These are usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as:
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
– a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children
lymphoma – a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system
multiple myeloma
– a cancer that develops inside bone marrow
Medicines
Secondary Raynaud’s can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including:
some types of anti-
migraine
medication – such as sumatriptan and ergotamine
beta-blockers
– which are used to treat
high blood pressure
and
heart disease
some
chemotherapy
medicines
decongestants
the
contraceptive pill
medicines used in
hormone replacement therapy
some types of medicines used to treat high blood pressure
Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary Raynaud’s.
Injury and overuse
Raynaud’s sometimes results from a physical injury. It can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual.
Skin and tissue damage caused by frostbite can also lead to Raynaud’s.
Smoking
Smoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing Raynaud’s. Read about the
support available to help you quit smoking
.
Vibration white finger
Vibration white finger is a term used when secondary Raynaud’s has been caused by vibration. This typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as:
sanders, grinders and disc cutters
hammer drills
chainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowers
Any vibrating tool that causes tingling or numbness in your fingers could lead to vibration white finger.
Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. If the job can’t be done without vibrating tools:
ask to use suitable low-vibration tools
make sure you’re using the right tool for the job
check tools are properly maintained
keep cutting tools sharp
reduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between
keep warm at work
wear anti-vibration gloves
store tools indoors, so they don’t have cold handles when next used
encourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaks
If you’re diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. If you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully.
By law, your employer must contact the
Health and Safety Executive
about your condition. You may be entitled to an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, which is a payment given to people who have become ill or injured as a result of their work.
See the GOV.UK website for more information about the
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
.
Diagnosing Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon can usually be diagnosed after an examination of your symptoms and some blood tests.
Your GP may place your hands in cold water or cool air to see if you show symptoms of Raynaud’s.
Further testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud’s.
Secondary Raynaud’s may require more treatment and, in some cases, referral to a specialist.
Secondary Raynaud’s may be suspected if:
your symptoms only started when you were over 30 years of age – most cases of primary Raynaud’s begin between the ages of 20 to 30
you’re experiencing severe pain during an attack of Raynaud’s
only one side of your body is affected
Your GP may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. These capillaries are often larger in people with secondary Raynaud’s, and look like red pen marks.
Blood tests
Your GP may also refer you for
blood tests
to check for other health conditions that could be causing your symptoms. These tests may include:
a full blood count – to check for infection or, much less commonly, a cancer of the blood, such as leukaemia
an antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test – to check for an overactive immune system, which is common in people with autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma and
lupus
erythrocyte sedimentation rate – to check for an autoimmune disorder
Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK)
If you’ve been diagnosed with Raynaud’s,
Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK)

It is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by the condition.
Treating Raynaud’s phenomenon
You can usually treat Raynaud’s phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary.
If you’ve been diagnosed with secondary Raynaud’s, you may be referred to a specialist in the treatment of the underlying condition.
If your secondary Raynaud’s may be a side effect of a medication, you may be asked to stop taking it, to see if your symptoms improve.
Self-help
The following advice is recommended for both primary and secondary Raynaud’s.
Keep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. Wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather.
If you smoke, stop. Quitting smoking will improve your circulation, which should help to improve symptoms.
Exercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). For most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. Read more about
exercise
.
Try to minimise your stress levels. Regular exercise,
eating a healthy diet
, and
relaxation techniques
, such as deep breathing or activities such as
yoga
, can help. You may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola.
If you find it difficult to control feelings of stress, you may require additional treatment, such as counselling. Read more about
therapies for stress
.
Medication
Nifedipine
If your symptoms fail to improve, you may be prescribed nifedipine. This is the only medicine licensed to treat Raynaud’s phenomenon in the UK. It doesn’t cure Raynaud’s, but can help to relieve the symptoms.
Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker – a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen.
Depending on the pattern of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment, you may be asked to take your medication every day. Alternatively, you may only need to take it as prevention; for example, during a sudden snap of cold weather.
Side effects are common and include:
oedema – swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid
headaches
heart palpitations
dizziness
constipation
Don’t drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse.
The side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your GP if you find them particularly troublesome. There are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better.
Other medications
Other medications have been used to treat Raynaud’s, but their use is controversial, as there is limited evidence to show they’re effective in most people. However, some people have claimed to benefit from treatment. These medications include:
fluoxetine – which was widely used in the treatment of depression
sildenafil – which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection)
These medicines are not licensed for the treatment of Raynaud’s in the UK, but you may be prescribed them if it’s thought the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks.
Surgery
Surgery for Raynaud’s is rare. It’s usually only recommended if your symptoms are so severe that there’s a risk the affected body part, such as your fingers, could lose their blood supply and begin to die. Read more about the
complications of Raynaud’s phenomenon.
A type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. It involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm.
The results of a sympathectomy are often only temporary and further treatment and possibly more surgery may be required after a few years.
Complications of Raynaud’s phenomenon
People with Raynaud’s phenomenon have an increased risk of developing other problems, such as scleroderma.
Scleroderma
Around 1 in 16 women and 1 in 50 men with Raynaud’s develop a condition called scleroderma, usually between the ages of 25 and 55.
Scleroderma is when the body produces excessively high levels of collagen.
Scleroderma is a Greek word meaning hard skin, but it can affect other areas of the body, such as the kidneys, heart and lungs.
Symptoms of scleroderma include:
puffy and itchy skin
tight and uncomfortable joints
small calcium spots and red spots under the skin
trouble swallowing, known as
dysphagia
diarrhoea
, bloating or
constipation
There’s no cure for scleroderma, but there are ways of overcoming problems it may cause.
For example, medicines can reverse or slow down the processes that cause damage around the body.
For more information, visit
Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK)
, a UK charity dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by Scleroderma and Raynaud’s.
Ulcers and gangrene
In severe cases of Raynaud’s, the blood supply to an affected body part can become severely diminished. Without a constant supply of blood, the tissue in the body part will begin to die. This problem is rare and normally only occurs in secondary Raynaud’s.
The initial sign is an open sore, known as an ulcer, which develops on the surface of the body part. If you suspect a skin ulcer, contact your GP for advice.
Left untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene).
The symptoms of dry gangrene normally begin with a red line on the skin that marks the edges of the affected tissue. The tissue becomes cold and numb, and can be painful as the tissue dies. However, many people, particularly the elderly, experience no sensations.
The affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. The dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off.
These complications normally require admission to hospital, where you’ll be given medication designed to thin your blood, which should help to restore blood flow.
If you fail to respond to treatment, you may need surgery to unblock or repair damaged blood vessels."

About pressure ulcers
Pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure.
They are sometimes known as “bedsores” or “pressure sores”.
Pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle.
Read more about the
symptoms of pressure ulcers
.
How pressure ulcers develop
Pressure ulcers can develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time.
The extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming.
Pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially those confined to lying in a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time.
Conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as
type 2 diabetes
, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers.
Learn more about the
causes of pressure ulcers
.
Who is affected?
It’s estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least 1 pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition – for example, around 1 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer.
People over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin.
Treating and preventing pressure ulcers
Treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases.
For some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. For others, they can be serious and lead to life-threatening complications, such as
blood poisoning
or gangrene.
Read more about the
complications of pressure ulcers
.
Pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. Therefore, a range of techniques is used to prevent them developing in the first place. These include:
regularly changing a person’s position
using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body – such as specially designed mattresses and cushions
Read about
treating pressure ulcers
and
preventing pressure ulcers
for more information.
Unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it’s not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.
Symptoms of pressure ulcers
The parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair.
For example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your:
shoulders or shoulder blades
elbows
back of your head
rims of your ears
knees, ankles, heels or toes
spine
tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine)
If you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on:
your buttocks
the back of your arms and legs
the back of your hip bone
Severity of pressure ulcers
Healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.
Grade 1
A grade 1 pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured – it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1 pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard.
Grade 2
In grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.
Grade 3
In grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.
Grade 4
A grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.
People with grade 4 pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.
Causes of pressure ulcers
Pressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body.
This pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. Blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. Without a constant blood supply, tissue is damaged and will eventually die.
The lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. Once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria.
People with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body.
For example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night.
Pressure ulcers can be caused by:
pressure from a hard surface – such as a bed or wheelchair
pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements – such as muscle spasms
moisture – which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis)
The time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on:
the amount of pressure
how vulnerable a person’s skin is to damage
Grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers can develop quickly. For example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1 or 2 hours. However, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred.
Increased risk
There are several factors that increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. These include:
mobility problems – anything that affects your ability to move some or all of your body
poor nutrition – for your skin to remain healthy, it requires nutrients that can only be supplied by eating a nutritious diet
an underlying health condition that disrupts your blood supply or makes your skin more vulnerable to injury and damage
being over 70 years old
urinary incontinence
and/or
bowel incontinence
serious mental health conditions
These are discussed in more detail below.
Mobility problems
Possible reasons for having a mobility problem are:
having a spinal cord injury that causes some or all of your limbs to be paralysed
brain damage caused by an event such as a
stroke
or
severe head injury
, which results in paralysis
having a condition that is causing progressive damage to the nerves your body uses to move parts of the body – such as
Alzheimer’s disease
,
multiple sclerosis (MS)
or
Parkinson’s disease
having severe pain that makes it difficult to move some or all of your body
having a fractured or broken bone
recovering from the effects of surgery
being in a
coma
having a condition that makes it difficult to move your joints and bones – such as
rheumatoid arthritis
Poor nutrition
Reasons that your diet may lack nutrition include:
anorexia nervosa
– a mental health condition where a person has an unhealthy obsession with maintaining a low body weight
dehydration
– you do not have enough fluids in your body
dysphagia
– difficulty swallowing food
Health conditions
Health conditions that can make you more vulnerable to pressure ulcers include:
type 1 diabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
– the high levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes can disrupt normal blood flow
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) – blood supply in the legs becomes restricted due to a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries
heart failure
– previous damage to the heart means it is no longer able to pump enough blood around the body
kidney failure
– the kidney loses most or all of its functions, which can lead to a build-up of dangerous toxins (poisons) in the blood that can cause tissue damage
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
– a collection of lung diseases; the low levels of oxygen in the blood associated with COPD can make the skin more vulnerable to damage
Ageing skin
There are several reasons why ageing skin is more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. These include:
with age, the skin loses some of its elasticity (stretchiness), which makes it more vulnerable to damage
reduced blood flow to the skin, due to the effects of ageing
the amount of fat under the skin tends to decrease as people get older
Incontinence
Both urinary incontinence (inability to control your bladder) and bowel incontinence (inability to control your bowels) can cause certain areas of the skin to become moist and vulnerable to infection. This can cause pressure ulcers to form.
Mental health conditions
People with severe mental health conditions such as
schizophrenia
(a condition where people have problems telling the difference between reality and imagination) or severe depression have an increased risk of pressure ulcers for a number of reasons. These include:
their diet tends to be poor
they often have other physical health conditions, such as diabetes or incontinence
they may neglect their personal hygiene, making their skin more vulnerable to injury and infection
Diagnosing pressure ulcers
Pressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. However, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it’s important to assess a person’s risk of developing them.
As part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered:
your general health
your ability to move
whether you have any problems that may affect your posture
whether you have any symptoms that may indicate an infection
your mental health
whether you have had pressure ulcers in the past
whether you have
urinary incontinence
or
bowel incontinence
your diet
how well your blood circulation system is working
As part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests.
Blood tests
can be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition.
Urine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a
urinary tract infection
, which can be a cause for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage.
Self-assessment
If you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly check for early signs of the condition.
Look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. Use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. Contact your GP or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage.
Treating pressure ulcers
Treatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. Treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. In some cases, surgery may be needed.
Your care team
Pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. Therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. This type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Your MDT may include:
a tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention)
a social worker
a physiotherpist
an
occupational therapist
a dietitian
medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management
Changing position
It’s important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. Moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on the ulcers that have developed.
After your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a “repositioning timetable”, which states how often you need to be moved. For some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. Others may need to be moved only once every 2 hours.
The risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible.
You may also be given training and advice about:
correct sitting and lying positions
how you can adjust your sitting and lying position
how often you need to move or be moved
how best to support your feet
how to maintain good posture
the special equipment you should use and how to use it
Mattresses and cushions
There are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. Your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you.
Those thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1 or 2 pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body.
People with a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. For example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required.
Dressings
Specially designed dressings and bandages can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. Examples of these types of dressings include:
hydrocolloid dressings – these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry
alginate dressings – these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process
Creams and ointments
Topical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage.
Antibiotics
If you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. These are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading.
Antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present.
Nutrition
Certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin C, have been shown to accelerate wound healing.
If your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. As a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you.
Debridement
In some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. This procedure is known as debridement.
If there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. Larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. Some mechanical debridement techniques include:
cleansing and pressure irrigation – where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets
ultrasound – dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves
laser – dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light
surgical debridement – dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps
A
local anaesthetic
will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort.
Maggot therapy
Maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. Maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. They also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process.
During maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. After a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed.
Many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.
Surgery
It’s not always possible for a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer to heal. In such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring.
Surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction).
Pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. There is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including:
infection
tissue death of the implanted flap
muscle weakness
blisters
(small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin)
recurrence of the pressure ulcers
blood poisoning
infection of the bone (osteomyelitis)
internal bleeding
abscesses (painful collections of pus that develop inside the body)
deep vein thrombosis
(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg)
Despite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such as
blood poisoning
and gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue).
Complications of pressure ulcers
Even with the best possible medical care, complications can arise from grade 3 or grade 4 pressure ulcers and can occasionally be life-threatening.
These complications are discussed below.
Cellulitis
Infection can spread from the site of the pressure ulcer to a deeper layer of skin. This type of infection is called cellulitis. It causes symptoms of pain and redness, plus swelling of the skin. It will need to be treated with a course of antibiotics.
Read more information about
cellulitis
.
Left untreated, there is a risk that the infection can spread to the blood (see below) or the underlying bone or joint. In rare cases, where pressure ulcers involve the lower back, tail bone and spine, the pressure ulcer can spread to the membranes that surround the spine and brain. This is known as
meningitis
.
Blood poisoning
If a person with a weak immune system has a pressure ulcer that becomes infected, there is a risk that the infection will spread into their blood and other organs. This is known as blood poisoning or septicaemia.
In the most serious cases of blood poisoning, damage to multiple organs can lead to a large drop in blood pressure, known as
septic shock
, which can be fatal. Symptoms include cold skin and an increased heart beat.
Blood poisoning is a medical emergency. It requires immediate treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), so that the functions of the body can be supported while the infection is treated with antibiotics or antiviral medication.
Read more information about
blood poisoning
.
Bone and joint infection
Infection can also spread from a pressure ulcer into underlying joints (septic arthritis) and bones (osteomyelitis).
Both of these infections can damage the cartilage, tissue and bone. They may also affect the joints and limbs.
Antibiotics are required to treat bone and joint infections. In the most serious of cases, infected bones and joints may need to be surgically removed.
Necrotising fasciitis
Necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as “flesh-eating” bacteria, is a serious skin infection that causes rapid tissue death. It can occur when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with a particular type of bacteria, such as Group A streptococci.
Emergency treatment is required. It involves a combination of antibiotics and surgical debridement of the dead tissue.
Gas gangrene
Gas gangrene is a serious but rare form of infection that occurs when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with the clostridium bacteria. The bacteria thrive in environments where there is little or no oxygen. They produce gases and release dangerous toxins. Symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and rapid swelling of the skin.
Gas gangrene requires immediate treatment with surgical debridement. In the most serious of cases, it may be necessary to amputate the affected body part to prevent the gangrene from spreading to the rest of the body.
Preventing pressure ulcers
As part of your treatment plan, your care team will discuss with you the best way to prevent pressure ulcers. This will be based on your individual circumstances.
However, you may find that the general advice outlined below is helpful.
Changing position
Making regular and frequent changes to your position is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. If a pressure ulcer has already developed, regularly changing position will help to avoid putting further pressure on it, and give the wound the best chance of healing.
As a general rule, wheelchair users will need to change their position at least once every 15 to 30 minutes. People who are confined to bed will need to change their position at least once every 2 hours.
Once you have developed a pressure ulcer, it’s important that you minimise or avoid putting any further pressure on it to give the wound the best chance of healing.
If you are unable to change position yourself, a carer or relative will need to assist you. For more information and advice about positional changes, read about
treating pressure ulcers
.
Nutrition
Eating a healthy, balanced diet that contains an adequate amount of protein and a good variety of vitamins and minerals can help prevent skin damage and speed up the healing process. You may be referred to a dietitian so that a dietary plan can be drawn up for you.
If you currently have a reduced appetite due to a pre-existing health condition, the following advice may be useful:
Try eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 2 or 3 larger meals. Set a timetable for when you should eat, rather than waiting until you feel hungry. This should ensure that you receive the necessary nutrition.
Avoid drinking large amounts of fluids just before you are about to eat, as this will make you feel fuller than you actually are.
If you find swallowing difficult, try drinking specially made nutritional drinks or puréed foods and soups.
If you are a vegetarian, it’s important to eat high-protein alternatives to meat. Cheese, yoghurt, peanut butter, custard, beans and nuts are all good sources of protein.
Read more information about
healthy eating
for more advice.
Checking your skin
If you have known risk factors for pressure ulcers, it’s important that you check your skin on a daily basis for any signs of pressure ulcers, such as discoloured areas of skin. This is particularly important if you have an underlying condition, such as nerve damage or diabetes, which may dampen or numb feelings of pain in certain parts of your body.
You can use a mirror to check the parts of your body that are difficult to see, such as your bottom and the heels of your feet. If you notice any damage, report it to your care team. If you are at home, contact your GP or community nurse. If you are in hospital or a nursing home, inform one of your nurses or carers.
Quit smoking
If you are a smoker, giving up is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. Smoking reduces the levels of oxygen in your blood. It also weakens your immune system, which increases your risk of developing pressure ulcers.

quitting smoking

About reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body.
It usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without causing long-term problems.
The three most common places affected by reactive arthritis are:
the joints (
arthritis
), which can cause pain, stiffness and swelling
the eyes (
conjunctivitis
), which can cause eye pain and redness
the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body)
However, most people will not experience all of these problems.
Read more about the
symptoms of reactive arthritis
.
What causes reactive arthritis?
Reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel.
For reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed.
Read more about the
causes of reactive arthritis
.
Seeking medical advice
See your GP if you have swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had symptoms of an infection such as
diarrhoea
or pain when passing urine.
There is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs and
X-rays
may be used to check for infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms.
Your GP will also want to know about your recent medical history, such as whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an STI.
How reactive arthritis is treated
There is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness.
Symptoms can often be controlled using
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and painkillers such as
ibuprofen
.
Severe symptoms may require more powerful steroid medication (
corticosteroids
) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
Read more about
treating reactive arthritis
.
Who is affected
Reactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40.
Men are generally affected more than woman – particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men.
People who have a certain gene called HLA-B27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the UK, are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don’t have this gene.
Preventing reactive arthritis
The most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and bowel infections that most commonly cause the condition.
The most effective way of preventing STIs is to always use a barrier method of
contraception
, such as a
condom
, during sex with a new partner.
Read advice on
contraception
and
sexual health
.
Symptoms of reactive arthritis
The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually develop within four weeks of an infection.
In most cases, reactive arthritis follows a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or a bowel infection such as
food poisoning
.
The three parts of the body most commonly affected by reactive arthritis are the:
joints and tendons
urinary system
eyes
However, most people won’t experience problems in all of these areas.
Joints and tendons
Reactive arthritis usually involves inflammation of the joints (
arthritis
) and tendons, which can cause:
joint pain, tenderness and swelling – usually in weight-bearing joints such as your knees, feet and ankles
lower back and buttock pain
swelling of your fingers and toes
joint stiffness – particularly in the morning
See your GP if you have any swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had
diarrhoea
or problems passing urine.
The urinary system
Reactive arthritis can sometimes also involve inflammation of the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Symptoms of urethritis can include:
pain or a burning sensation when you pee
urinating more often than usual
having a sudden urge to pee
a discharge of fluid from the penis or vagina
blood in your urine (less commonly)
The eyes
Reactive arthritis may occasionally involve inflammation of the eyes (
conjunctivitis
). Symptoms of conjunctivitis can include:
red eyes
watery eyes
eye pain
swollen eye lids
In rare cases, a type of uveitis called iritis can develop. Iritis can cause the eyes to become painful, red and sensitive to light. See your doctor or an eye specialist as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.
Other symptoms
Reactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including:
feeling unusually tired
a high temperature (fever)
weight loss
mouth ulcers
painless white patches inside your mouth
a rash
thick and crumbly nails
abdominal (tummy) pain
bouts of diarrhoea
Causes of reactive arthritis
It’s not known exactly what causes reactive arthritis, but it’s thought to be the result of the immune system reacting to an infection.
The immune system
Your immune system is your body’s defence against illness and infection. When it senses a virus or bacteria, it sends antibodies and cells to fight the infection. This causes tissues to swell, known as inflammation, which makes it harder for the infection to spread.
In cases of reactive arthritis, something goes wrong with the immune system and it causes inflammation in parts of the body that were not infected, often after the infection has already passed.
Infection
The two most common types of infection linked to reactive arthritis are:
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – such as
chlamydia
or
gonorrhoea
, although many cases occur after non-gonococcal urethritis
infections of the bowel and digestive system (gastrointestinal infections) – usually caused by either campylobacter or salmonella bacteria, both of which can cause
food poisoning
Genetic factors
Research has shown that people with a specific gene known as HLA-B27 have a significantly increased chance of developing reactive arthritis, as well as related conditions such as
ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the spine)
.
In the UK, it’s estimated that around 1 in every 10 people have the HLA-B27 gene. Around 3 out of every 4 cases of reactive arthritis develop in people with the gene.
People with the HLA-B27 gene also tend to have more severe and longer-lasting symptoms, with a greater risk of their symptoms recurring.
Exactly how the gene contributes to the development of reactive arthritis is unclear.
Treating reactive arthritis
There’s no cure for reactive arthritis, but the condition is usually temporary and treatment can help to relieve your symptoms.
Most people will make a full recovery in about six months, although around one in five cases lasts a year or more, and a small number of people experience long-term joint problems.
There is also a risk you could develop the condition again after another infection.
Self-care
In the initial stages of reactive arthritis, it’s recommended that you get plenty of rest and avoid using affected joints.
As your symptoms improve, you should begin a gradual programme of exercise designed to strengthen affected muscles and improve the range of movement in your affected joints.
Your GP or specialist may recommend a suitable
exercise programme for your arthritis
. Alternatively, you may be referred to a physiotherapist for physical therapy.
You might also find ice packs and heat pads useful in reducing joint pain and swelling, although these should not be directly placed on your skin.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics
may not help to treat reactive arthritis itself, but they are sometimes prescribed if you have an ongoing infection – particularly if you have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Your recent sexual partner(s) may also need treatment.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
, such as
ibuprofen
, are the main medication used for reactive arthritis, as they can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.
However, taking a regular dose of a NSAID on a long-term basis can increase your risk of problems such as
stomach ulcers
. If you are at an increased risk of developing stomach ulcers, your GP may recommend an additional medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which can protect your stomach by reducing the production of stomach acid.
Rarely, long-term use of NSAIDs can also slightly increase your risk of having a
heart attack
or
stroke
. Read more about the
side effects of NSAIDs
.
Steroid medication
Steroid medication (
corticosteroids
) may be recommended if your symptoms don’t respond to NSAIDs, or you’re unable to use NSAIDs.
Steroids work by blocking the effects of many of the chemicals the body uses to trigger inflammation.
A corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually the preferred choice. Prednisolone can be given as an injection into a joint or as a tablet. Eye drops are also available if you have inflamed eyes (
conjunctivitis
).
Around 1 in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state, such as
depression
or hallucinations. Contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behaviour.
Other side effects can include weight gain,
acne
, stomach ulcers and
osteoporosis
, although these should improve as your dose is decreased. Read more about the
side effects of corticosteroids
.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
If your symptoms persist despite treatment with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids, you may be prescribed a medication known as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD).
Like corticosteroids, DMARDs work by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals your immune system uses to trigger inflammation.
It can take a few months before you notice a DMARD working, so it’s important to keep taking medication even if you don’t see immediate results.
A DMARD called sulfasalazine is usually the preferred option. Common side effects of sulfasalazine include feeling sick, loss of appetite and
headaches
, although these usually improve once your body gets used to the medication.
DMARDs may also cause changes in your blood or liver, so it’s important to have regular
blood tests
while taking these medicines."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/rhabdomyosarcoma/,"Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumour). Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma are younger than 10 years old. It’s more common in boys than girls.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Sarcomas are rare types of tumour that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. There are 2 main types of sarcomas:
soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body
bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body.
The most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina.
Sometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord.
Causes
The causes of rhabdomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. Children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma.
Symptoms
The most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma:
a tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding
a tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation)
a tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)
How rhabdomyosarcoma is diagnosed
Different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a
biopsy
) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic.
Tests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. These may include:
a chest
X-ray
to check the lungs
an
ultrasound
CT
or
MRI scans
blood tests
and bone marrow
Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you
Staging
The ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage helps the doctors decide on the most effective treatment for your child.
The staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is based on:
where in the body the tumour started
if it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease).
There are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child’s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using.
Treatment
Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.
The 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given:
to shrink the tumour before surgery
after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back
The drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.
Surgery
If it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.
Side effects of treatment
The side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.
Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick,
hair loss
,
tiredness
, and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.
Radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who’ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.
Late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Before any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. If you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. You may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. You will then receive the best standard treatment available.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
After treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. After a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet

About restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs.
It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too.
Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
Some people have the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person’s daily activities.
What causes restless legs syndrome?
In the majority of cases, there’s no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families.
Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome.
In some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition, such as
iron deficiency anaemia
or kidney failure. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.
There’s also a link between restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in 5 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it’s not clear exactly why this is. In such cases, restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth.

causes of restless legs syndrome
Treating restless legs syndrome
Mild cases of restless legs syndrome that aren’t linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as:
adopting good sleep habits – for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night
quitting smoking
if you smoke
exercising regularly
during the daytime
If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron in your body.
If restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that’s needed to treat the symptoms.

Who’s affected by restless legs syndrome?
As many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life.
Women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome than men. It’s also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood.
Outlook
The symptoms of restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it’s possible to address an underlying cause.
However, if the cause is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person’s life. Restless legs syndrome isn’t life threatening, but severe cases can severely disrupt sleep (causing
insomnia
) and trigger anxiety and
depression
.
Symptoms of restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs and an uncomfortable sensation in your legs.
The sensation may also affect your arms, chest and face, too. It has been described as:
tingling, burning, itching or throbbing
a “creepy-crawly” feeling
feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs
a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves
These unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable, and are usually worse in the evening and during the night. They can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.
Some people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time – for example, on a long train journey.
Just over half of people with restless legs syndrome also experience episodes of lowerback pain.
Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)
Up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.
PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.
Causes of restless legs syndrome
In many cases, the exact cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown.
When no cause can be found, it’s known as “idiopathic” or primary restless legs syndrome.
Research has identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.
Dopamine
There’s evidence to suggest restless legs syndrome is related to a problem with part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia uses a chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement.
Dopamine acts as a messenger between the brain and nervous system to help the brain regulate and co-ordinate movement. If nerve cells become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced, which causes muscle spasms and involuntary movements.
Dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day, which may explain why the
symptoms of restless legs syndrome
are often worse in the evening and during the night.
Underlying health condition
Restless legs syndrome can sometimes occur as a complication of another health condition, or it can be the result of another health-related factor. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.
You can develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you:
have
iron deficiency anaemia
– low levels of iron in the blood can lead to a fall in dopamine, triggering restless legs syndrome
have a long-term health condition – such as
chronic kidney disease
,
diabetes
,
Parkinson’s disease
,
rheumatoid arthritis
, an
underactive thyroid gland
, or
fibromyalgia
are pregnant – particularly from week 27 until birth; in most cases the symptoms disappear within four weeks of giving birth
Triggers
There are a number of triggers that don’t cause restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. These include medications such as:
some
antidepressants
antipsychotics
lithium – used in the treatment of
bipolar disorder
calcium channel blockers – used in the treatment of
high blood pressure
some antihistamines
metoclopramide – used to relieve nausea
Other possible triggers include:
excessive
smoking
, caffeine or
alcohol
being overweight or
obese
stress
lack of
exercise
Diagnosing restless legs syndrome
There’s no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome.
A diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, your medical and family history, a physical examination, and your test results.
Your GP should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome, but they may refer you to a neurologist if there’s any uncertainty.
There are four main criteria your GP or specialist will look for to confirm a diagnosis. These are:
an overwhelming urge to move your legs, usually with an uncomfortable sensation such as itching or tingling
your symptoms occur or get worse when you’re resting or inactive
your symptoms are relieved by moving your legs or rubbing them
your symptoms are worse during the evening or at night
Assessing your symptoms
Your GP or specialist will ask you about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. For example, they may ask you:
how often you have symptoms
how unpleasant you find your symptoms
whether your symptoms cause significant distress
whether your sleep is disrupted, making you tired during the day
Keeping a sleep diary may help your doctor assess your symptoms. You can use the diary to record your daily sleeping habits, such as the time you go to bed, how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake during the night, and episodes of tiredness during the day.
Mild
symptoms of restless legs syndrome
can usually be treated by making lifestyle changes – for example, establishing a regular sleeping pattern and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, alcohol or tobacco, in the evening.
If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to bring them under control.
Read more about
treating restless leg syndrome
Blood tests
Your GP may refer you for
blood tests
to confirm or rule out possible underlying causes of restless legs syndrome. For example, you may have blood tests to rule out conditions such as
anaemia
,
diabetes
and kidney function problems.
It’s particularly important to find out the levels of iron in your blood because low iron levels can sometimes cause secondary restless legs syndrome. Low iron levels can be treated with iron tablets.
Sleep tests
If you have restless legs syndrome and your sleep is being severely disrupted, sleep tests – such as a suggested immobilisation test – may be recommended. The test involves lying on a bed for a set period of time without moving your legs while any involuntary leg movements are monitored.
Occasionally, polysomnography may be recommended. This is a test that measures your breathing rate, brain waves and heartbeat throughout the course of a night. The results will confirm whether you have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
Treating restless legs syndrome
Mild restless legs syndrome that isn’t linked to an underlying health condition can be managed with just a few lifestyle changes.
If symptoms are more severe, medication may be needed.
Restless legs syndrome caused by an underlying health condition can often be cured by treating that condition. For example,
iron deficiency anaemia
can be treated by taking iron supplements.
If it’s associated with pregnancy, it usually disappears on its own within four weeks of the birth.
Lifestyle changes
A number of lifestyle changes may be enough to ease the
symptoms of restless legs syndrome,
including:
avoiding stimulants in the evening – such as caffeine, tobacco and
alcohol
not smoking – read more about
quitting smoking
taking regular daily
exercise
– but avoid exercising near bedtime
practising
good sleep habits
– for example, going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, not napping during the day, taking time to relax before going to bed, and avoiding caffeine close to bedtime
avoiding medicines that trigger the symptoms or make them worse – if you think medication is causing your symptoms, continue to take it and make an appointment to see your GP
During an episode of restless legs syndrome, the following measures may help relieve your symptoms:
massaging your legs
taking a hot bath in the evening
applying a hot or cold compress to your leg muscles
doing activities that distract your mind, such as reading or watching television
relaxation exercises, such as
yoga or tai chi
walking
and
stretching
A small medical trial carried out in 2011 found a type of osteopathic exercise technique called positional release manipulation could be of benefit to people with restless legs syndrome. It involves holding different parts of the body in positions found to reduce feelings of pain and discomfort.
Medication
Dopamine agonists
Dopamine agonists may be recommended if you’re experiencing frequent symptoms of restless legs syndrome. They work by increasing dopamine levels, which are often low.
Dopamine agonists that may be recommended include:
ropinirole
pramipexole
rotigotine skin patch
These medications can occasionally make you feel sleepy, so you should be cautious when driving or using tools or machinery after taking them. Other possible side effects can include nausea, dizziness and
headaches
.
If you experience nausea while taking a dopamine agonist, you may be given medication to help with this (antiemitic medication).
Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a less common side effect sometimes associated with dopamine agonists.
People with ICD are unable to resist the urge to do something harmful to themselves or others. For example, this could be an addiciton to
alcohol
, drugs, gambling, shopping, or sex (hypersexuality).
However, the urges associated with ICD will subside once treatment with the dopamine agonist is stopped.
Painkillers
A mild opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol, may be prescribed to relieve pain associated with restless legs syndrome.
Gabapentin and pregabalin are also sometimes prescribed to help relieve painful symptoms of restless legs syndrome. Side effects of these medications include dizziness, tiredness and headaches.
Aiding sleep
If restless legs syndrome is disrupting your sleep, a short-term course of medication may be recommended to help you sleep.
These types of medication are known as hypnotics, and include temazepam and loprazolam. Hypnotics are usually only recommended for short-term use (typically no longer than a week).
You may find you still feel sleepy or “hungover” the morning after taking your medication.
Levodopa
Levodopa may be recommended if you only have occasional symptoms of restless legs syndrome. This is because if you took levodopa every day, there’s a high risk it would actually make your symptoms worse.
Levodopa is available in tablet or liquid form, and you should take it once you feel the symptoms of restless legs syndrome coming on.
The medication will make you feel very sleepy (often suddenly), so you should never drive or use tools or machinery after taking levodopa."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/retinoblastoma-children/,"Retinoblastoma: Children
Retinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under 5, although it can affect children of any age. Treatment is very effective and nearly all children with retinoblastoma are cured.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Retinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina).
There are 2 forms of retinoblastoma:
a heritable form – this is genetic or inherited; there are often tumours in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in 1 eye
a non-heritable form – this is not passed on in the family; there’s 1 tumour in only 1 eye (unilateral)
Causes
The heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb.
Genetic counselling and support is available for families in which a member has retinoblastoma. Not all children of a parent with retinoblastoma will inherit this gene, but children born into families with a history of retinoblastoma are offered blood testing. They are also usually checked (screened) soon after birth for signs of retinoblastoma. This means that treatment can be started early if a tumour does develop.
Screening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for 5 years. An eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an ophthalmoscope. In younger children, this may need to be done under a
general anaesthetic
.
The genetic abnormality in the heritable form of retinoblastoma is now well-understood. But we don’t know what causes non-heritable retinoblastoma.
Signs and symptoms
Some children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms.
If there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph.
Some children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye.
How retinoblastoma is diagnosed
Tests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child’s eye while they’re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it’s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a
biopsy
). Your child will have several more EUAs to check how treatment is progressing.
When retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. This is known as staging.
They may have some of the following tests:
an
ultrasound scan
– this is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area
an
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan
– this uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head
a lumbar puncture – the doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) then the fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present
a bone marrow sample – this may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made); the doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells
a bone scan – this involves taking a series of
X-rays
to check for signs of any spread to the bones
a blood test – this may be taken for genetic testing for the Rb gene; the results of this test can take some months
The doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs.
Staging
The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage of your child’s retinoblastoma helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.
The following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma.
Intraocular retinoblastoma
There is cancer in 1 or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. This stage may be sub-divided into 5 grades (A–E), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there’s any damage to the eye.
Extraocular retinoblastoma
The cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. The aim of treatment is to first get rid of the cancer, and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. Some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. Your child’s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment.
Smaller tumours
For smaller tumours, treatment is given to the eye itself (called local therapy), while your child is asleep and under anaesthetic.
Cryotherapy
This is used to freeze the tumours. More than 1 session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals.
Laser therapy
A laser is used to heat the tumour. Your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks.
Plaque
A small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. The disc needs to stay in place for up to 4 days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods.
Thermotherapy
This process uses heat to destroy the cancer cells and may be combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as heat can improve the effectiveness of these treatments. The heat is produced by a laser, which is directed at the tumour.
Larger tumours
Chemotherapy
This is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It may be given before the local treatments mentioned above, to help shrink the tumour and make treatment more successful.
Chemotherapy
can also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there’s a risk that it may spread. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine.
Newer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy).
Surgery
If the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. The specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. An artificial eye is then fitted.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
treats cancer by using high energy rays from a machine to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be given to the whole eye but does have some effect on the surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy for retinoblastoma is normally only used when other treatments have not worked well.
Side effects of treatment
The side effects will depend on the treatment your child is having. The immediate side effects will usually improve when treatment finishes. But unfortunately, some treatments may cause side effects that develop many years later. The specialist will explain all of this to you before treatment starts. Your child’s follow-up will include checking for any long-term effects of treatment.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers.
If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
At least 9 out of every 10 children with retinoblastoma are cured. Following treatment, the eye specialist will frequently examine your child’s eye under anaesthetic to check that the retina is healthy, the cancer has not come back, and no new tumours have developed. Follow-up is usually in a clinic for childhood cancers, called a paediatric oncology clinic.
Children with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it.
Having the heritable form of retinoblastoma means an increased risk of developing other types of cancer later in life. Your child will be followed up closely into adulthood. They will be encouraged to get any new symptoms, such as a lump, checked early, and to have a healthy lifestyle to help to reduce cancer risk.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

About rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints.
The hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body.
There may be periods where your symptoms become worse, known as a flare-up or flare. A flare can be difficult to predict, but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints.

When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so your GP can try to identify the underlying cause.
Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage.
Read more about
diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis

What causes rheumatoid arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system – which usually fights infection – attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful.
Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone.
It’s not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke.
Read more about the
causes of rheumatoid arthritis
.
Who is affected
Rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the UK.
It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected.
How rheumatoid arthritis is treated
There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment.
The main treatment options include:
medication that is taken in the long-term to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition
supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, to help keep you mobile and find ways around any problems you have with daily activities
surgery to correct any joint problems that develop

Possible complications
Having rheumatoid arthritis can lead to several other conditions that may cause additional symptoms and can sometimes be life-threatening.
Possible complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammation of other areas of the body (such as the lungs, heart and eyes), and an increased risk of
heart attacks
and
strokes
.
Ensuring that rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled helps reduce your risk of complications such as these.

Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints, although it can cause problems in other parts of the body too.
The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis often develop gradually over several weeks, but some cases can progress quickly over a number of days.
The symptoms vary from person to person. They can come and go, and may change over time. You may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe.
Symptoms affecting the joints
Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected.
Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case.
The main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints are outlined below.
Pain
The joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity.
Stiffness
Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist.
Like joint pain, the stiffness is often more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called
osteoarthritis
usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often lasts longer than this.
Swelling, warmth and redness
The lining of joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch.
In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints.
Additional symptoms
As well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as:
tiredness and a lack of energy
a high temperature (fever)
sweating
a poor appetite
weight loss
The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, including dry eyes if the eyes are affected and chest pain if the heart or lungs are affected. Read more about the
complications of rheumatoid arthritis
.
When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
There are a number of conditions that can cause problems such as joint pain and stiffness, so it’s important to get a proper diagnosis.
Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis as soon as possible is particularly important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage.
Read more about
diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis
.
Causes of rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by the body’s immune system attacking itself. However, it is not yet known what triggers this.
Normally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.
This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.
This inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby:
bones
cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones
tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle
ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilage
If the condition is not treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and, eventually, can destroy the joint completely.
Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, including that an infection or virus may trigger this, but none of these theories has been proven.
Possible risk factors
There are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including:
your genes – there is some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition
hormones – rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen that is found at higher levels in women, although this has not been conclusively proven
smoking – some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis

National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):
Possible causes and risk factors
Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there is no definitive test for the condition.
You should see your GP if you have these symptoms so they can try to determine the cause.
Seeing your GP
Your GP will carry out a physical examination, checking your joints for any swelling and to assess how easily they move. Your GP will also ask you about your symptoms.
It is important to tell your GP about all your symptoms, not just ones you think are important, as this will help the doctor make the correct diagnosis.
If your GP thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist).
Your GP may arrange
blood tests
to help confirm the diagnosis after conducting a physical examination and consulting your medical history, or they may refer you at the same time as requesting tests.
Blood tests
No blood test can definitively prove or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but a number of tests can show possible indications of the condition. Some of the main tests used are outlined below.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
In an ESR test, a sample of your red blood cells is placed into a test tube of liquid. The cells are then timed to see how fast they fall to the bottom of the tube (measured in millimetres per hour). If they are sinking faster than usual, you may have an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
C-reactive protein (CRP)
A CRP test can indicate if there is inflammation anywhere in the body by checking how much CRP is present in your blood. CRP is produced by the liver. If there is more CRP than usual, there is inflammation in your body.
Full blood count
The full blood count will measure your red cells to rule out anaemia. Anaemia is a condition where the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, due to a lack of blood cells.
Anaemia is common in people with rheumatoid arthritis, although the problem can have many causes, so having anaemia does not prove that you have rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies
Specific blood tests can help to diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, but are not accurate in every person. About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor present in their blood when the disease starts, but about one in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also tests positive for this.
Another antibody test known as anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also available. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody.
Those who test positive for both rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP may be more likely to have severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring higher levels of treatment.
Joint imaging
A number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. These can help differentiate between different types of
arthritis
and can be used to monitor how your condition is progressing over time.
Scans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include:
X-rays

Treating rheumatoid arthritis
Stopping the condition progressing
There are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems.
These are often divided into two types of medication: ‘disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)’ and ‘biological treatments’.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you will normally be offered a combination of DMARD tablets as part of your initial treatment, as these medications are particularly effective in easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression.
DMARDs work by blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.
There are many different DMARDs that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
Methotrexate is normally the first medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another DMARD and a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any pain (see below). It may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned below.
Common side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth,
diarrhoea
,
headaches
and hair loss. The medication can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver, so you will have regular
blood tests
to monitor this.
Less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chest
X-ray
and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop
shortness of breath
or a persistent dry
cough
while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well.
It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first.
You may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that is most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term.
Biological treatments
Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. They include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab.
They are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective.
Biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints.
Side effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include skin reactions at the site of the injections, infections, feeling sick, a high temperature (fever) and headaches.
Some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as
tuberculosis (TB)
in people who have had them in the past.
Relieving pain
In addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain.
Some of the different medicines that may be used to relieve pain are outlined below.
Painkillers
In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as
paracetamol
, or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
These medications don’t help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. For example, they may be recommended while you are waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
In addition to – or instead of – the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
.
This may be a traditional NSAID (such as
ibuprofen
, naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib).
These medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time.
Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them.
Although uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems – such as internal bleeding – because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids.
If you are prescribed an NSAID tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids
are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation.
They can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints).
They are usually used to provide short-term pain relief – for example, while you are waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up.
Corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain,
osteoporosis
(thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin.
Supportive treatments
Your doctor may also refer you to other services that might be able to help you with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
Physiotherapy
A physiotherapist may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible.
They may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.
Occupational therapy
If rheumatoid arthritis causes you problems with everyday tasks,
occupational therapy
may help.
An occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you are at home and at work.
Some type of support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help open jars or turn on taps.
Podiatry
If you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help. You may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain.
Surgery
Sometimes, despite medication, damage to your joints may occur. In such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint.
Surgery may also be recommended to reduce pain or correct deformities.
Finger, hand and wrist surgery
There are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. Examples include:
carpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve)
release of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending
removal of inflamed tissue that lines the finger joints
Arthroscopy
Arthroscopy
is a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue.
During the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so that the surgeon can see the affected joint.
Special surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. You usually do not have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days.
Joint replacement
Some people with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery to replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. This is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty.
Replacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation.
The latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. They are not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one.

knee replacement
and
hip replacement
.
Complementary and alternative therapies
Many people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as:
massage
acupuncture
osteopathy
chiropractic
In most cases, there is little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them.
Nutritional supplements and dietary changes
There is no strong evidence to suggest that specific dietary changes can help improve rheumatoid arthritis, although some people with rheumatoid arthritis feel that their symptoms get worse after they have eaten certain foods.
If you think this may be the case for you, it may be useful to try avoiding problematic foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. However, it is important to ensure your overall diet is still healthy and balanced.
There is also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you are taking steroids and folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate.
However, there is some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis.
Living with rheumatoid arthritis
Self-management
Taking control of rheumatoid arthritis will help you cope with its impact on your lifestyle.
Arthritis Care offers self-management training courses to teach techniques for living positively with arthritis. Techniques include relaxation and breathing exercises to help pain control, goal-setting exercises and positive thinking to help give you some control over your condition.
A self-management programme specifically for people with rheumatoid arthritis has been developed by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS). The course helps people learn more about their condition and provides practical tips on how to manage everyday life.
Talk to others
Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from an individual or group of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Patient organisations have local support groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the same condition.
Call the NRAS helpline free on 0800 298 7650 to speak to a trained rheumatoid arthritis adviser. NRAS also has a team of medical advisers.
You can also call Arthritis Care’s free, confidential helpline on 0808 800 4050 (Monday-Friday, 10am-4pm).
Your feelings
It can be hard to deal with the unpredictable nature of rheumatoid arthritis. Some days, the pain and stiffness will be much worse than others, and there is no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur.
The difficult nature of rheumatoid arthritis can mean that some people develop
depression
or feelings of stress and anxiety. Sometimes, these feelings can be related to poorly controlled pain or fatigue. Living with any long-term condition makes you more likely to have a range of emotions such as frustration, fear, pain, anger and resentment.
Speak to your healthcare team if you are struggling to deal with your condition emotionally. They may be able to offer medication or psychological interventions to help.
Starting and raising a family
If you are taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or if you are worried about becoming pregnant while on medication.
Some medications, such as methotrexate, leflunomide and biological treatments, should not be taken by men or women while they are trying for a baby. The doctors and nurses will work with you to ensure your rheumatoid arthritis is controlled while you are trying to get pregnant.
Babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly so if you have rheumatoid arthritis. If you are struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you. You may also be able to get additional support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family.
Sex and relationships
Pain, discomfort and changes in the way you feel can affect your sex life. Your self-esteem or thoughts about how you look may affect your confidence.
Although many people find it difficult to talk about such private issues, there are resources that might help you. Talking to your partner or GP about the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on your sexuality and sexual relationships may help.
Money and benefits
If you have to stop work or work part time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.
You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:
If you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to
Statutory Sick Pay
from your employer.
If you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to
Employment and Support Allowance
.
If you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for a
Personal Independence Payment
.
If you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get
Attendance Allowance
.
If you are caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled to
Carer’s Allowance
.
You may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.

Complications of rheumatoid arthritis
Having rheumatoid arthritis can put you at a higher risk of developing other conditions, particularly if it isn’t well controlled.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
C
arpal tunnel syndrome
is a common condition in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
It is the result of compression of the nerve that controls sensation and movement in the hands (median nerve) and can cause symptoms such as aching, numbness and tingling in your thumb, fingers and part of the hand.
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can sometimes be controlled with wrist splints or
corticosteroid
injections, although surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve may be needed in severe cases.
Widespread inflammation
As rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, it can cause inflammation to develop in other parts of your body, such as the:
Lungs – inflammation of the lungs or lung lining can lead to
pleurisy
or
pulmonary fibrosis
, which can cause
chest pain
, a persistent
cough
and
shortness of breath
.
Heart – inflammation of the tissue around the heart can lead to pericarditis, which causes chest pain.
Eyes – inflammation of the eyes can lead to scleritis or
Sjogren’s syndrome
. Scleritis can cause eye redness and pain, whereas Sjogren’s syndrome can cause dry eyes.
Blood vessels – inflammation of the blood vessels is known as vasculitis. This can lead to the thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring of blood vessel walls. In serious cases, it can affect blood flow to your body’s organs and tissues and can be life-threatening.
However, thanks to early treatment, inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body is becoming less common.
Joint damage
If rheumatoid arthritis is not treated early or is not well controlled, the inflammation in your joints could lead to significant and permanent damage.
Problems that can affect the joints include:
damage to nearby bone and cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints)
damage to nearby tendons (flexible tissue that attach muscle to bone), which could cause them to break (rupture)
joint deformities
These problems will sometimes need to be treated with surgery to prevent loss of function in the affected joints.
Cardiovascular disease
If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you are at a higher risk of developing
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
than the population at large.
CVD is a general term that describes conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels, and it includes life-threatening problems such as
heart attacks
and
strokes
.
It’s not clear exactly why people with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of these problems, but you can reduce your risk by ensuring your arthritis is well controlled and by reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to CVD, such as by stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly.
Read more about
preventing CVD
.
Cervical myelopathy
If you have had rheumatoid arthritis for some time, you are at increased risk of developing cervical myelopathy and you may need a special assessment of your neck before any operation where you are put to sleep.
This condition is caused by dislocation of joints at the top of the spine, which put pressure on the spinal cord. Although relatively uncommon, it is a serious condition that can greatly affect your mobility and can lead to permanent spinal cord damage if not treated promptly with surgery."

About scoliosis
Scoliosis is the abnormal twisting and curvature of the spine.
It is usually first noticed by a change in appearance of the back.
Typical signs include:
a visibly curved spine
one shoulder being higher than the other
one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other
clothes not hanging properly
a prominent ribcage
a difference in leg lengths
Back pain is common in adults with scoliosis. Young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it’s less likely to be severe.
When to get professional help
If you or your child have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP. They can examine your back and can refer you for an
X-ray
for confirmation.
If you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it’s important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options.
Read more about
diagnosing scoliosis
.
Rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.
Phone 111 if:
there has been a new, significant trauma within the last 7 days, for example a fall from height or direct blow to the back
Or you have experienced a new onset of the following symptoms:
loss of feeling/pins and needles between your inner thighs or genitals
numbness in or around your back passage or buttocks
altered feeling when using toilet paper to wipe yourself
increasing difficulty when you try to urinate
increasing difficulty when you try to stop or control your flow of urine
loss of sensation when you pass urine
leaking urine or recent need to use pads
not knowing when your bladder is either full or empty
inability to stop a bowel movement or leaking
loss of sensation when you pass a bowel motion
change in ability to achieve an erection or ejaculate
loss of sensation in genitals during sexual intercourse
What causes scoliosis?
In around eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. This is known as idiopathic scoliosis.
A small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including:
cerebral palsy – a condition  associated with brain damage
muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness
Marfan syndrome – a disorder of the connective tissues
Rarely, babies can be born with scoliosis, as a result of a problem with the development of the spine in the womb.
In adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis.
Read more about the
causes of scoliosis
.
Who is affected
It used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it’s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well.
It can develop at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. In the UK, around three or four in every 1,000 children need treatment for scoliosis.
It’s more common in females than males.
How scoliosis is treated
Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe it is, and whether it’s thought it will worsen with time.
In very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve’s progression.
If the infant or younger child’s curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows.
In older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen.
The main treatments for older children are:
a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further
surgery to correct the curvature – where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires
In adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. Non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort.

Further problems
Scoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems.
Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.
If this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as
Scoliosis Association UK
. These groups are a good source of information and support for people with scoliosis.
In rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it’s severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs.
Read more about the possible
complications of scoliosis
.
Causes of scoliosis
In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented.
It is not thought to be linked with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet.
If the cause of scoliosis is unknown, it is called idiopathic scoliosis. About eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic.
However, researchers have found there is a family history of the condition in some idiopathic cases, which suggests a possible genetic link.
Idiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children. Some cases may only become noticable in later life.
Known causes
In a small number of cases, a cause is identified.
Other health conditions
Some cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular conditions), such as:
cerebral palsy – a condition that affects the brain and nerves and occurs during or shortly after birth
muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness
neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along your nerves
Scoliosis can also develop as part of a pattern of symptoms called a syndrome. This is known as syndromic scoliosis. Conditions that can cause syndromic scoliosis include:
Marfan syndrome – a disorder of the connective tissues inherited by a child from their parents
Rett syndrome – a genetic disorder, usually affecting females, which causes severe physical and mental disability
These conditions are usually diagnosed at a young age and children with them are often monitored for problems such as scoliosis.
Birth defects
In rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. This is known as congenital scoliosis. Congenital scoliosis is caused by the bones in the spine developing abnormally in the womb.
Long-term damage
In adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by gradual deterioration to the parts of the spine. This is known as degenerative scoliosis.
This can occur because some parts of the spine become narrower and weaker (
osteoporosis
) with age.
Diagnosing scoliosis
Scoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders.
You may be asked to bend forward to see if any areas are particularly prominent. For example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back.
Initial examinations are usually carried out by a GP. If scoliosis is suspected, you should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist (a specialist in conditions that affect the skeleton) for further tests and to discuss treatment.
Scans
The orthopaedic specialist will take an
X-ray
to confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis.
The X-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve. The medical name for the angle the spine curves is known as the Cobb angle.
In some cases, scans such as a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
or a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
may also be recommended.
Treating scoliosis in children
If your child has scoliosis, their treatment will depend on their age and how severe it is.
The main treatment options are:
observation
casting
bracing
surgery
These are described below.
There is a separate page about
treating scoliosis in adults
.
Observation
Treatment is not always necessary for very young children because their condition often corrects itself as they grow.
However, if the curve does not correct itself, it can reduce the space for the internal organs to develop in, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important.
Your specialist will usually recommend having regular
X-rays
to monitor the curvature to see if it improves, stays the same, or gets worse.
Casting
In some cases affecting young children, the spine may need to be guided during growth in an attempt to correct the curve. In a child aged under two years of age, this can sometimes be achieved by using a cast.
A cast is an external brace to the trunk made out of a lightweight combination of plaster and modern casting materials. The cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but is changed regularly to allow for growth and remodelling.
The cast will be changed under
anaesthetic
every two to three months with the aim of gradually straightening the spine. However, your child may still need to use a removable brace (see below) after treatment.
Bracing
If the curve of your child’s spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they are growing. A brace cannot cure scoliosis or correct the curve, but it may stop the curve from getting worse.
However, while there is some evidence bracing may be of benefit in certain cases, it’s not recommended by all scoliosis specialists.
If a brace is used, it will need to be carefully fitted to your child’s spine. To do this, a cast of your child’s back may need to be taken. This can be done as an outpatient which means that your child will not have to stay overnight in hospital.
Braces are often made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available. In general, modern back braces are designed so they are difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing.
It’s usually recommended that the brace is worn for 23 hours a day, and is only removed for baths and showers. The brace should not interfere with normal everyday activity and can be worn during most non-contact sports. However, it should be removed during contact sports and swimming.
Regular exercise is important for children wearing a brace. This helps improve muscle tone and body strength, and will help make wearing the brace more comfortable.
The brace will usually have to be worn for as long as your child’s body is still growing. For most children, this will mean they can stop wearing it when they are around 16 or 17 years old.
Surgery
If your child has stopped growing and their scoliosis is severe, or other treatments have been unsuccessful, corrective surgery may be recommended. They type of surgery will depend on your child’s age.
Surgery in children
For younger children, generally those under the age of ten, an operation may be carried out to insert growing rods. These rods aim to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine while partially correcting the scoliosis.
After surgery to insert the rods, your child will need to return to their specialist every 4-6 months to have the rods lengthened to keep up with the child’s growth. This procedure will be done through a small incision, and takes place often as a day case or an overnight stay.
In some cases, rods that can be lengthened using external magnets during an outpatient appointment may be used. Many children will also have to wear a brace to protect the growth rods.
When your child stops growing, the adjustable rods can be removed and a spinal fusion (see below) will be carried out.
Surgery in teenagers and young adults
In teenagers and young adults whose spine has stopped growing, an operation called a spinal fusion may be carried out.
This is a major operation where the spine is straightened using metal rods attached with screws, hooks, and/or wires, and bone grafts are used to fuse the spine in place. This metalwork will usually be left in place permanently, unless they cause any problems.
The surgery will take several hours. After surgery, your child will be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU), where they will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously) and pain relief. Most children are well enough to leave intensive care after a day or two, although they will often need to spend another five to 10 days in hospital.
After the operation, most children can return to school after a few weeks and can play sports after a few months. Contact sports should be avoided for 9-12 months. Occasionally a back brace may need to be worn to protect the metal rods after surgery.
Risks of surgery
Spinal fusion surgery is a major operation which, like any surgical procedure carries a risk of complications. It will not be recommended unless the surgeon feels the benefits outweigh these risks.
Some of the main risks the spinal fusion procedure include:
bleeding – if this is severe your child may need
a blood transfusion
wound infection – this can usually be treated with
antibiotics
the implants moving or the grafts failing to fuse properly – additional surgery may be required to correct this
in rare cases, damage to the nerves in the spine – this can lead to permanent numbness in the legs, and can sometimes cause paralysis of the legs and loss of control of the bowels and bladder
It’s important that parents and children understand the risks of spinal fusion surgery so that they can make an informed decision about treatment. Make sure you discuss the potential complications with your child’s surgeon.
Additional therapies
There is no reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic can be used to correct the curvature of the spine or stop it progressing.
The role of scoliosis specific exercises is currently under investigation.
Physiotherapy  may be beneficial when used in combination with a back brace. Exercise can help significantly with any muscular pain experienced with scoliosis, and back health in general.
Treating scoliosis in adults
Back pain is one of the main problems caused by scoliosis in adults, so treatment is mainly aimed at pain relief.
In some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the shape of the spine as a way of helping with back and leg pains.
Medication
Painkilling medication is usually recommended to help relieve the pain that can be associated with scoliosis.
Over-the-counter painkillers, such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
, are often recommended initially. See your GP if these don’t work. They may prescribe stronger painkillers or refer you to a specialist pain management clinic.
In some cases,
corticosteroids
or
local anaesthetic
may be injected into your back to relieve pain caused by the bones in your spine compressing or irritating nearby nerves. However, these injections only work in the short-term and are mostly useful in helping work out where your pain is coming from.
If it’s thought that
osteoporosis
of your spine is contributing to your symptoms, you may be given medication and supplements to strengthen your bones. Read more about
treating osteoporosis
.
Exercise
General strengthening and stretching exercises can improve your general posture and flexibility, and may help control any back pain.
Exercises can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which can reduce the strain on your back.
Some people may benefit from physiotherapy, where they are taught specific exercises to carry out.
Bracing
Braces are not often used to treat scoliosis in adults, although they can provide pain relief in some cases.
A brace may be considered as an alternative to surgery if you are not well enough to undergo an operation.
Surgery
Surgery for adults with scoliosis is usually only recommended if the curve in the spine is severe, if it’s getting significantly worse, for back pain related to standing in an abnormal posture, or if the nerves in the spine are being compressed.
There are two types of surgery:
decompression surgery – if a disc or bone is pressing down on a nerve, it can be removed to reduce the pressure on the nerve
spinal fusion surgery – where the position of the spine is improved using metal rods, plates and screws before being fused into place using bone grafts
These are major operations and it can take up to a year or more to fully recover from them. They also carry a risk of potentially serious complications, including:
failure to reduce pain – surgery is generally better at relieving pain that radiates to the legs, rather than back pain
the implants becoming displaced, broken or loose
infection
blood clots
rarely, damage to the nerves in the spine – in severe cases this can result in permanent leg numbness and the loss of bladder or bowel control
Read more about
lumbar decompression surgery
.
Possible complications of scoliosis
Physical complications of scoliosis are rare, although serious problems can develop if it’s left untreated.
Emotional issues
Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace may cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.
Modern back braces are designed to be difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing, but your child may still worry that they look different or unusual.
Encouraging your child to talk with other teenagers who have scoliosis can help improve their confidence and lessen any feelings they are alone with their condition.
There are several support groups, such as the
Scoliosis Association UK
, that provide information and support for people with scoliosis. Some also host message boards so teenagers from across the world can compare experiences, share tips and exchange messages of encouragement.
Lung and heart problems
In particularly severe cases of scoliosis the ribcage can be pushed against the heart and lungs, causing breathing problems and making it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.
This can also increase the chances of lung infections, such as
pneumonia
, and lead to problems such as
heart failure
.
Nerve compression
In some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. In severe cases, this can cause problems such as:

About ringworm and other fungal infections
Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn’t have anything to do with worms.
Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. These fungal infections, medically known as ‘tinea’, are not serious and are usually easily treated. However, they are contagious and easily spread.
Tinea fungal infections
There are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body:
ringworm (tinea corporis) – affecting the body
fungal nail infection (onychomycosis)
– affecting the nails
athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) – affecting the feet
jock itch (tinea cruris) – affecting the groin
tinea capitis – affecting the scalp
Ringworm usually looks like a round, red or silvery patch of skin that may be scaly, inflamed and itchy, but other fungal infections may present themselves slightly differently. Read more about the
symptoms of ringworm and other tinea fungal infections
.
When to see a doctor
See your GP if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it’s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. Symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. Other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don’t need to see a doctor unless it persists. However, pharmacists often prefer children to see a GP to confirm a diagnosis.
What’s the cause?
Fungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. Athlete’s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms.
Pets, such as dogs and cats, can have ringworm, and you can catch it by stroking them.
Read more about the
causes of ringworm
.
Who is affected?
It’s estimated that 10% to 20% of people will have ringworm in their lifetime.
Although children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected.
Groin infections are more common in young men.
Fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas.
Treatment
Most ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need
treatment with antibiotics
. Read more about
how to treat fungal infections
.
Stopping it spreading
It’s important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you’ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. Read more about
how to stop the spread of fungal infections
.
Symptoms of ringworm and other fungal infections
The symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is.
Ringworm (on the skin)
The symptoms of ringworm include:
a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin – your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside
scaly, itchy and inflamed skin
In more severe cases:
the rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together
the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy
blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings
The ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.
Face and neck ringworm
Ringworm on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away.
Hand ringworm
Ringworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.
Fungal scalp infection (tinea capitis)
The symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include:
small patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore
patchy hair loss
an itchy scalp
In more severe cases:
small, pus-filled sores on the scalp
crusting on the scalp
bald patches (if your hair is affected)
In very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. This can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.
Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis)
The main symptom of athlete’s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. In more severe cases, you may have:
cracked skin in the affected area
blisters
, which may ooze or crust
swelling of the skin
a burning or stinging sensation in your skin
scaling patterns around your sole, between your toes and on the side of your foot
Jock itch (tinea cruris)
The symptoms of jock itch include:
red-brown sores, which may have blisters or pus-filled sores around the edge
itchiness and redness around your groin area, such as your inner thighs and bottom (the genitals are not usually affected)
scaly, flaky skin on your inner thighs
Exercising, walking and wearing tight clothing or underwear can make the symptoms of a groin infection worse.
Fungal nail infection (onychomycosis)
The symptoms of a fungal nail infection include:
a whitish thickening of the nail
discolouration (the nail can turn white, black, yellow or green)
the nail can become brittle and start to fall off
the skin around the nail may be sore and irritated
Read more about
fungal nail infection
When to seek medical advice
Make an appointment to see your GP if you:
or your child develop the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection
have ringworm that has not improved after two weeks of treatment with antifungal cream
have another medical condition, or you’re having medical treatment that is known to weaken your immune system, such as
chemotherapy
or steroid tablets
Read more about
how fungal infections are diagnosed
.
Causes of ringworm and other fungal infections
Tinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin. Keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails. This explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails.
How it spreads
The fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. They thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. The spores can be spread in four different ways:
human-to-human contact
human-to-animal contact – for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat
human-to-object contact – both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes
human-to-soil contact – less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soil
As an adult, you can become a carrier of a scalp infection without developing any symptoms. This is because your body has usually developed a defence against the infection by the time you reach adulthood. If you’re a carrier of a fungal infection, you can unknowingly pass the condition on to children, who may then go on to develop symptoms.
Risk groups
You are more likely to develop a fungal infection if you:
are very young or very old
are African-Caribbean (in the case of scalp infections)
have
type 1 diabetes
are very overweight (
obese
)
have a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as
HIV or AIDS
are receiving medical treatment that weakens your immune system, such as
chemotherapy
or steroid tablets
have had fungal infections in the past
have hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)
have poor circulation (specifically, a condition called venous insufficiency, where the veins in your legs have trouble moving blood back to your heart)
Diagnosing ringworm and other fungal infections
Ringworm and other tinea fungal infections are usually easy to diagnose from their appearance and location.
Fungal scalp infections
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose a scalp infection after examining your scalp. Knowing exactly which fungus is causing the infection is useful, because some antifungal medications are better at treating certain types. Your GP will take a small scraping of skin from your scalp to test in a laboratory. You may be given an antifungal medication before you receive your test results. If the tests show that a different antifungal medication would work better, you will be prescribed that instead.
Ringworm and other fungal infections
Most fungal infections can be diagnosed by your GP after examining your skin and asking whether you have other related symptoms. Further tests will usually only be needed if your symptoms are severe or if they fail to respond to antifungal treatment. If this happens, your GP may take a small scraping of affected skin for analysis in a laboratory. Microscopic analysis will show if fungi are present and the specific type that is causing your infection. Read about
how to treat ringworm and other fungal infections
.
Treating ringworm and other fungal infections
Most tinea fungal infections, including ringworm, are easily treated by using antifungal creams, tablets or shampoo. You can also help to get rid of fungal infections and stop them from spreading by:
washing areas of affected skin daily and drying thoroughly, paying particular attention to skin folds and between your toes
in the case of a groin or foot infection, changing your underwear or socks daily, because fungi can persist in flakes of skin
with a scalp infection, not sharing combs, hairbrushes or hats
washing clothes, towels and bed linen frequently
wearing loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of cotton or other natural materials
Read more about
preventing ringworm
.
Ringworm, groin infections and athlete’s foot
Most cases of ringworm, groin infections and athlete’s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. There are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. You usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for 2 weeks. The cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. Read the manufacturer’s instructions first. You may be advised to use the treatment for a further 2 weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. See your GP if your symptoms have not improved after 2 weeks of treatment, because you may need to take antifungal tablets. Both terbinafine and griseofulvin tablets can be used to treat ringworm infections, as well as another antifungal medicine called itraconazole.
Treat groin and feet together
Groin infections can sometimes occur at the same time as athlete’s foot. It’s vital to treat both infections at the same time to avoid being re-infected with either condition.
Fungal scalp infections
Scalp infections are usually treated using antifungal tablets, often alongside an antifungal shampoo. There are 2 main types of antifungal tablet:
terbinafine
griseofulvin
The antifungal medicine that your GP prescribes will depend on the type of fungi causing the infection.
Terbinafine tablets
Most people with fungal scalp infections are prescribed terbinafine tablets to take once a day for 4 weeks. It’s an effective treatment for most cases. Side effects of terbinafine can include:
nausea
diarrhoea
indigestion
rashes
These side effects are usually mild and short-lived. Some people have also reported that terbinafine temporarily affected their sense of taste.
Terbinafine is not suitable for people with a history of
liver disease
or
lupus
(where the immune system attacks healthy tissue).
Griseofulvin
Griseofulvin is a type of antifungal medicine that prevents fungi from growing and multiplying. It’s available in the form of a spray and is usually taken daily for 8 to 10 weeks. Side effects of griseofulvin can include:
nausea
vomiting
mild
diarrhoea
headache
indigestion
However, these side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine. Griseofulvin can cause birth defects, so it shouldn’t be taken during pregnancy, or if you intend to become pregnant soon after stopping treatment. Men shouldn’t father a child within 6 months of stopping treatment. Griseofulvin is also not suitable for women who are breastfeeding, and those with severe liver disease or lupus. Griseofulvin can interfere with both the combined contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill, so women need to use an alternative barrier form of contraception, such as a
condom
, while taking it. Griseofulvin may also affect your ability to drive and can enhance the effects of alcohol.
Antifungal shampoo
Antifungal shampoo cannot cure scalp infections, but it can help to prevent the infection spreading and may speed up recovery. Antifungal shampoos, such as selenium sulphide and ketoconazole shampoo, are available from your pharmacist. Ideally, antifungal shampoo should be used twice a week during the first 2 weeks of treatment. There is no evidence that shaving a child’s head will reduce the risk of an infection or speed up recovery.
Itraconazole
Itraconazole is usually prescribed in the form of capsules for 7 or 15 days. It is not recommended for use in children, elderly people or those with severe liver disease. Side effects of itraconazole can include:
nausea
vomiting
indigestion
diarrhoea
headache

Fungal nail infections
Fungal nail infections can be treated with antifungal nail paint, but it also often requires antifungal tablets. These tend to work better than nail paints, although they can cause side effects, such as headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Read more about
treating fungal nail infections
.
Preventing ringworm and other fungal infections
The following advice will help to stop fungal infections from spreading. The fungi that cause tinea infections can survive on items such as furniture, hairbrushes, clothing and towels, and can be spread through contact with these items. Therefore, if someone in your household has a fungal infection, you should:
avoid sharing personal items – such as combs, hairbrushes, towels, clothing and bed linen
avoid scratching the affected areas of your skin or scalp, because it could spread the infection to other parts of your body
It’s important that other household members check themselves for signs of infection and get treatment if necessary. If you suspect that your pet is the source of the infection, take them to your vet for treatment. Patches of missing fur is a sign that an animal has ringworm. Always wash your hands after touching a pet with the infection. If someone in your family has a fungal infection, there is no need for them to stay off work or school. However, treatment should be started as soon as possible. Good personal hygiene should also be followed to stop it spreading to other children. Wearing something on your feet in gym and swimming pool changing rooms will reduce your chances of getting athlete’s foot. Find out

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/scarlet-fever/,"Scarlet fever
Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash.
The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as
Group A Streptococcus
, which are found on the skin and in the throat.
Scarlet fever symptoms
Scarlet fever usually follows a
sore throat
or a skin infection, like
impetigo
, caused by particular strains of Streptococcus bacteria.
The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. However, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days.
Speak to your GP if:
You or your child:
have symptoms of scarlet fever
do not get better in a week (after seeing a GP)
have scarlet fever and chickenpox at the same time
are ill again weeks after scarlet fever got better – this can be a sign of a complication like rheumatic fever
are feeling unwell and have been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever
Rash
The distinctive rough pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever.
https://dermnetnz.org/
The distinctive rough texture rash caused by scarlet fever.
https://dermnetnz.org/
The distinctive pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever develops 12 to 48 hours after symptoms like a sore throat or headache.
Red blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like
sunburn
. It may also be itchy.
On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent.
The rash usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, like the:
ears
neck
elbows
inner thighs
groin
The rash doesn’t usually spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.
The rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards.
In milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the rash may be the only symptom.
Other symptoms of scarlet fever
Other symptoms of scarlet fever may include:
swollen neck glands
loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone
a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)
a general feeling of being unwell
When to seek medical advice
If you think you or your child may have scarlet fever, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It usually clears up after about a week
Your GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.
There’s no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you’re heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you’ve been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever.
How scarlet fever spreads
Scarlet fever is very infectious and can be caught by:
breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes
touching the skin of a person with a Streptococcal skin infection, such as
impetigo
sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen
It can also be caught from people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don’t have any symptoms.
Who’s affected by scarlet fever
Most cases of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between 2 and 8 years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness.
As it’s easily spread, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks can occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another.
The symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the Streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins.
It’s possible to have scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare.
Treating scarlet fever
Most cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. However, your GP may recommend treatment as it:
reduces the length of time you’re infectious
speeds up recovery
lowers the risk of complications of scarlet fever
With treatment, most people recover in about 4 to 5 days and can return to nursery, school or work 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.
Without treatment, you’ll be infectious for 1 to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.
Antibiotics
Scarlet fever is usually treated with a 10-day course of
antibiotics
. This is often in the form of penicillin or amoxicillin tablets, although liquid may be used for young children.
For people who are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics like erythromycin can be used instead.
The symptoms usually improve within 24 hours of starting antibiotics, with the other symptoms disappearing within a few days. However, it’s important that the whole course of treatment is completed to ensure the infection is fully cleared and reduce the potential for
antibiotic resistance
.
Keep your child away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.
Adults with scarlet fever should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.
Self care
Many of the symptoms of scarlet fever can be relieved using some simple self care measures.
Do
drink plenty of cool fluids
eat soft foods (if your throat is painful)
take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature
use calamine lotion or antihistamines to relieve itching
Complications of scarlet fever
Most cases of scarlet fever don’t cause complications, particularly if the condition is properly treated.
However, there’s a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, like:
an
ear infection
a throat abscess (painful collection of pus)
sinusitis
(inflammation of the sinuses)
pneumonia
(inflammation of the lungs)
Very rare complications that can occur at a later stage include:
bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream)
septic arthritis
meningitis
necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin)
Streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome
(rapidly progressive symptoms with low blood pressure and multi-organ failure)
Speak to your GP immediately if:
You or child develop any of these symptoms in the first few weeks after the main infection has cleared up:
feeling very unwell
severe pain
severe
headaches
vomiting
diarrhoea
If your GP is closed, phone the 111 service.
Preventing scarlet fever from spreading
There’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever.
If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.
GPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected.
Do
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing
wash your hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues.
Don’t
do not share contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels"

About rosacea
Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face.
It can be controlled to some degree with long-term treatment, but sometimes the changes in physical appearance can have a significant psychological impact.
Symptoms of rosacea
Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing, where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as:
burning and stinging sensations
permanent redness
spots (papules and pustules)
small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible
Rosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others.
Read about the
symptoms of rosacea
Rosacea symptoms include redness and flushing, as well as stinging and spots.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
When to see your GP
See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. Early diagnosis and treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.
There’s no specific test for rosacea, but your GP will often be able to diagnose the condition by:
examining your skin
asking about your symptoms
asking about possible triggers you may have
In some circumstances your GP may arrange further tests to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as
lupus
or the
menopause
. For example, these could be a
blood test
or skin
biopsy,
where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined.
Causes of rosacea
The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face.
Although they’re not thought to be direct causes of the condition, several triggers have been identified that may make rosacea worse.
These include:
exposure to sunlight
stress
strenuous exercise
hot or cold weather
hot drinks
alcohol and caffeine
certain foods, such as spicy foods
Read about
causes of rosacea
Treating rosacea
There’s currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms.
Long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.
For most people, treatment involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, such as:
avoiding known triggers – for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine
creams and gels – medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness
oral medications – tablets or capsules that can help clear up more severe spots, such as oral
antibiotics
In some cases procedures such as laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment may be helpful. These involve beams of light being aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin to shrink them and make them less visible.
Read about more about
treating rosacea
and
self-help measures for rosacea
Living with rosacea
Any long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.
Many people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration.
It’s important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable.
Persevering with your treatment plan and avoiding your individual triggers are the best ways of controlling your symptoms.
As your physical symptoms improve, you may start to feel better psychologically and emotionally.
If you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you’re not alone. There are millions of people living with the condition in the UK and across the world.
You can find support and information from organisations like:
Changing Faces
– a charity for people with a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice
Speak to your GP if you’re feeling
depressed
as a result of your condition. They may recommend further treatment if necessary.
Ocular rosacea
Rosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious.
Symptoms of ocular rosacea can include:
feeling like there is something in your eyes
dry eyes
irritated and bloodshot eyes
inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis)
Rosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged. This is known as keratitis.
This damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight.
Symptoms of serious problems with your corneas include:
eye pain
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
deterioration in your vision
Contact your GP immediately if you think you may have a problem with your corneas. If this isn’t possible, visit
your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department
.
If keratitis isn’t treated promptly by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions, there’s a risk of permanent vision loss.
Symptoms of rosacea
Rosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all.
Most people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods when their symptoms are less so.
The main symptoms of rosacea include:
flushing
persistent facial redness
visible blood vessels
papules and pustules
thickened skin
These are discussed in more detail below.
Other symptoms associated with rosacea include:
sensitive skin – burning, itching, stinging and pain
dry, rough skin
raised red patches (plaques) on your skin
facial swelling
(lymphoedema)
Rosacea can cause different symptoms, including facial redness and flushing.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Permanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea.
Flushing
Flushing is when your skin turns red for a short period – usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest.
In some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat.
In rosacea flushing is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See
causes of rosacea
for more information about possible triggers.
Persistent facial redness
Persistent facial redness (erythema) is like a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn’t go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol.
This can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers.
The redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest.
Visible blood vessels
Over time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened (dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia.
Papules and pustules
If you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules).
These spots appear on your face and are similar to
acne
. Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2 conditions are quite different.
In rosacea there are no blackheads and the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don’t cause scarring.
Thickened skin
In the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. This causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma).
Rhinophyma is an uncommon, severe symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It almost exclusively affects men.
Causes of rosacea
The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested.
It’s possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn’t enough evidence to say this for certain.
Some of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below.
Blood vessel abnormalities
Some experts believe abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face may be a major contributing factor for rosacea. This may explain symptoms of flushing, persistent redness and visible blood vessels.
It’s not known what causes these abnormalities. But sun damage may be responsible for degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and the dilation of blood vessels.
Skin peptides
Recent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides.
Increased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or nerves and blood vessels (neurovascular system) of the skin. Activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation.
Microscopic mites
Microscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition.
It is currently uncertain whether the mite is a cause or an effect of rosacea, although some researchers have suggested the symptoms may be caused by the skin reacting to bacteria in the mites’ faeces.
Helicobacter pylori bacteria
Helicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria found in the digestive system. It’s been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although a link hasn’t been proven.
One theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand.
Genetics
Rosacea seems to be more common in families, although it’s not clear which genes – if any – are involved or how they’re passed on.
Triggers of rosacea
Although they’re not thought to be direct causes of the condition, many people with rosacea find certain triggers make their symptoms worse.
Different people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include:

Treating rosacea
Although rosacea can’t be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control.
Long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.
Treatment choices depend on which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, and are outlined below.
Self-help measures
There are a number of things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including:
avoiding things that trigger your symptoms – for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse
taking good care of your skin – for example, by using products suitable for sensitive skin
using make-up – patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up
keeping your eyelids clean – if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis)
Treating papules and pustules
If you have round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective.
These can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth.
Topical treatments
Topical medications are usually prescribed first. These include:
metronidazole cream or gel
azelaic acid cream or gel
ivermectin cream
Ivermectin is a relatively new medicine. There’s some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it’s not currently available on the NHS everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don’t work.
You’ll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. It may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms.
Side effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin.
Oral antibiotics
If your symptoms are more severe, an oral
antibiotic
medication may be recommended as these can help reduce inflammation of the skin.
Antibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.
These medications are usually taken for 4 to 6 weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent.
For example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term.
Common side effects of these medications include:
feeling and being sick
diarrhoea
bloating and
indigestion
tummy (abdominal) pain
loss of appetite
Some of the medications used can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds.
As with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks.
Oral isotretinoin
Isotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe
acne
, but at lower doses it’s also occasionally used to treat rosacea.
As isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your GP.
Common side effects of isotretinoin include:
dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils
inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or eyes
(conjunctivitis)
headaches
muscle or joint pain
back pain
blood in your urine (haematuria)
mood changes
Isotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.
Treating facial redness
Treating facial redness and flushing caused by rosacea is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.
But as well as the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help.
Brimonidine tartrate
Brimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a gel that’s applied to the face once a day.
The medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it’s first used, and this can last for around 12 hours.
Common side effects of brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied.
Less common side effects can include:
a dry mouth
headaches
pins and needles
dry skin
A rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication.
Oral treatments
Alternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea.
These include:
clonidine – a medication that relaxes the blood vessels
beta-blockers
– medications that decrease the activity of the heart
anxiety medications – medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing
It’s not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist.
Laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment
Redness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. These treatments may also improve flushing.
A referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they’re not usually available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for them privately. Around 2 to 4 treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant.
Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they’re no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area.
Laser treatment can cause pain, but most people don’t need an anaesthetic. Side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include:
bruising
crusting of the skin
swelling and redness of the skin
blisters
(in rare cases)
infection (in very rare cases)
These side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent.
Treating thickened skin
In some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as rhinophyma.
If you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to discuss ways the appearance of your skin can be improved.
A number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape.
This may be done with a laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion.
Treating eye problems
If rosacea is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.
For example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis.
If initial treatment isn’t effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you’ll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.
Preventing rosacea
If you have rosacea, there are a number of things you can do to help keep the condition under control.
Avoid triggers
Many people with rosacea notice certain triggers make their symptoms worse. Although it’s not always practical or possible, taking steps to avoid these triggers can help reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.
If you’re not sure whether your symptoms have a specific trigger, it may be useful to keep a diary to identify whether your symptoms get worse depending on things like the activities you do and foods or drinks you have.
Advice about how to avoid some common triggers can be found below.
Sunlight
As sunlight is the most commonly reported trigger of rosacea, you should use sun cream whenever possible, even when it’s overcast.
A sun cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 is recommended. A broad-spectrum sun cream that protects against UVA and UVB light should be used.
Using sun creams specifically designed for children may help reduce skin irritation. Covering exposed skin with clothes or a sun hat may also help.
Try to minimise your exposure to the sun during the summer months, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest.
But remember, sun can also be strong in the morning and evening, so take adequate precautions at these times as well.
Stress
Stress is also a commonly reported trigger of rosacea. Successfully managing your stress levels can help control your symptoms.
Ways you can reduce stress include:
learning relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga
taking regular exercise
As strenuous exercise can sometimes make rosacea symptoms worse, a low-intensity exercise programme, such as walking or swimming, may be better than high-intensity activities, such as running or aerobics.
Read about
stress management
.
Food and drink
Some of the most commonly reported food- and drink-related triggers are alcohol and spicy foods. You may want to try completely removing these from your diet to see if your rosacea improves.
But there are many other dietary triggers that can also affect some people with rosacea.
It’s a good idea to include information about how your diet affects your rosacea symptoms in your rosacea diary.
Cold weather
Covering your face and nose with a scarf can help protect your skin from cold temperatures and wind.
If you need to spend considerable time outside during cold weather, protect your face with a balaclava.
Skincare techniques
The advice below about skincare techniques may also help control your rosacea symptoms.
Clean your skin every morning and evening using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Use soap-free cleansers with non-alkaline or neutral pH. Avoid scented soaps and alcohol-based skin cleansers
Rinse your face with lukewarm water and allow skin to dry thoroughly before you apply medication or make-up
Look for products suitable for sensitive skin. These are usually described as mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (will not block pores)
Use a moisturiser to soothe skin if it feels sore
Avoid oil-based or waterproof cosmetics requiring solvents for removal. Use water-based make-up and skin products instead
Avoid astringents, toners and other facial or hair products that contain ingredients that might irritate your skin, such as fragrances, alcohol, menthol, witch hazel, eucalyptus oil, camphor, clove oil, peppermint, sodium lauryl sulphate and lanolin
You may want to avoid using anything on your skin that you aren’t sure of. You can then gradually reintroduce products once your symptoms have been treated and cleared to see if you can use them again without any problems
Men may find that using an electric razor, rather than a blade, helps reduce skin irritation
Some people find regular gentle facial massage reduces swelling
(lymphoedema)
Don’t use steroid cream unless you’re specifically instructed to by your GP, as it may make your symptoms worse
Skin camouflage
It may be possible to disguise patches of persistent red skin using specially designed camouflage make-up.
The charity Changing Faces offers a
skin camouflage service
, available nationally and free of charge, to help with the use of these creams.
Your GP or dermatologist can refer you to the skin camouflage service and prescribe skin camouflage make-up.
Eyelid hygiene
If your eyelids are inflamed as a result of rosacea (blepharitis), cleaning your eyelids every day with warm water and a small amount of cleaning solution can help ease your symptoms.
Avoiding eye make-up can also help reduce your symptoms, but if you do choose to wear eye make-up, make sure it is a type that washes off easily so you can still clean your eyelids."

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including:
hallucinations – hearing or seeing things that do not exist
delusions – unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence
muddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions
changes in behaviour
Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness. This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.

symptoms of schizophrenia
.
Why does schizophrenia happen?
The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
It is thought certain things make you more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition.
Read more about the
causes of schizophrenia
.
Who is affected?
Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About 1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives.
Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected equally.
There is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist.
It is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated.
Read more about
diagnosing schizophrenia
.
How is schizophrenia treated?
Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
People with schizophrenia will usually receive help from a community mental health team (CMHT), which will offer day-to-day support and treatment.
Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition has on your life.
Read more about treating schizophrenia.
Living with schizophrenia
If schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include:
recognising the signs of an acute episode
taking medication as prescribed
talking to others about the condition
There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition.

Symptoms
Changes in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.
The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories – positive or negative.
positive symptoms – represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions
negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic
The condition may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent “phase”.
People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.
If you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.

how schizophrenia is diagnosed

Positive symptoms of schizophrenia
Hallucinations
A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.
Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.
Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.
Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer’s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or one place in particular, such as the television.
Delusions
A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.
Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.
Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.
Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.
Confused thoughts (thought disorder)
People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.
People sometimes describe their thoughts as “misty” or “hazy” when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.
Changes in behaviour and thoughts
A person’s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.
Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.
Another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.
Negative symptoms of schizophrenia
The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.
Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.
It can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include:
losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex
lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns
being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say
The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.
Causes
The exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but research suggests that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.
Current thinking is that some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, it’s not known why some people develop symptoms while others don’t.
Increased risk
Things that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include:
Genetics
Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no one gene is thought to be responsible. It’s more likely that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia.
Evidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. This is true even if they are raised separately.
In non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition.
While this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia.
Brain development
Studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes aren’t seen in everyone with schizophrenia and can occur in people who don’t have a mental illness. But they suggest schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain.
Neurotransmitters
These are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. There is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Research suggests schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. Some studies indicate an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. Others have found a change in the body’s sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia.
Pregnancy and birth complications
Research has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development.
Triggers
Triggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include:
Stress
The main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. These kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it.
Drug abuse
Drugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness.
Certain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD or amphetamines, may trigger symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are susceptible. Using amphetamines or cocaine can lead to psychosis and can cause a relapse in people recovering from an earlier episode.
Three major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially “skunk” and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26.

Diagnosis
There is no single test for schizophrenia. The condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health.
If you are concerned you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and check they are not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use.
Community mental health team (CMHT)
If a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, your GP should refer you promptly to your local community mental health team (CMHT).
CMHTs are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions.
A member of the CMHT team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. They will also want to know your personal history and current circumstances.
To make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. Schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed if:
you have experienced one or more of the following symptoms most of the time for a month – delusions, hallucinations, hearing voices, incoherent speech or negative symptoms, such as a flattening of emotions
your symptoms have had a significant impact on your ability to work, study or perform daily tasks
all other possible causes, such as recreational drug use or bipolar disorder, have been ruled out
Related illnesses
Sometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. If you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness.
There are several related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. Your psychiatrist will ask how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as:
bipolar disorder
(manic depression) – people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions
schizoaffective disorder – this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person’s life or recur intermittently, often when triggered by stress.
You should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions, such as depression, anxiety and substance misuse.
Getting help for someone else
As a result of their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there is nothing wrong with them.
It is likely someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person’s care co-ordinator to express your concerns.
If someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their GP.
In the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available.
If a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise how to do this.
In severe cases of schizophrenia, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment under the
Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015
.
After diagnosis
If you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn.
It is important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available.
Treatment
Community mental health teams
Most people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (CMHTs). The goal of the CMHT is to provide day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible.
A CMHT can be made up of and provide access to:
social workers
community mental health nurses – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions
occupational therapists
pharmacists
counsellors and psychotherapists
psychologists and psychiatrists – the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team
After your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team. These specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers.
Care programme approach (CPA)
People with complex mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). A CPA is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs.
There are four stages to a CPA:
assessment – your health and social needs are assessed
care plan – a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs
care co-ordinator appointed – a care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT
reviews – your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreed
Not everyone uses the CPA. Some people may be cared for by their GP, while others may be under the care of a specialist.
You will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency.
Your care plan should include a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke, support for giving up.
Your care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan.

Acute episodes
People who have serious psychotic symptoms as the result of an acute schizophrenic episode may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide.
These episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care.
Crisis resolution teams (CRT)
One treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). CRTs treat people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis. Without the involvement of the CRT, these people would require treatment in hospital.
The CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre.
CRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring.
Your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis.
Voluntary and compulsory detention
More serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. You can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary.
People can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under the
Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015
. It is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary:
in the interests of the person’s own health and safety
to protect others
People with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards.
All people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary for them to receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare.
An independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend you remain in hospital voluntarily.
Advance statements
If it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement.
An advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include contact details for your care co-ordinator.
If you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.
Antipsychotics
Antipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect of the chemical dopamine on the brain.
Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.
It’s important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you.
Antipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). Several slow-release antipsychotics are available. These require you to have one injection every two to four weeks.
You may only need antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent.
There are two main types of antipsychotics:
typical antipsychotics – the first generation of antipsychotics developed during the 1950s
atypical antipsychotics – newer-generation antipsychotics developed in the 1990s
The choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects.
Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person.
The side effects of typical antipsychotics include:
shaking
trembling
muscle twitches
muscle spasms
Side effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include:
drowsiness
weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics
blurred vision
constipation
lack of sex drive
dry mouth
Tell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines that will help you deal with the side effects.
If you do not benefit from one antipsychotic medication after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. It is important that you work with your treatment team to find the right one for you.
Do not stop taking your antipsychotics without first consulting your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP. If you stop taking them, you could have a relapse of symptoms.
Your medication should be reviewed at least once a year.

Psychological treatment
Psychological treatment can help people with schizophrenia cope with the symptoms of hallucinations or delusions better. They can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment.
Psychological treatments for schizophrenia work best when they are combined with antipsychotic medication. Common psychological treatments include:
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts.
For example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts.
Most people will require between 8 and 20 sessions of CBT over the space of 6 to 12 months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour.
Your GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist.
Family therapy
Many people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. While most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family.
Family therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. It involves a series of informal meetings over a period of around six months. Meetings may include:
discussing information about schizophrenia
exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia
deciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophrenia
If you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to your care co-ordinator or GP.
Arts therapy
Arts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia.
Some people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others.
Arts therapies have been shown to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in some people.
NICE recommends that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist registered with the
Health and Care Professions Council
who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia.

Living with
As well as monitoring your mental health, your healthcare team and GP should monitor your physical health.
A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise, is good for you and can reduce your risk of developing
cardiovascular disease
or
diabetes
. You should also try to avoid too much stress and get a proper amount of sleep.
You should have a check-up with your GP at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure, and any appropriate blood tests.
Stop smoking
Rates of smoking in people with schizophrenia are three times higher than in the general population. If you are a smoker, you are at a higher risk of developing cancer, heart disease and stroke.
Stopping smoking
has clear physical health benefits but it has also been shown to improve the mental health of people with schizophrenia.
Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to quit smoking if you use NHS support as well as stop-smoking medicines, such as patches, gum or inhalators. Ask your doctor about this or phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84.
If you take antipsychotic medicines and want to stop smoking it’s very important that you talk to your GP and/or psychiatrist before you stop as the dosage of your prescription drugs may need to be monitored and the amount you have to take could be reduced.

Who is available to help me?
In the course of your treatment for schizophrenia, you will be involved with many different services. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority. These services may include the following:
community mental health teams (CMHTs) – these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services, and offer assessment, treatment and social care to people living with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses
trained peer support – this involves the support of someone who has had schizophrenia themselves and is now stable, and may be available through your CMHT
early intervention teams – these provide early identification and treatment for people with the first symptoms of psychosis; your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team
crisis services – specialist mental health teams that help with crises that occur outside normal office hours and allow people to be treated at home for an acute episode of illness instead of in hospital
acute day hospitals – an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital, where you can visit every day or as often as necessary
assertive outreach teams – deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems and provide rapid help in a crisis situation; staff often visit people at home, act as advocates, liaise with other services (such as your GP or social services), and can also help with practical problems (such as helping to find housing and work), and daily tasks (such as shopping and cooking)
advocates – trained and experienced workers who help people communicate their needs or wishes, get impartial information, and represent their views to other people; they can be based in your hospital or mental health support groups, or you can find an independent advocate to act on your behalf

Employment and financial support
Avoid too much stress, including work-related stress. If you are employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way.
Under the
Equality Act 2010
, all employers must make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities, including people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses.
Several organisations provide support, training and advice for people with schizophrenia who wish to continue working.
Your community mental health team is a good first point of contact to find out what services and support are available for you.
Mental health charities such as Mind or Rethink Mental Illness are also an excellent source of information on training and employment.
If you are unable to work as a result of your mental illness, you are entitled to financial support, such as Incapacity Benefit.

Talk to others
Many people find it helpful to meet other people with the same experiences for mutual support and to share ideas. It is also an important reminder that you are not alone.
Charities and support groups allow individuals and families to share experiences and coping strategies, campaign for better services, and provide support. Useful charities, support groups and associations include:
Hearing Voices Network
Mind
Rethink Mental Illness
SANE
There are also other places that offer support to people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
Day centres
Even if you do not have a job or are unable to work, it is still important to go out and do everyday things and give a structure to your week.
Many people regularly go to a day hospital, day centre or community mental health centre. These offer a range of activities that allow you to get active again and spend some time in the company of other people.
Work projects
These provide training to help you develop your work skills and support you back into work. They often have contacts with local employers.
Supported accommodation
This could be a bedsit or flat where there is someone around who is trained to support you and help you deal with day-to-day problems.
Peer support
You may be offered the chance to meet regularly with a trained peer support worker who has recovered from psychosis or schizophrenia themselves.

What can family, friends and partners do to help?
Friends, relatives and partners have a vital role in helping people with schizophrenia recover and make a relapse less likely.
It is very important not to blame the person with schizophrenia or tell them to “pull themselves together”, or to blame other people. It is important to stay positive and supportive when dealing with a friend or loved one’s mental illness.
As well as supporting the person with schizophrenia, you may want to get support to cope with your own feelings. Several voluntary organisations provide help and support for carers.
Friends and family should try to understand what schizophrenia is, how it affects people, and how they can help. You can provide emotional and practical support, and encourage people to seek appropriate support and treatment.
As part of someone’s treatment, you may be offered family therapy. This can provide information and support for the person with schizophrenia and their family.
Friends and family can play a major role by monitoring the person’s mental state, watching out for any signs of relapse, and encouraging them to take their medication and attend medical appointments.
If you are the nearest relative of a person who has schizophrenia, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the patient’s interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority ask an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with schizophrenia should be detained in hospital.

Mind: how to cope as a carer
Depression and suicide
Many people with schizophrenia experience periods of
depression
. Do not ignore these symptoms. If depression is not treated, it can worsen and lead to suicidal thoughts.
Studies have shown that people with schizophrenia have a higher chance of committing suicide. If you have been feeling particularly down over the last month and no longer take pleasure in the things you used to enjoy, you may be depressed. See your GP for advice and treatment.
Immediately report any suicidal thoughts to your GP or care co-ordinator.
The warning signs of suicide
The warning signs that people with depression and schizophrenia may be considering suicide include:
making final arrangements – such as giving away possessions, making a will or saying goodbye to friends
talking about death or suicide – this may be a direct statement such as, “I wish I was dead”, or indirect phrases such as, “I think that dead people must be happier than us”, or “Wouldn’t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up?”
self-harm – such as cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes
a sudden lifting of mood – this could mean a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of their decision
Helping a suicidal friend or relative
If you see any of these warning signs:
get professional help for the person, such as from a crisis resolution team (CRT) or the duty psychiatrist at your local A&E department
let them know they are not alone and you care about them
offer your support in finding other solutions to their problems
If you feel there is an immediate danger of the person committing suicide, stay with them or have someone else stay with them. Remove all available means of suicide, such as sharp objects and medication.

About scabies
Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.
The main symptom of scabies is intense
itching
that’s worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed.
Read more about the
symptoms of scabies
.
Scabies mites
Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs.
After 3 to 4 days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults.
Scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings.
Read more about
the life cycle of the scabies mite
.
How scabies is spread
Scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact.
It’s also possible – but rare – for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who’s infected.
It can take up to 8 weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period.
Read more about the
causes of scabies
.
Scabies outbreaks
Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas:
Africa
Central and South America
northern and central Australia
Caribbean Islands
India
southeast Asia
In developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes.
In the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year.
It’s difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don’t visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines.
Treating scabies
Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It’s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.
The 2 most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion. Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.
Permethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective.
If your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest
sexual health clinic
so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated.
Avoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.

diagnosing scabies
and

Complications of scabies
Scabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching.
Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.
Read more about
complications of scabies
.
Symptoms of scabies
The main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.
The
itching
is often worse at night, when your skin is warmer. It may take 4 to 6 weeks before the itching starts because this is how long it takes for the body to react to mite droppings.
Symptoms will start within 1 to 2 days if you’ve had a scabies infection in the past. This is because your immune system will have learned to respond to a scabies infection.
What does a scabies rash look like?
The scabies rash consists of tiny red spots. Scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.
Burrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. They’re short (1cm or less), wavy, silver-coloured lines on the skin, with a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.
Scabies cause burrow marks of short, wavy and silver-coloured lines.

A scabies rash often appears on the palms of the hands.
Source: https://dermnetnz.org/
Where does a scabies rash develop?
In adults, burrow marks often appear in the following areas:
the folds of skin between fingers and toes
the palms of the hands
the soles and sides of the feet
the wrists
the elbows
around the nipples (in women)
around the genital area (in men)
The rash usually affects the whole body, apart from the head. The following areas can be particularly affected:
the underarm area
around the waist
the inside of the elbow
the lower buttocks
the lower legs
the soles of the feet
the knees
the shoulder blades
the female genital area
the groin
around the ankles
Elderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck.
Men usually have 1 or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis and scrotum).
In infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different places on their body, including on the:
face
head
neck
scalp
palms of the hands
soles of the feet
Scabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. These marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin.
In infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.
Causes of scabies
Scabies is a skin condition caused by the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei.
The intense
itching
associated with scabies is thought to be caused by the immune system reacting to the mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces.
The scabies mite life cycle
A scabies infestation starts when a female mite burrows into your skin.
Male mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. After mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which hatch around 3 to 4 days later.
After hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. Male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. The life cycle is then repeated.
Without effective treatment, the life cycle of the scabies mite can continue indefinitely. Scabies mites are resistant to soap and hot water and can’t be scrubbed out of the skin.
How scabies is spread
Scabies mites can’t fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2 people have direct and prolonged physical contact.
For example, scabies mites can be transmitted by:
holding hands with an infected person for a prolonged period of time
having sex with an infected person
sharing clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although this is rare)
It’s unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging.
Scabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels or bed linen a possibility. However, it’s rare for someone to be infected in this way.
Scabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware they have the condition until 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection.
There’s an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another.
Diagnosing scabies
Your GP should be able to diagnose scabies from the appearance of your skin, and by looking for the burrow marks of the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.
However, as scabies is spread very easily, it’s often possible to make a confident diagnosis if more than one family member has the same symptoms.
Your GP will also want to rule out other skin conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as
eczema
or
impetigo
(a highly contagious bacterial skin infection).
Read more about the
symptoms of scabies
.
Ink test
The burrows of scabies mites can be identified by using an ink test. Ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin before being wiped off with an alcohol pad.
If scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line.
To confirm the diagnosis, a skin sample may be gently scraped from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope for evidence of scabies mites, their eggs and faeces (poo).
Where to get help with scabies
Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. If you think you have genital scabies or your partner has been diagnosed with it, visit
your nearest sexual health clinic
, where you’ll be examined and, if necessary, treated.
If you decide to treat scabies yourself, you’ll need to have a full sexual health check to make sure you don’t have any
sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
.
To prevent reinfection, it’s important that all members of your household are treated, as well as any sexual partners you’ve had over the last 6 weeks (in the case of genital scabies). If you’ve had genital scabies in the past, anyone you’ve had sex with in the previous 48 hours will need to be treated.
If you’re embarrassed about contacting previous sexual partners, your GP surgery or local sexual health clinic may be able to inform them that they’ve been exposed to scabies on your behalf without disclosing your identity.
Sexual health clinics
Some sexual health clinics operate on a walk-in basis. Others work by appointment only. It’s therefore a good idea to call first.
When you attend a clinic, you’ll be asked for your name, date of birth and contact details. These details will be treated confidentially and won’t be passed on to your GP without your agreement.
You’ll also be asked about your sexual history, including:
when you last had sex
whether you used
condoms
whether you’ve had an STI in the past
whether you’re taking any medication
If you’re attending a clinic for scabies, you may also be offered tests for STIs.
Treating scabies
See your GP immediately if you have scabies and you haven’t had a previous infection. Delaying treatment places other people at risk.
As other more serious skin conditions can sometimes cause similar symptoms to the
symptoms of scabies
, your GP will need to rule these out.
If you have scabies, your partner will also need to be treated regardless of whether or not they have any symptoms. This is because it’s highly likely that scabies will have been transmitted through close bodily contact, such as during sex.
To reduce the risk of reinfection, avoid having sex and other forms of prolonged close bodily contact, such as holding hands, until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.
If you’ve been diagnosed with scabies, you may be advised to visit your
nearest sexual health clinic
to be checked and, if necessary, treated for other
sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
.
Lotions and creams
Lotions and creams are commonly used to treat scabies. Your GP, pharmacist or nurse will be able to advise you about which treatment to use.
Applying the cream or lotion
To prevent reinfection, all members of your household and any close contacts, including recent sexual partners, should be treated at the same time as you, even if they don’t have any symptoms.
The cream or lotion should be applied to the skin of all of your body, except your head. Before you apply it, make sure your skin is cool and dry. Don’t apply it after having a hot bath.
If you apply it when your body is hot, it will quickly be absorbed into your skin and won’t remain on the area where the scabies burrows are.
When using a cream or lotion to treat scabies, you should also:
read the patient leaflet that comes with the cream or lotion for details of where to apply it – some products need to be applied to the whole body, including the scalp and face, whereas others must only be applied from the neck down
pay particular attention to difficult-to-reach areas, like your back, the soles of your feet, in between your fingers and toes, under fingernails, and on your genitals
use a cotton bud or old toothbrush to apply the treatment under fingernails and toenails – put the cotton bud or toothbrush in a bag and throw it away afterwards
leave the treatment on your skin for 8 to 24 hours (depending on the preparation used) before washing it off thoroughly – follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding how long to leave the cream or lotion on for
reapply the cream or lotion immediately to any areas of skin that are washed during the period of application
wash bed linen, nightwear and towels after the first application
repeat the treatment process 7 days after the first application to ensure it’s successful – the second application will ensure any mites hatched from existing eggs are killed
It can take a month after treatment for the general itching to subside completely, and longer for the lumpy genital lesions to resolve. Your GP may recommend repeating the treatment or they may prescribe a different lotion.
Speak to your GP if:
the itching hasn’t improved after 2 weeks of treatment and you notice new burrows on your skin
you experience any persistent side effects
Managing a scabies infection
On the day you first apply the cream or lotion, you should wash all bed linen, nightwear and towels at a temperature above 50C (122F).
If you’re unable to wash certain items, place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. After this time, the scabies mites will have died.
In cases of crusted scabies, you should clean the floors in your house and thoroughly vacuum your carpets and furniture, including the armchairs and sofa.
If you’ve been diagnosed with scabies, avoid close and prolonged physical contact with others until you’ve applied the cream or lotion. You should also avoid close contact with other members of your household until their treatment has been completed.
Children and adults can return to school or work after the first treatment has been completed.
Treating the itch
Your GP should be able to prescribe treatments, such as a mild steroid cream, to reduce the itchiness. Menthol cream or gel, available from pharmacies without a prescription, may also help relieve itchy skin.
Oral sedative antihistamines are also available from your local pharmacy and can be used to control itching and help you get a better night’s sleep.
As this type of antihistamine can cause drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you’re affected in this way.
Non-sedating antihistamines don’t help relieve the itching of scabies. Check with your GP or pharmacist if you’re unsure.
You may continue to experience itchiness for a couple of weeks after your treatment has been completed. This is because your immune system will still be reacting to the presence of dead mites and their droppings.
Visit your GP if you’re still experiencing itchiness 6 weeks after completing your treatment.
Complications of scabies
A secondary infection and crusted scabies are 2 possible complications of scabies.
Secondary infection
Repeatedly scratching itchy skin caused by scabies may break the skin’s surface. This will make you more vulnerable to developing a bacterial skin infection, such as
impetigo
.
Antibiotics
may be recommended to control a secondary infection.
Scabies has been known to make some pre-existing skin conditions, such as
eczema
, worse. However, other skin conditions should settle down after the scabies infection has been successfully treated.
Crusted scabies
Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies. This means thousands or even millions of scabies mites are present.
Normal scabies can develop into crusted scabies after a skin reaction. The condition affects all parts of the body, including your head, neck, nails and scalp. However, unlike normal scabies, the rash associated with crusted scabies usually doesn’t itch.
In crusted scabies, the increase in the number of mites causes thick, warty crusts to develop on the skin. It’s often mistaken for
psoriasis
(a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales).
Crusted scabies affects people with a weakened immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). This includes:
the very young
people with brain disorders (neurological disorders, such as
Parkinson’s disease
)
people with Down’s syndrome
pregnant women
elderly people
people with a condition that affects their immune system, such as
HIV or AIDs
people who are taking steroids to treat other medical conditions
people who are having
chemotherapy
treatment
Research has found a healthy immune system appears to interrupt the
reproductive cycle of the scabies mite
. For example, most people with scabies will only have 5 to 15 mites on their body at any one time.
However, if you have a weakened immune system, the number of scabies mites can increase significantly. People with crusted scabies can have thousands or millions of scabies mites on their body at any one time.
Because of the high number of scabies mites, crusted scabies is highly contagious. Even minimal physical contact with a person with crusted scabies, or with their bed linen or clothes, can lead to infection.
However, contact with someone with crusted scabies will only lead to the normal type of scabies in people with a healthy immune system.
Crusted scabies can be treated using insecticide creams or a medicine called ivermectin, which is taken by swallowing a tablet. Ivermectin kills the mites by stopping their nervous system working."

About sickle cell disease
Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. The most severe is sickle cell anaemia. These disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes.
You can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell disease affects how your body produces red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are round – red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease harden and become sickle-shaped, like a crescent moon. This causes them to die too quickly and block blood vessels, leading to symptoms that are often painful.
People from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. You are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds:
African
Asian
Caribbean
Eastern Mediterranean
Middle Eastern
There are treatments to manage sickle cell disease, but no cure yet – it’s a lifelong condition.
Find out about symptoms and diagnosis
Find out about treating sickle cell disease
Find out about living with sickle cell disease
Find out about screening to see if you’re a sickle cell carrier
​Symptoms and diagnosis
The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.
Getting immediate medical advice
There are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately:
high temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher
difficulty breathing
drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech
a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness
skin or lips that are very pale
fits (seizures)
serious pain that isn’t responding to treatments at home
sudden swelling in the tummy
priapism – a painful erection lasting two hours or more
weakness on one or both sides of your body
sudden vision loss, or changes in your vision
If you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your GP or care team immediately. If you can’t contact your GP or care team, go to your closest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren’t able to travel yourself.
It’s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell crises
Episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.
Sickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks – others experience them less than once a year.
A sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are:
hands or feet (this is especially common in young children)
ribs and breastbone
spine
pelvis
tummy
legs and arms
Sickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.
Infection
Sickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren’t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.
As well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.
Anaemia
Almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it’s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.
Most of the time anaemia doesn’t cause symptoms, but if you’re infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. When that happens, it causes:
headaches
a fast heartbeat
fainting
dizziness
If these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.
Sudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion.
Other sickle cell disease symptoms
There’s a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include:
a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever
pain in bones and joints
delayed puberty
delayed growth in childhood
kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine
gallstones – these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain
ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful)
priapism – a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours
high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension)
transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes – these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked
enlarged spleen – this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain
vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss
These symptoms can be treated – see
Treating sickle cell disease
for more information.
Diagnosing sickle cell disease
You can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you’re a carrier who could have a child with the condition.
Sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy – free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland.
Even if your family background doesn’t make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.
If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.
Newborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test – the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this:
if a baby’s parents weren’t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease
if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not
this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers
here
)
the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis
Another blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.

People of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. A specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it.
Treating and preventing sickle cell crises
Sickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. The following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis:
over the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help – although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 – and if needed, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers
heating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain – pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this
drink plenty – staying hydrated will help
relaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child’s mind, from the pain
If none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your GP. You or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (A&E) if it’s not possible to contact your GP. It may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief.
The best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them.
Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids –especially water.
Avoid alcohol – alcohol causes dehydration.
Stay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures.
Don’t expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature – for example, avoid swimming in cold water.
The lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you’re at high altitude for any reason. However, plane travel shouldn’t be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised.
Make sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath.
Don’t smoke – smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome.
Stay relaxed as much as you can – sickle cell crises can be triggered by stress, so consider learning relaxation techniques like
breathing exercises
.
Your care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. This is a capsule that is taken once a day. It works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body.
This means that you’ll need regular blood tests to make sure you’re healthy.
Treating and preventing infections
Children who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis B vaccine and the annual flu vaccine.
If you have sickle cell disease, you’ll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. This will not pose serious health risks.
Reduce risk in day-to-day life by being careful about activities that can make you vulnerable to infection. Always follow
good food hygiene measures
, for example.
If you’re planning to go abroad, talk to your GP as far in advance as you can. You might need
extra vaccinations
or medication, such as anti-malarials if you’re going to a place where
malaria
is a risk. It may also be a good idea to take extra precautions when it comes to food and water.
Treating anaemia
Most of the time, anaemia doesn’t have any symptoms and you won’t require any treatment for it. However, children with sickle cell anaemia who are also on a restricted diet (such as a vegan or vegetarian diet) may need folic acid supplements. Folic acid helps your body to create more red blood cells, so it can help to improve anaemia.
It’s important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn’t the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don’t take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. Taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous.
Blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia.
Treating other sickle cell disease-related issues
There are a range of treatments for other problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease, depending on the type of symptom and how severe it is:
people with acute chest syndrome need emergency treatment – this involves oxygen, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and fluids given through a vein, as well as possibly hydroxycarbamide to prevent it happening again
painkillers can treat joint and bone pain
a short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty
gallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones
for persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis
regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having one
In addition to the treatments above, chelation therapy involves taking medication to make the level of iron in your blood lower, bringing it to safe levels. This treatment is given to people who need a lot of blood transfusions.

​Living with sickle cell disease
Sickle cell disease is a lifelong illness, which can be managed well with treatment and self-help. In addition to preventing symptoms and crises as much as possible, there are a few things you can do that will make it easier to live with the condition and stay in the best possible health.
Getting surgery when you have sickle cell disease
If you’re due to have surgery, or you’re brought in for surgery in an emergency, it’s very important you take some precautions.
You should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic.
Tell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease.
General anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. It’s important that you’re monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm.
It might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications.
Pregnancy and birth with sickle cell disease
You can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it’s a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons:
there’s a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you’re pregnant
you may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus
it may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean
extra monitoring during pregnancy, as well as extra treatment, might be necessary
It’s important to use a reliable form of
contraception
if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.
Learn about pregnancy and newborn screening for sickle cell disease
The outlook for people with sickle cell disease
Most children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. However, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it’s still a serious condition.
Sickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone’s life. It can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), and lung problems, which can be fatal.
The overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.
Milder types of sickle cell disease may not impact life expectancy. People with sickle cell anaemia have a typical life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years of age. As newer treatments are developed, it’s hoped that the outlook will get better.
​Causes of sickle cell disease
Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. It isn’t something you can catch, and it’s not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy.
Inheriting sickle cell disease
You inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. Genes always come in pairs. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty.
This happens when both parents are “carriers” – they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait.
Carriers don’t have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition.
When both of a child’s parents are sickle cell carriers:
there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won’t inherit any faulty genes – they won’t have sickle cell disease, and they won’t be able to pass it on to their children
there’s a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier
there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they’re born
You can find more information about how sickle cell disease is inherited from the
Sickle Cell Society
.
Learn more about sickle cell carriers and screening
​Sickle cell disease carriers and screening
Sickle cell disease carriers are people who carry the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, but do not have the disease. This is also called having the sickle cell trait.
If you have the sickle cell trait, you won’t develop sickle cell disease. However, there’s a risk that you’ll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier.
Sickle cell disease carriers
The sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers.
You are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas :
Africa
Asia
The Caribbean
The Eastern Mediterranean
The Middle East
Most sickle cell carriers in the UK have an African or Caribbean family background – it’s estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier.
Finding out if you are a sickle cell carrier
You can request a blood test from your GP at any time to find out if you’re a sickle cell carrier. This is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene.
Both men and women are able to get the test.
Every pregnant woman in Scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. You can ask for a test even if your family background doesn’t suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. It’s a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too.
If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.
Read more about diagnosis and screening for the sickle cell disease gene here
Other health risks for sickle cell carriers
You’re not at risk of developing sickle cell disease if you carry sickle cell.
The only time you may be at risk of health problems is in rare cases where you might not get enough oxygen, such as:
having surgery under
general anaesthetic
– make sure your medical team know you carry sickle cell before your operation so they can ensure you get enough oxygen
during extreme sports such as deep sea diving and climbing at high altitudes – if you do sports like these, ensure you’re never short of oxygen
during regular, intensive physical activity – make sure you drink plenty of fluids during training and avoid extreme exhaustion
There’s also a very small risk of developing kidney problems associated with carrying sickle cell.
Apart from these uncommon situations, you can lead a completely normal and healthy life if you’re a sickle cell carrier.
Other blood disorders
Sickle cell carriers are also at risk of having a child with a blood disorder if their partner is a carrier of a different type of blood disorder.
You can find more detailed information about some of the other types of carrier in the following pages:

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/shingles/,"Shingles
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It’s caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox.
Symptoms of shingles
The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy
blisters
. These look like
chickenpox
.
Sometimes shingles causes symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash. This includes symptoms like:
a
headache
burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area
a feeling of being generally unwell
a high temperature (fever)
Shingles rash
The shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body. It develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve.
New blisters can appear for up to a week. A few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.
Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring.
Examples of the shingles rash
Shingles on the back
Shingles on the chest
Shingles on the face
Shingles on back of neck
Shingles pain
Most people with shingles experience a localised band of pain in the affected area.
The pain may be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.
Getting advice from a GP or pharmacist
Contact your GP practice if:
You haven’t had chickenpox before, you’ve been exposed to someone who has chickenpox or shingles and you:
are pregnant
have a weakened immune system (the body’s natural defence system)
are under 18 years old
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Speak to a pharmacist if:
you’re 18 years or over and have symptoms of shingles
If the pharmacist cannot treat you they may recommend you see your GP.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Causes of shingles
When you catch chickenpox the virus stays in your body. It can become active again later on if your immune system is lowered and cause shingles.
Your immune system can be lowered by things like:
stress
other illnesses or conditions
treatments like chemotherapy
It’s possible to have shingles more than once, but it’s very rare to get it more than twice.
Treating shingles
There’s no cure for shingles. But, there are ways to ease your symptoms until the condition improves.
Shingles symptoms usually get better in 2 to 4 weeks.
Speak to your GP or pharmacist as soon as you get symptoms of shingles. Early treatment may help to reduce the severity of the condition and complications.
Treating symptoms at home
Do
keep the rash as clean and dry as possible
wear loose-fitting clothing
use a cool damp cloth to soothe the skin and keep blisters clean
try calamine lotion to help relieve itching
Don’t
do not let dressings or plasters stick to the rash
do not use antibiotic cream – this slows healing
Other treatments for shingles
Your GP or pharmacist may recommend painkillers to ease discomfort caused by shingles. This includes:
paracetamol
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
like
ibuprofen
opioids – used for more severe pain
antidepressants
– used for severe pain
anticonvulsants – used for severe pain
Some people with shingles may also be prescribed antiviral tablets.
Preventing the spread of shingles
You can’t give shingles to other people. But, other people can catch chickenpox from you if they haven’t had it before.
If you have shingles, you’re contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over.
To help prevent the virus being passed on:
Don’t
do not share towels or flannels
do not go swimming
do not play contact sports
do not go work or school if your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and can’t be covered
Chickenpox
Chickenpox
can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid:
pregnant women who haven’t had chickenpox before
people with a weak immune system, for example someone with HIV or AIDS
babies less than 1 month old (unless it’s your own baby)
Complications of shingles
Complications can sometimes occur as a result of shingles. They are more likely if your immune system is low, (the body’s natural defence system), or are elderly.
Shingles is rarely life threatening. Complications, though, can mean that around 1 in every 1,000 cases in adults over the age of 70 is fatal.
Complications can include:
postherpetic neuralgia
eye problems
Ramsay Hunt syndrome
the rash becoming infected with bacteria
white patches (a loss of pigment) or scarring in the area of the rash
inflammation of the lungs
(pneumonia)
, liver (hepatitis), brain (encephalitis), spinal cord (transverse myelitis), or protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord
(meningitis)
– these complications are rare.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/shortness-of-breath/,"Shortness of breath
Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department.
It’s also one of the most common reasons people phone 999 for an ambulance.
It’s normal to get out of breath when you’ve overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it’s usually a warning sign of a medical condition.
The information below outlines the most common reasons for:
sudden shortness of breath
long-term shortness of breath
This guide shouldn’t be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what’s causing your breathlessness.
When to phone a doctor
You should phone your GP immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart.
Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is mild or the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit.
If you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while, don’t ignore it. See your GP as it’s likely you have a long-term condition, such as
obesity
,
asthma
or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
, which needs to be managed properly.
Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as:
Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually?
Did anything trigger it, such as exercise?
How bad is it? Does it only happen when you’ve been active, or when you’re not doing anything?
Is there any pain when you breathe?
Do you have a cough?
Do certain positions make it worse – for example, are you unable to lie down?
Feeling like you can’t get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed.
Causes of sudden shortness of breath
Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions.
A problem with your lungs or airways
Sudden breathlessness could be an
asthma
attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you’ll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You’ll feel breathless because it’s difficult to move air in and out of your airways.
Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness.
Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It’s usually caused by an infection, so you’ll need to take
antibiotics
.
If you have COPD, it’s likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.
A heart problem
It’s possible to have a “silent”
heart attack
without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety.
In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you’re having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they’ll give you
aspirin
and admit you to hospital straight away.
Heart failure
can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult.
A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness.
Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).
Panic attack or anxiety
A
panic attack
or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.
More unusual causes
These include:
a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis)
pneumothorax – partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs
pulmonary embolism – a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
– a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs
pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung
diabetic ketoacidosis – a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine
Causes of long-term breathlessness
Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by:
obesity
or being unfit
poorly controlled
asthma
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
– permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking
anaemia
– a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen)
heart failure
– when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly
a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate)
More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:
bronchiectasis
– a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough
pulmonary embolism – a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung
partial collapse of your lung caused by
lung cancer
pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung
narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body
frequent
panic attacks
, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/septic-shock/,"Septic shock
Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level after an infection.
Any type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare.
At first the infection can lead to a reaction called sepsis. This begins with:
weakness
chills
a rapid heart and breathing rate
Left untreated, toxins produced by bacteria can damage the small blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues.
This can affect your heart’s ability to pump blood to your organs, which lowers your blood pressure and means blood doesn’t reach vital organs, such as the brain and liver.
Phone 999 immediately if:
You think that you or someone in your care has symptoms of septic shock like:
low blood pressure (hypotension) that makes you feel dizzy when you stand up
a change in your mental state, like confusion or disorientation
diarrhoea
nausea and vomiting
cold, clammy and pale skin
Who is more at risk of developing septic shock?
People with a weakened
immune system
have an increased risk of developing septic shock.
This includes:
newborn babies
elderly people
pregnant women
people with long-term health conditions, such as
diabetes,
cirrhosis
or
kidney failure
people with lowered immune systems, such as those with
HIV or AIDS
or those receiving
chemotherapy
Treating septic shock
You’ll usually be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) so your body’s functions and organs can be supported while the infection is treated. In some cases treatment may start in the emergency department.
Treatment may include:
oxygen therapy
fluids given directly through a vein (intravenously)
medication to increase your blood flow
antibiotics
surgery (in some cases)
Oxygen therapy
To help you breathe more easily, you’ll be given oxygen through a face mask, a tube inserted into your nose, or an endotracheal tube inserted into your mouth. If you have severe
shortness of breath
, a mechanical ventilator may be used.
Increasing blood flow
You’ll probably be given fluids directly into a vein. This will help raise your blood pressure by increasing the amount of fluid in your blood.
To increase the blood flow to your vital organs, such as your brain, liver, kidneys and heart, you may be prescribed inotropic medicines or vasopressors.
Inotropic medicines
Inotropic medicines (inotropes), such as dobutamine, stimulate your heart. They increase the strength of your heartbeat, which helps get oxygen-rich blood to your tissues and organs, where it’s needed.
Vasopressors
Vasopressors include:
dopamine
adrenaline
noradrenaline
These medicines will cause your blood vessels to narrow, increasing your blood pressure and the flow of blood around your body. This will allow your vital organs to start functioning properly.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are often used to treat the associated bacterial infection. The type of antibiotic used depends on the type of bacterial infection and where in the body the infection started.
You may be started on antibiotics immediately to increase your chances of survival. Initially, two or three types of antibiotics may be used. The most effective type of antibiotic can be used once the bacterium responsible for the infection is identified.
Surgery
In severe cases of sepsis or septic shock, the large decrease in blood pressure and blood flow can kill organ tissue. If this happens, surgery may be required to remove the dead tissue.
Complications of septic shock
The chances of surviving septic shock will depend on:
the cause of infection
the number of organs that have failed
how soon treatment is started
Complications of septic shock can include:
inability of the lungs to take in enough oxygen (respiratory failure)
the heart not being able to pump enough blood around the body
(heart failure)
kidney failure
or injury
abnormal blood clotting
These are serious health conditions that will need to be treated urgently. Septic shock can be fatal because of complications like these."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/sinusitis/,"Sinusitis
Sinusitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the sinuses. The sinuses are small, air-filled spaces in your cheekbones and forehead. Inflammation blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual.
Sinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection. It’s common and usually gets better within 2 to 3 weeks.
Symptoms of sinusitis
Sinusitis usually occurs after an infection, such as a
cold
.
Symptoms of sinusitis include:
a green or yellow discharge from your nose
a blocked nose
pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or more
toothache
a reduced sense of smell
bad breath (halitosis)
Children with sinusitis may:
be irritable
breathe through their mouth
have difficulty feeding
sound nasal when they speak, as though they have a stuffy cold
The symptoms of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis). Occasionally they can last 3 months or more (chronic sinusitis).
When to get medical advice
If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you can often treat sinusitis without seeing a GP.
Speak to your GP practice if:
your symptoms are severe or getting worse
your symptoms haven’t started to improve after around 7 to 10 days
you keep getting sinusitis
Diagnosing sinusitis
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the inside of your nose.
If you keep getting sinusitis, or its severe, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
Treatment for sinusitis
Sinusitis usually gets better on its own within 2 or 3 weeks.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
Do
get plenty of rest
drink plenty of fluids
take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or
ibuprofen
(do not give aspirin to children under 16)
use nasal
decongestants
– these shouldn’t be used for more than a week, as this might make things worse
hold warm packs to your face
clean your nose with a salt water solution – you can make yourself or buy sachets from a pharmacy
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child,
speak to a pharmacist
for advice.
How to clean your nose with a homemade salt water solution
Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool.
Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water.
Wash your hands.
Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it.
Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat.
Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day until your nose feels more comfortable.
You do not need to use all of the solution, but make a fresh solution each time you clean your nose.
Treatments from your doctor
If your symptoms aren’t improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe
antibiotics
tablets or
corticosteroid
spray or drops.
If your symptoms still don’t get better, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses.
What causes sinusitis?
Sinusitis is usually caused by a
cold
or
flu
virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses.
An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.
Chronic sinusitis
It’s not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it may be related to:
allergies
and related conditions, including allergic rhinitis,
asthma
and
hay fever
nasal polyps (benign growths inside the nose)
smoking
a weakened immune system
Controlling underlying conditions like allergies may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis."

About Sjogren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s (pronounced Show-grin’s) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body’s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands.
The effects of Sjögren’s syndrome can be widespread. Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome, which are dry eyes and
dry mouth
.
In women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness.
Read more about the
symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome
What causes Sjögren’s syndrome?
Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue.
In Sjögren’s syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands, and other secretory glands throughout the body.
The reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it’s triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors.
Some people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they’re born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system.
Read more about the
causes of Sjögren’s syndrome
Healthcare professionals classify Sjögren’s syndrome as being either:
primary – when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition
secondary – when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as
lupus
or
rheumatoid arthritis
Diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it.
Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and carry out a test to see how dry your mouth and eyes are.
Read more about
diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome
Treating Sjögren’s syndrome
There is no cure for Sjögren’s syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms.
Dry eyes and mouth can usually be helped with artificial tears and saliva.
It’s important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as corneal ulcers and
tooth decay
.
In severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended.
Read more about
treating Sjögren’s syndrome
Complications of Sjögren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn’t treated.
Sjögren’s syndrome also increases your risk of developing
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
, which is a cancer of the lymph glands. However, the chances are still low, at around 5%.
Women with Sjögren’s syndrome have an increased risk of having children with a temporary “lupus” rash or heart abnormalities. Any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems.

Who’s affected by Sjögren’s syndrome?
Sjögren’s syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases.
It’s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don’t see their GP about their symptoms.

Information about you
If you have Sjögren’s syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Symptoms of Sjogren’s syndrome
The most commonly reported symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms.
However, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have Sjögren’s syndrome.
Many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful.
Associated symptoms of dry mouth
A
dry mouth
can lead to:
tooth decay
and
gum disease
dry
cough
difficulty swallowing and chewing
hoarse voice
difficulty speaking
swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears)
repeated fungal infections in the mouth (
oral thrush
) – symptoms of which can include a coated or white tongue
Associated symptoms of dry eyes
Dry eyes can lead to:
burning or stinging eyes
itchy eyes
a feeling that there’s grit in your eyes
irritated and swollen eyelids
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
tired eyes
mucus discharge from your eyes
These symptoms can get worse when you’re:
in a windy or smoky environment
in an air-conditioned building
travelling on aeroplane
Other symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome
In more serious cases of Sjögren’s syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as:
dry skin
tiredness and fatigue – which are common and can lead to total exhaustion
muscle pain
joint pain, stiffness and swelling
vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)
difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning
Causes of Sjogren’s syndrome
It’s not known exactly what causes Sjögren’s syndrome, but it’s thought to be linked to a problem with the immune system.
The immune system
Your immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill.
An autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body’s healthy cells and tissue.
In Sjögren’s syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands.
The antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There’s some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness.
The immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs.
Possible triggers for Sjögren’s syndrome
Primary Sjögren’s syndrome
Most researchers believe that primary Sjögren’s syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Certain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly.
The female hormone oestrogen also seems to play a role. Sjögren’s syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of the
menopause
, when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness could make the condition more noticeable.
Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
or
lupus
. This is known as secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.
The exocrine glands
Your saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome can be widespread and troublesome.
The importance of tears
We usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film.
Tears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They:
lubricate the eye
keep the eye clean and free of dust
protect the eye against infection
help stabilise your vision
The importance of saliva
Saliva also serves several important functions, including:
keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated
aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches
acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)
Diagnosing Sjogren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions.
You may see different health professionals for your different symptoms, such as a dentist for a
dry mouth
, an optician for dry eyes and a gynaecologist for a dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis.
See your GP if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth.
Screening questions
Experts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you’re worried you may have Sjögren’s syndrome.
If you answer “yes” to most of the questions below, you may have Sjögren’s syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests.
Have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months?
Do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye?
Do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day?
Have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months?
Do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)?
Do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food?
Further testing
Tests used to diagnose Sjögren’s syndrome include:
tear break-up time and Schirmer tests
a lip biopsy
blood tests
salivary flow rate
These are explained below.
Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests
Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions).
The tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are. A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate.
This test is also carried out using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely.
In the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears.
Lip biopsy
During a lip
biopsy
, a small tissue sample is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A
local anaesthetic
is injected into the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands.
Clusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sjögren’s syndrome.
Blood tests
Blood tests
are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sjögren’s syndrome.
These antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sjögren’s syndrome, so it’s possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition.
Salivary flow rate
A salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce.
You’ll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sjögren’s syndrome.
Treating Sjogren’s syndrome
There’s no cure for Sjögren’s syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness.
Sjögren’s syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be tailored to suit you.
Eye care
Artificial tears
Mild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing “artificial tears” – a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription.
There are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you’re using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn’t contain preservatives. This is because there’s evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye.
A short-term dose of eye drops containing
corticosteroids
may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However, long-term corticosteroid use isn’t recommended because they can cause serious side effects.
To minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you’ll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.
Moisture chamber spectacles
Wearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants.
Some people used to be embarrassed to wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses.
Punctal plugs
Punctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep the eye better protected by tears.
Temporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used.
Mouth care
Looking after your mouth
A number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including:
maintaining good oral hygiene to
prevent tooth decay
and
gum disease
increasing your fluid intake
using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production
sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness
regularly using mouth rinses to soothe your mouth and protect it against infection
If you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates.
Read more about
how to stop smoking
Saliva substitutes
There are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don’t replicate the role of saliva in preventing infection, so you’ll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene.
Saliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you.
Medication for Sjögren’s syndrome
Pilocarpine
The medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the
symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth
. Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears.
Side effects of pilocarpine include:
hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
nausea
diarrhoea
heartburn
abdominal (stomach) pain
an increased need to go to the toilet
For some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits.
Don’t take pilocarpine if you have
asthma
or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
, or if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.
Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system’s attack on the tear and saliva glands. It can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness.
You’ll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment.
Side effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include:
nausea
skin rash
loss of appetite
stomach cramps
vomiting
In very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. You’ll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. Regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment.
Hydroxychloroquine shouldn’t be used by breastfeeding women.
Treating other symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome
Dry skin
Several soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you.
Vaginal dryness
Vaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
.
Muscle and joint pains
Muscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
, such as
ibuprofen
. If this doesn’t work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription.
NSAIDs can increase your risk of developing
stomach ulcers
and internal bleeding, particularly if they’re taken on a long-term basis.
If you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that’s rubbed into affected joints.
NSAIDs aren’t recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions.
General advice
These simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sjögren’s syndrome:
have a dental check-up every six months
practise good dental hygiene – brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly
avoid eating too many sweet foods
avoid strong and perfumed soaps – use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist
avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible
avoid drinking too much
alcohol
Complications of Sjogren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome isn’t usually life-threatening, but it is linked to more seriousproblems.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
It’s estimated that people with Sjögren’s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
than people without the condition.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a
cancer
of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) that are spread throughout your body, much like your blood vessels.
While this increased risk may sound alarming, the chance of a person with Sjögren’s syndrome developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is still small, as it only affects around 5% of people with the syndrome.
However, if you have Sjögren’s syndrome, you should be aware of the main early symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland) – usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Report any swollen lymph nodes to your GP.
Eye damage
If dry eyes aren’t treated, they can become inflamed and you can develop ulcers on the surface of your eyes (corneal ulcers).
If left untreated, corneal ulcers can lead to loss of vision and permanent sight damage.
Pregnancy
If you’re planning to become pregnant and have Sjögren’s syndrome, ask your GP to test for certain antibodies that may be present in Sjögren’s syndrome and are known to cause a temporary
lupus
rash in newborn babies. In very rare cases, the antibodies can also cause heart defects in babies.
If these antibodies are found, there should be no reason why you can’t continue with the pregnancy, but your child may need additional specialist care during pregnancy and after the birth.

antenatal appointments
Other conditions
A number of other conditions have been linked to Sjögren’s syndrome, including:
peripheral neuropathy
– a condition that often involves loss of sensation in the hands and feet
Raynaud’s phenomenon – restricted blood flow to the hands, which can cause them to feel cold, numb and painful
kidney problems – such as inflammation or
kidney stones
an
underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
– which can lead to tiredness and weight gain
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
– which can cause
abdominal pain
and irregular bowel movements
teeth cavities"

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/soft-tissue-sarcomas/,"Soft tissue sarcomas
Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs.
Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments.
Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms and the trunk (torso).
There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example:
leiomyosarcomas – which develop in muscle tissue
liposarcomas – which develop in fat tissue
angiosarcomas – which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels
gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) – which can develop in the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system
Soft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK.
What causes soft tissue sarcomas?
Cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.
In the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it’s unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including:
age – soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older
certain genetic conditions – some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas
previous
radiotherapy
– some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment
exposure to certain chemicals – exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas
One particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called
Kaposi’s sarcoma
– which develops in skin cells – is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with
HIV
).
Signs and symptoms
As soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms.
For example, a tumour near the stomach may cause
abdominal (tummy) pain
, a feeling of fullness and
constipation
, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a
cough
or
breathlessness
.
There are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can’t easily be moved around and gets bigger over time.
You should speak to your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently.
Although it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out.
Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas
If your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
A diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of:
a
biopsy
– where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory
imaging tests – a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out
If a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the ‘stage’) and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the ‘grade’).
Treating soft tissue sarcomas
If you’re diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment.
Treatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health.
The main treatments used are:
surgery – to remove any tumours
radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy
– where medication is used to kill cancer cells
Surgery
Surgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage.
It involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind.
Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part.
But there is a possibility you’ll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage.
In a small number of cases, there may be no option but to
amputate
the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area.
Radiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible.
Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.
Read more about the
side effects of radiotherapy
Chemotherapy
Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously).
Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed.
Chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body’s cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
Outlook
As with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed.
If the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured.
But you’ll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and
occupational therapy
to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery.
A cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/stillbirth/,"Stillbirth
A stillbirth is when a baby dies after the 24th week of a pregnancy or during birth.
It’s a devastating experience for parents and can affect you and your family in ways you don’t expect.
How you might be feeling
Your emotions will likely be in turmoil and you might feel angry, guilty, sad and lonely but also love and pride. There’s no right or wrong way to feel.
If you already have children, think about how they might be feeling too and what support they’ll need.
This is a very difficult time for you and everyone close to you so it’s important to support each other and ask for help if you need it.
Causes of stillbirth
The stillbirth or death of a newborn baby can happen for lots of reasons and doctors don’t yet know all the causes.
Some are linked to problems with the placenta or mum’s health and others to the baby’s health or development but in some cases the reason can’t be explained.
Although there are many reasons that a stillbirth can happen, you can decrease the risk by maintaining a health lifestyle before and during pregnancy.
Read more about living a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy
Death during pregnancy
If your baby dies before birth, labour is usually induced. Going through labour and giving birth is the safest option for most women, even though it can be very distressing.
It’s natural to want to know why this happened. It’s not always possible to know why your baby died and that can be hard to come to terms with.
Your midwife and obstetrician will be there to support you through it. They will tell you what to expect and give you whatever help you need.
Should I hold my baby?
Your midwife or doctor will ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby. You might want to involve other members of your family too.
If you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Many parents find it comforting to see, touch and hold their baby and, if you want to, you can bath and dress them.
Cuddle cot
Your midwife can talk to you about a Cuddle Cot, a special cooling mattress inside a cot which can let you spend more time with your baby in the hospital or at home.
This gives you more time to say goodbye, with the support of family and friends.
If the hospital doesn’t have a Cuddle Cot then there are other organisations that can organise one for bereaved parents. Ask your midwife.
After a stillbirth
What you choose to do is very personal and individual, as is the way you grieve.
Specialist help and support is available for parents and families who have lost a baby and your midwife, family nurse and health visitor can help you to find the right support locally.
Registering a stillbirth
Your baby’s stillbirth must be registered. Your midwife and the hospital staff can advise you how to do this.
You can’t officially register a baby lost before 24 weeks of pregnancy, but some hospitals will give you a certificate in memory of your baby if you ask.
More about
registering the death of a baby
Funeral arrangements
You’ll need time to think what you’d like for your baby’s funeral. This could be a burial or cremation with a service in the style of your choice. Take as much time as you need to decide on the right way to say goodbye.
All hospitals in Scotland will offer a funeral service for your baby free of charge or you may choose to make your own private arrangements, which can give you more choice and control.
More about
funeral arrangements
Coping with the loss of a baby
Everyone reacts differently to the loss of a baby. Your emotions might be overwhelming and you might feel physically drained too.
Take time to rest and look after yourself. It’s important to know you are not alone and have done nothing wrong.
More about
coping with the loss of a baby
Post-mortem
If you lost your baby after 13 weeks, you’ll be offered a post-mortem (autopsy). This is a medical investigation to try to understand what happened and find out if there are issues that could affect a future pregnancy
Whether or not to have a post-mortem can be a difficult decision and you’ll be given support and time to think it over. If you have questions or worries, ask the person who discusses the post-mortem with you.
Recovering from a stillbirth
You will need care from your midwife and doctor to make sure your body is recovering. Your midwife will assist you through all the decisions you need to make and help you to find the right support.
You don’t have to manage alone and it can sometimes help to talk with others who have been through baby loss. You, your baby’s father or your partner and your family are likely to need time to grieve.
Remembering your baby
Some parents find it helps to do something to remember their baby, like:
creating a space in their garden
saying a prayer
writing a poem
Others keep photographs, handprints or footprints, or locks of their baby’s hair in a memory box. No matter what stage of pregnancy your loss is, you can make a memory box – ask your midwife about this. Some hospitals give special boxes to parents just for this.
Some parents don’t want to do any of these things, and that’s okay too. There’s no right or wrong way.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/spleen-problems-and-spleen-removal/,"Spleen problems and spleen removal
Some people are born without a spleen or need to have it removed because of disease or injury.
The spleen is a fist-sized organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs.
It’s an important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen’s functions.
What does the spleen do?
The spleen has a few important functions.
It fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells).
It controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots).
It screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells.
If the spleen doesn’t work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. This can lead to:
anaemia
, from a reduced number of red blood cells
an increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells
bleeding or bruising, from a reduced number of platelets
Spleen problems
Spleen pain
Spleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area. This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.
A damaged or ruptured spleen
The spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen, car accident, sporting accident or fracture to the ribs.
Rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.
Signs of a ruptured spleen are:
pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area
dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)
Sometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder.
A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding.
Go straight to A&E if:
you think you’ve ruptured or damaged your spleen
Enlarged spleen
The spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such as
cirrhosis
, leukaemia or
rheumatoid arthritis
.
An enlarged spleen doesn’t always cause symptoms. Otherwise, look out for:
feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach)
feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs
anaemia
and/or fatigue
frequent infections
easy bleeding
Doctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test,
CT scan
or
MRI scan
would confirm the diagnosis.
The spleen is not usually removed if it’s just enlarged. Instead, you’ll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. Antibiotics may be prescribed if there’s an infection.
You’ll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you’ll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged.
Surgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can’t be found.
Splenectomy (having the spleen removed)
An operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged.
It may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed – a partial splenectomy.
If there’s time, you’ll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation.
Laparoscopy
Most splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery).
A laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with its own light source. It is attached to a camera and will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a TV screen to guide the surgeon’s instruments.
Laparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. However, you will still need a general anaesthetic.
The procedure involves:
making several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area)
guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they’re doing
passing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen – gas will be pumped into your abdomen to make this easier
The incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together. You may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.
Open surgery
Open surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be removed via keyhole surgery. Often, in emergencies, this will be the preferred method to rapidly control bleeding.
You’ll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover.
Afterwards
It’s normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you’ll be given pain relief medication.
You should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation.
Like any operation, a splenectomy carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection.
Your doctor will run through these risks with you.
You should be given breathing and leg movement exercises to do at home, to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection.
Another risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection, contact your GP or hospital immediately, as you may need antibiotics.
Recovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving.
Living without a spleen
If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen’s functions.
This means you will still be able to cope with most infections. However, there is a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly. This risk will be present for the rest of your life.
Risk of infection
Young children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small. The risk is also increased if you have a medical condition such as
sickle cell anaemia
,
coeliac disease
or a condition that affects your immune system, such as
HIV
.
This risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection.
Vaccinations
Read about
vaccinations for children and adults without a fully working spleen.
Antibiotics
It’s recommended that you take low-dose
antibiotics
for the rest of your life to prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotics are particularly important:
for children under the age of 16
for the first 2 years after your spleen is removed
if your immune system doesn’t work properly
Be alert for signs of infection
Watch out for signs of infection, such as:
high temperature (fever)
sore throat
cough
severe headache
headache with drowsiness or a rash
abdominal pain
redness and swelling around the surgical wound
Your GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to use if you get an infection. You should start taking them at the first sign of an infection, so see your GP as soon as possible.
If your infection becomes serious, you will be admitted to hospital.
Animal and tick bites
Bites from animals
and ticks (small blood-sucking parasites) can cause infections.
If you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics and seek medical advice urgently.
If you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of babesiosis, which is a rare disease transmitted by ticks. Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers. If you become ill, get medical advice straight away.
Telling medical staff about your condition
Healthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you don’t have a working spleen. However, always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist.
Carry medical ID
It’s a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID. For example:
if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you
you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant
If you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert the staff to your condition.
Travel abroad

travelling abroad without a fully working spleen.
Scars

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/slapped-cheek-syndrome/,"Slapped cheek syndrome
Slapped cheek syndrome (also called fifth disease or parvovirus B19) is a viral infection. It’s most common in children but it can affect people of any age. It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks.
Slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in 1 to 3 weeks. Once you’ve had the infection, you’re usually immune to it for life.
However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you’re pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice.
Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome
Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4 to 14 days after becoming infected. Sometimes, symptoms may not appear for up to 21 days.
First symptoms
Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won’t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days:
a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38°C (100.4°F)
a runny nose
a
sore throat
a
headache
an upset stomach
feeling generally unwell
The infection is most contagious during this initial period.
Adults may also feel joint pain and stiffness. This may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed.
Slapped cheek rash
Image source:
dermnetnz.org
After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (‘slapped cheeks’) normally appears. Adults may not get this.
By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious.
After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy.
The rashes will normally fade within a week or two. Occasionally, the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress.
When to get medical advice
You don’t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome as it normally gets better on its own.
Speak to your GP practice if:
You’ve been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek syndrome or you have symptoms of the infection and:
you’re pregnant – there’s a very small risk of
miscarriage
or other complications
you have a blood disorder, such as
sickle cell anaemia
or thalassaemia
you have a weakened immune system
ask for an urgent appointment if you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin,
shortness of breath
, extreme tiredness or fainting
If your GP is closed, phone
111
.
In these cases, a
blood test
may be carried out to see if you’re immune to the infection. If you’re not immune, you’ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems.
If you develop severe anaemia, it’s likely that you’ll be sent to hospital for a
blood transfusion
.
What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome
Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment.
If you or your child is feeling unwell, there are things you can do help ease the symptoms.
Do
rest
drink plenty of fluids – babies should continue their normal feeds
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
for a high temperature, headaches or joint pain – children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin
use an emollient (moisturising lotion) on itchy skin
speak to a pharmacist about itchy skin – they can recommend the best antihistamine for children
Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, you do not have to stay away from work or school once the rash has developed. The infection is no longer contagious by this point.
Let your child’s school know if your child has slapped cheek syndrome.
How do you get slapped cheek syndrome?
Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection.
The virus is spread in a similar way to
colds
and
flu
. You can become infected by:
inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection
touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose
Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on.
Preventing slapped cheek syndrome
It’s very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome. This is because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms.
Make sure that everyone you live with washes their hands often to help stop the infection from spreading.
There’s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition."

About melanoma
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.
The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.
In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.
An ‘ABCDE checklist’ has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.
Read more about the
symptoms of melanoma
.
These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK.
Nodular melanoma
Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren’t regularly exposed to the sun.
Lentigo maligna melanoma
Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.
Acral lentiginous melanoma
Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.
Cancer Research UK has more information about the
different types of melanoma
.
Why does melanoma happen?
Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It’s thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.
Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having:
lots of moles or freckles
pale skin that burns easily
red or blonde hair
a family member who has had melanoma
Read more about the
causes of melanoma
.
Diagnosing melanoma
Speak to your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.
In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a
biopsy
.
You may also have a test to check if the melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a sentinel node biopsy.
Read more about
diagnosing melanoma
.
How is melanoma treated?
The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances.
If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful.
If melanoma isn’t diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as
chemotherapy
.
Read more about
treating melanoma
.
Once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe.
If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns.
Who is affected
Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK.
More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It’s also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds.
Can melanoma be prevented?
Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light.
You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.
Regularly checking your moles and freckles can help lead to early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.
Symptoms of melanoma
The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.
Normal moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and no bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.
Signs to look out for include a mole that is:
getting bigger
changing shape
changing colour
bleeding or becoming crusty
itchy or painful
A helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:
Asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape
Border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border
Colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours
Diameter – melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Enlargement or elevation – a mole that changes size over time is more likely to be a melanoma
Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.
In rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination.

Cancer Research UK:
Melanoma symptoms
Causes of melanoma
Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.
Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light:
ultraviolet A (UVA)
ultraviolet B (UVB)
ultraviolet C (UVC)
UVC is filtered out by the Earth’s atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer.
Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.
Repeated
sunburn
, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages.
Moles
You are at an increased risk of melanoma if you have lots of moles on your body, especially if they are large (over 5mm) or unusually shaped.
Having just 1 unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%.
For this reason, it’s important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun.
Family history
Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.
Increased risk
Certain things are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:
pale skin that does not tan easily
red or blonde hair
blue eyes
older age
a large number of freckles
an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment
a condition that suppresses your immune system – such as
HIV
medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used after organ transplants
exposure to certain chemicals – such as creosote and arsenic
a previous diagnosis of skin cancer
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK: Melanoma risks and causes.
Diagnosing melanoma
A diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin. Your GP will refer you to a specialist if they suspect melanoma.
Some GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.
As melanoma is a relatively rare condition, many GPs will only see a case every few years. It’s important to monitor your moles and return to your GP if you notice any changes. Taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis.
Seeing a specialist
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected malignant melanoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
You will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within 2 weeks of seeing your GP.
The dermatologist or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may also remove the mole and send it for testing (
biopsy
) to check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under
local anaesthetic
, meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won’t feel any pain.
If cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area of skin.
Further tests
Further tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy
If melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes). Lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under
general anaesthetic
.
A combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider area of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma.
The first lymph node this reaches is known as the ‘sentinel’ lymph node. The surgeon can locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma (this process can take several weeks).
If the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it’s extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it’s more likely to spread elsewhere.
If the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma.
Your surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but is used to investigate the outlook of your condition.
An operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.
Other tests you may have include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
a positron emission tomography (PET) scan
blood tests

Treating melanoma
Melanoma stages
Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. The type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached.
The melanoma stages can be described as:
stage 0 – the melanoma is on the surface of the skin
stage 1A – the melanoma is less than 1mm thick
stage 1B – the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity)
stage 2A – the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick and is ulcerated
stage 2B – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick and ulcerated
stage 2C – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated
stage 3A – the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further
stage 3B – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes
stage 3C – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby
stage 4 – the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin

Cancer Research UK:

Cancer Research UK:
Stages of melanoma
Macmillan:
Melanoma
Stage 1 melanoma
Treating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it – this is known as surgical excision.
Surgical excision is usually carried out under
local anaesthetic
. This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won’t feel pain. In some cases,
general anaesthetic
is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure.
If a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method.
Once the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. You will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.
Stage 2 and 3 melanoma
As with stage 1 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed. The remaining skin is either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be carried out if necessary.
Sentinel node biopsy
Sentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead with the procedure and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma.
If the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.
Lymph nodes
If the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. Your doctor will have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration). Removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic.
While the surgeon will try to ensure the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as
lymphoedema
.
Follow-up
Once the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning.
You may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma returning. This is called adjuvant treatment. There is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial.
Stage 4 melanoma
It may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has:
been diagnosed at its most advanced stage
spread to another part of your body (metastasis)
come back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer)
Treatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer’s growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy.
You may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site.
You may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. These include:
radiotherapy
drug treatments
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
may be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma.
Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend.
The side effects of radiotherapy include:
tiredness
nausea
loss of appetite
hair loss
sore skin
Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. After treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK:
Radiotherapy for melanoma
.
Drug treatment
In recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. The medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics.
The medications currently being used include:
vemurafenib
ipilimumab
nivolumab
However, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. Your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer. It is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma.
Several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable.
Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. Chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover.
The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.
Electrochemotherapy
Electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. It may be considered if:
surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked
radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t worked
The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.
These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed).
Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.
It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.
Your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.
Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on
Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body’s immune system to work against the melanoma. Two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma).
Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.
Vaccines
There is ongoing research into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back.
Vaccines are designed to focus the body’s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months.
As more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.
Monoclonal antibodies
Our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn’t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body.
Antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.
Ipilimumab
Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer.
In December 2012, NICE recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.
Signalling inhibitors
Signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK.
There are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials.
NICE recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.

Clinical trials
All new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial.
A clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process.
There are a few key things to know about clinical trials:
overall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely
all clinical trials are highly regulated
all new treatments will first become available through clinical trials
even where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients
If you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Deciding against treatment for stage 4 melanoma
Many of the treatments described have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life. You may decide against having treatment if it is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy, or if you do not have symptoms causing you pain or discomfort.
This is entirely your decision and your healthcare team will respect it. If you decide not to receive treatment, pain relief and nursing care will be made available when you need it. This is called
palliative care
.

Living with a soft tissue sarcoma
Introduction
This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma.
There are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. The information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. These are the most common types in teenagers. If you have a different type and want to know more, contact
Macmillan
.
If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general
soft tissue sarcoma
section.
Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:
rhabdomyosarcomas
synovial sarcomas
soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma
fibrosarcomas
Sarcomas can also develop in the bones. This is called osteosarcoma.
Signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas
The symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is:
if it’s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb – this is usually painless, but not always
if it’s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation)
if it’s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to pee (pass urine), and having blood in your pee
if it’s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest
if it’s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit
You may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss.
Remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have a sarcoma.  But if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to speak to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.
Causes
It’s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.
People often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.
Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.

This type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.
There are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.
To find out more look at Macmillan’s
rhabdomyosarcoma
information that is written for all ages.
Synovial Sarcoma
This type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.
Soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma
If you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone. You can read more about this in Macmillan’s
bone cancer
section.
Fibrosarcoma
This type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together – like your muscles to bones. You’re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.

soft tissue sarcoma
information.
The soft tissue
The soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. Soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels.
Types of soft tissue sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body.
There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:
rhabdomyosarcomas
synovial sarcomas
fibrosarcomas
There are also bone sarcomas.
Doctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that’s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope.
Rhabdomyosarcomas
These develop from muscle and the surrounding tissue. There are 2 main types that affect younger people:
alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in teenagers and young adults and are usually found in an arm or leg (limb), or in the muscles of the chest or tummy (abdomen)
embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in children and can start in a number of areas, for example, around the eye, where the throat joins with the nose, the bladder, the womb, or the vagina
Synovial sarcomas
These usually develop near to but not inside joints, such as the knee or elbow. But they can develop anywhere in the body. They usually appear as hard lumps.
Fibrosarcomas
These start in cells called fibrocytes, which form the tissue that helps join parts of our body together, such as joining the muscles to the bones. Fibrosarcomas are usually found in the arms, legs or torso, but can also start in areas deeper in the body.
The information in this section covers the common types of soft tissue sarcoma, but if you have a different one and want to know more, please contact
Macmillan
.
Causes
It’s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.
Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.
Some rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. You would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions.
People who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life – this would be from their teens onwards.
People often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.
If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general
soft tissue sarcoma
information.
Tests for soft tissue sarcomas
There are some tests you might have at your GP surgery or at the hospital. These tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.
Visiting your GP
If you think you might have some of the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma, you should go to your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms, and they can arrange tests to find out more.
They’ll examine you and usually arrange for some tests, such as X-rays. There may be a number of reasons why you’re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can’t find the cause, you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.
At the hospital
To begin with, you may see a specialist at a general hospital for more tests. If your GP suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist.
If you’re diagnosed with a sarcoma and you’re not already seeing a specialist, you’ll be referred to one. You’ll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff.
Your hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests, which Macmillan have information on:
X-rays
bone scans
ultrasound scans
MRI
,
CT
or
PET
scans
biopsies
bone marrow tests
You won’t necessarily need all of these tests.
Further tests
If the tests show that you have a sarcoma, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. Macmillan have information on these, including:
blood tests
tests to check your heart is healthy, including an
echocardiogram
or
electrocardiogram (ECG),
or a nuclear medicine scan (MUGA scan)
tests to check your kidneys are healthy, which can involve blood tests or having your wee (urine) collected for a period of time or a nuclear medicine blood test (GFR)
This may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.
Having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends and your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.

Treating soft tissue sarcomas
This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about treatment for a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. There are different types of soft tissue sarcoma, and the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and fibrosarcomas, which are the most common types in teenagers.
If you have a different type and want to know more, please
contact Macmillan
.
The 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Most people have a combination of treatments. Your doctors will plan your treatment based on:
the type of sarcoma you have
the stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started)
the grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are).
If you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They’ll be happy to help you understand what’s involved.
If you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone.
Chemotherapy
This is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations:
before surgery – to shrink the tumour
after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread
when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation
For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line. You can find out more about
chemotherapy
and how it’s given.
You’ll have chemotherapy over a few days, then you’ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy.
You’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy, but it’s often possible to have part of your treatment as an outpatient.
Different chemotherapy drugs are used for soft tissue sarcomas, and you’ll usually have 2 or 3 drugs in combination. This is sometimes called a regimen or treatment plan. Your doctor will decide which regimen or treatment plan is best for you depending on the grade and stage of your sarcoma. You may have chemotherapy treatment as part of a clinical research trial. It will be your decision whether or not you take part in a trial. Your doctor will explain it fully before you make the choice if there is a trial that is right for you.
Some of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are:
ifosfamide
vincristine
actinomycin D
doxorubicin
cyclophosphamide
cisplatin
If you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. Giving these drugs together is called IVA.
You might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. Giving these drugs together is called IVADO.
Macmillan have more information about
chemotherapy
, including information about
individual drugs
and
combinations of drugs
, IVA and IVADO chemotherapy. This is written for anyone who’s looking for information about chemotherapy, not just for young adults.
Other types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you’re going to have and how many cycles you’ll need.
Side effects
Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It’s hard to know how it’s going to be for you, as everyone is different. The most common are hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.
Side effects can often be controlled, so always let your doctor or nurse know about the side effects you’re having. They can usually do something to improve them. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.
If you want to know more about the type of chemotherapy you’re having and its side effects, there’s lots more information in Macmillan’s
chemotherapy section
.
Surgery
Surgery to remove the cancer is one of the main treatments for soft tissue sarcomas. Your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, and at the same time reduce any long-term effects as much as possible.
The operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. You might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. Everyone is different. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what’s involved. Below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma.
We also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section.
Wide local excision
You may have an operation called a wide local excision to remove the cancer and an area of tissue surrounding it (called the margin). This tissue is checked to make sure it doesn’t contain any cancer cells. Sometimes the surgeon also removes some of the lymph nodes (glands) near the cancer to find out if there are any cancer cells there. If there are cancer cells in the margin or lymph nodes, some people may need to have more surgery.
Skin graft or soft tissue graft
If you need to have a large area of tissue removed, you may need to have a skin graft or soft tissue graft. This is when skin and sometimes muscle is taken from a different part of the body to place over the area where the sarcoma was removed from. This is called plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery. It’s done to give you as natural an appearance as possible and to make sure you can still do the things you did before your operation. Both operation sites will gradually heal over a few weeks after the operation.
Limb-sparing surgery
If the sarcoma is in an arm or leg you may have limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon takes away the cancer without removing the arm or leg. You’ll have all of the tumour taken away from your limb, as well as any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.
The surgeon then replaces what they’ve taken away. This may involve using plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery (see skin graft or soft tissue graft) to replace the tissue that’s been removed, or it may involve surgery to replace any bone that’s been removed. If you need to have bone removed, the surgeon replaces it with a specially designed metal implant called an endoprosthesis.
If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, your joint can be replaced with an artificial one.
Before the operation
Your physiotherapist might give you exercises before your operation to strengthen your muscles.
If you’ve had chemotherapy, you’ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover from the treatment before you can have your operation. Doctors will check that your blood count has returned to normal. They’ll also make sure that you’re well enough to have the operation. If you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You’ll probably also see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to do to strengthen your muscles.
If you want to have a look at the endoprosthesis that will be put in during your surgery, your nurse or surgeon can usually arrange this.
After the operation
You’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it still and let it heal.
You’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days or when there isn’t very much fluid coming out of the wound.
You won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein.
You’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 to 3 days. As time goes on you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. Be honest about how you are feeling to your doctors and nurses and they can make sure that you are comfortable and as pain-free as possible.
Once you’re home you’ll probably feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems it’s important to get them treated right away, as a delay could mean they get much more serious.
If your new joint starts to stiffen up you may need some more physiotherapy, so tell your doctor so they can arrange this for you.
If you notice any new redness, soreness or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s really important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.
There’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on
living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma
.
Amputation
Very occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. This is called an amputation and it’s only ever done if there is no alternative.
Before the operation
Your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and you might want to talk to a specialist nurse or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who has had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It’s really important to get support.
After the operation
You’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a drain coming from the wound to remove any excess fluid that builds up. The drain is usually taken out by a nurse on the ward after 3 to 4 days or when there is no fluid coming from the wound. You’ll also be given fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.
You’ll probably feel a bit sore after your operation, especially for the first 2 to 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the doctors and nurses if you need extra pain relief. You may have pain that feels as if it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as phantom pain. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.
A physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.
If you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.
Once you’re up and around you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.
It’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis (artificial limb) until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and you’ll start learning how to use it in physiotherapy. A specialist team will help you recover from the operation and get you used to the artificial limb that you’re fitted with.
You’ll be able to go home about two weeks after your operation.
You can read more about recovering after the operation in our information about
living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma
.
Remember that it may be possible to talk to someone who has been through the same as you. Your doctor or nurse can arrange this.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. There’s more information about it in the
radiotherapy
section.
For soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations:
after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you’ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed
before surgery – to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation
when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation
Radiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday). Each treatment takes a few minutes.
Side effects
Radiotherapy isn’t painful, but it can cause some side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.
Other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.

soft tissue sarcoma
information.
Living with a soft tissue sarcoma
This information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. You may find it useful to read the information about surgery first.
Life after limb-sparing surgery
The long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon.
After limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.
Joint replacements
If you’ve had a joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint. Check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do.
If you’ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. After any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. It’s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible.
Life after amputation
After amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.
Different types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.
How will I feel?
You might feel lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. You might think you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it’s important that you get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:
family or friends
a counsellor – this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse
other young people in a similar situation
Things will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available.
Other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with, too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.
Try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. You might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind.

About non-melanoma skin cancer
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.
The term ‘non-melanoma’ distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as
melanoma
, which spreads faster in the body.
The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn’t heal after a few weeks.
In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly.
Speak to your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure.
Read more about the
symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer
Types of non-melanoma skin cancer
Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop.
The 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are:
basal cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers
squamous cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers
Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses and
Bowen’s disease
may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.
Why does it happen?
Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps.
In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as:
a family history of the condition
pale skin that burns easily
a large number of moles or freckles
Read more about the
causes of non-melanoma skin cancer
Who is affected?
Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. It affects slightly more men than women.
Diagnosis
Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer.
Your GP may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don’t need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks.
The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a
biopsy
to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer.
A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope.
Read more about
diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer
Treating non-melanoma skin cancer
Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin.
Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).
Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.
It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases.
Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases.
Read more about
treating non-melanoma skin cancer
Complications
If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe.
If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours.
Prevention
Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light.
You can help protect yourself from
sunburn
by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day.
Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.
Regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.
Read more about
sunscreen and sun safety
Symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer
The main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn’t heal.
The lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour.
Non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and shoulders.
Basal cell carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or ‘waxy’ looking. It can also look like a red, scaly patch.
The lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.
Squamous cell carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump and may have a flat, scaly and crusted surface.
The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.
Bowen’s disease
Bowen’s disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as ‘squamous cell carcinoma in situ’. It develops slowly and is easily treated.
The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin.
When to seek medical advice
If you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.

Cancer Research UK:

Symptoms of skin cancer
Causes of non-melanoma skin cancer
Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.
Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light:
ultraviolet A (UVA)
ultraviolet B (UVB)
ultraviolet C (UVC)
UVC is filtered out by the Earth’s atmosphere but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.
Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.
Repeated
sunburn
, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer.
Family history
Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.
Increased risk
Certain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:
pale skin that does not tan easily
red or blonde hair
blue eyes
older age
a large number of moles
a large number of freckles
an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment
a condition that suppresses your immune system, such as
HIV
medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants
exposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic
a previous diagnosis of skin cancer

Diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer
A diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your GP who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist.
Some GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of skin cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
Biopsy
If skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. The specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination.
However, they will probably also perform a
biopsy
– a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. This is usually carried out under a
local anaesthetic
, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won’t feel pain.
This allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body.
Sometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. In other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread.
It may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy.
Further tests
If you have basal cell carcinoma (BCC), then you usually won’t require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread.
However, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body.
These tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). If cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell.
If the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. This is called a fine needle aspiration (FNA).
During FNA, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. Finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body.
Treating non-melanoma skin cancer
Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances.
Overall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer.
People with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse.
If you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment.
When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:
the type of cancer you have
the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread)
your general health
Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced healthcare guidelines about NHS skin cancer services. These outline NICE’s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated.

NICE:
improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma
Surgical excision
Surgical excision is an operation to cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed.
It may be done in combination with a skin graft, if it’s likely to leave significant scarring. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area.
In many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer.
Curettage and electrocautery
Curettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small.
The surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. It is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over.
After about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. Cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin.
Mohs micrographic surgery
Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when:
it’s felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning
the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes
It involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. This minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring.
Each time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. The procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. In the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin.
This type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. As only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. However, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma, Bowen’s disease and actinic keratoses. It involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light.
After the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. PDT may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring.
Imiquimod cream
Imiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). It’s also used to treat actinic keratoses. Imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin.
Common side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin and itchiness.
Less common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin.
Wash the cream off and contact your GP if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. The level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. However, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy.
Radiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if:
surgery would be unsuitable
the cancer covers a large area
the area is difficult to operate on
Radiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant radiotherapy.
Electrochemotherapy
Electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. It may be considered if:
surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked
radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t worked
The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.
These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed).
Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.
It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.
Your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.

Sore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about. They normally get better within a week.
Most are caused by minor illnesses such as cold or flu and can be treated at home.
Treatments for a sore throat
There are things you can do to help soothe a sore throat.
Do
take ibuprofen or paracetamol – paracetamol is better for children and for people who can’t take ibuprofen (children under 16 should never take aspirin)
drink plenty of cool or warm fluids, and avoid very hot drinks
eat cool, soft foods
avoid smoking and smoky places
suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies – but don’t give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking
gargle with a homemade mouthwash of warm, salty water (children should not try this)
How to gargle with salt water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water (warm water helps salt dissolve).
Gargle with the solution, then spit it out (do not swallow it).
Repeat as often as you like.
There are also products such as medicated lozenges and sprays sold in pharmacies that you may want to try. There isn’t much scientific evidence to suggest they help, although some people find them worth using.
Antibiotics
aren’t usually prescribed for a sore throat, even if it’s caused by a bacterial infection. They’re unlikely to make you feel better any quicker and they have unpleasant
side effects
.
Sore throat self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
When to get professional advice
Go to A&E or phone 999 if:
You or your child have:
symptoms that are severe or getting worse quickly
difficulty breathing or swallowing
severe pain
started drooling
a muffled voice
a high-pitched sound as you breathe (stridor)
If you have a sore throat, you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy.
Find your nearest pharmacy
You don’t usually need to get medical advice if you have a sore throat. Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP if:
your symptoms are severe – for example with a high temperature or you feel shivery
you have persistent symptoms that haven’t started to improve after a week
you experience severe sore throats frequently
you have a weak immune system – for example, you have
HIV
, are having
chemotherapy
, or are taking medication that suppresses your immune system
If your GP practice is closed, phone
111
.
If you have a persistent sore throat (one that lasts 3 to 4 weeks), you should see your GP who may refer you for further tests. This is because your sore throat may be a symptom of a more serious condition.
Causes of a sore throat
The cause of a sore throat isn’t always obvious. But in most cases it’s a symptom of a viral or bacterial infection.
Common causes
A sore throat is often a symptom of:
colds
or
flu
– you may also have a blocked or runny nose, a
cough
, a high temperature (fever), a
headache
and general aches
laryngitis
(inflammation of the voice box) – you may also have a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat
tonsillitis
(inflammation of the tonsils) – you may also have red or spotty tonsils, discomfort when swallowing and a fever
strep throat (a bacterial throat infection) – you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis
glandular fever
– you may also feel very tired, have a fever and swollen glands in your neck
It may also be caused by something irritating your throat. For example, smoke,
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
(where acid leaks up from the stomach) and
allergies
.
Less common causes
Less often, a sore throat can be a sign of:
a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat (quinsy) – the pain may be severe and you may also have difficulty opening your mouth or difficulty swallowing
inflammation of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat (epiglottitis) – the pain may be severe and you may have difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing
These conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible."

A stomach ache is cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It usually does not last long and is often not serious. Severe abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern.
Abdominal pain self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Stomach cramps with bloating
Stomach cramps with bloating are often caused by trapped wind.
Your pharmacist can recommend treatments to help, such as:
buscopan
mebeverine
Find your local pharmacy
Sudden stomach cramps with diarrhoea
If your stomach cramps have started recently and you also have
diarrhoea
, the cause may be a
tummy bug (gastroenteritis)
. This means you have a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and bowel. It should get better without treatment after a few days.
Gastroenteritis may be caused by:
coming into close contact with someone who’s infected
eating contaminated food (
food poisoning
)
If you have repeated bouts of stomach cramps and diarrhoea, you may have a long-term condition, such as
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
.
Sudden severe abdominal pain
Sudden agonising pain in a particular area of your abdomen may be a sign of a serious problem. It could rapidly get worse without treatment.
If there is any possibility that you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test.
Go to A&E or phone 999 for an ambulance if:
you’re less than 16 weeks pregnant and have severe abdominal pain
a stomach ache came on very suddenly or is severe
it hurts when you touch your stomach
you’re vomiting blood or your vomit looks like ground coffee
your poo is bloody or black and sticky and extremely smelly
you cannot pee
you cannot poo or fart
you cannot breathe
you have chest pain
you have diabetes and you’re vomiting
someone has collapsed
Speak to your GP if:
a stomach ache gets much worse quickly
stomach pain or bloating will not go away or keeps coming back
you have stomach pain and problems with swallowing food
you’re losing weight without trying to
you suddenly pee more often or less often
peeing is suddenly painful
you bleed from your bottom or vagina, or have abnormal discharge from your vagina
you have diarrhoea that does not go away after a few days
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
Serious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:
appendicitis
– the swelling of the appendix means your appendix will need to be removed
a bleeding or perforated
stomach ulcer
acute cholecystitis
– inflammation of the gallbladder, which may need to be removed
kidney stones
– small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you’ll need to go to hospital to have them broken up
diverticulitis
– inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with
antibiotics
in hospital
ectopic pregnancy
– when a fertilised egg develops outside the womb – ectopic pregnancy can be very serious if it isn’t treated
If your GP suspects you have one of these conditions, they may refer you to hospital immediately.
Sudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.
Long-term or recurring abdominal pain
See your GP if you or your child have persistent or repeated abdominal pain. The cause is often not serious and can be managed.
Possible causes in adults include:
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
– the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – for example
Crohn’s disease
,
ulcerative colitis
and
endometriosis
a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
that keeps returning – you’ll usually also have a burning sensation when you urinate
constipation
period pain – painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle
stomach ulcer
heartburn and acid reflux
gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
Possible causes in children include:
constipation
a UTI that keeps returning
heartburn and acid reflux
abdominal migraines – recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with no identifiable cause"

About stomach cancer
Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a fairly uncommon type of cancer.
The initial
symptoms of stomach cancer
are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious conditions. They include:
persistent
indigestion
and
heartburn
trapped wind and frequent burping
feeling very full or bloated after meals
persistent
stomach pain
Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include:
blood in your stools, or black stools
loss of appetite
weight loss
As the early symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it’s diagnosed. It’s therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your GP as soon as possible.
Read more about
diagnosing stomach cancer
Who’s affected
The exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you’re more likely to develop it if you:
are male
are 55 years of age or older
smoke
have a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat
have a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods
have a stomach infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria
Read more about the
causes of stomach cancer
.
Types of stomach cancer
There are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas.
Less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall.
How stomach cancer is treated
Many cases of stomach cancer can’t be completely cured, but it’s still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using
chemotherapy
and in some cases
radiotherapy
and surgery.
If operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue can be removed.
Surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you’ll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.
Chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.

treating stomach cancer
Living with stomach cancer
Living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support.
Read more about
living with stomach cancer
Symptoms of stomach cancer
Many symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages.
Early stage symptoms include:
persistent
indigestion
trapped wind and frequent burping
heartburn
feeling full very quickly when eating
feeling bloated after eating
feeling sick
pain in your stomach or breastbone
difficulty swallowing (
dysphagia
)
vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages
Advanced stomach cancer
Symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:
blood in your stools, or black stools
loss of appetite
weight loss
tiredness
lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid)
anaemia
(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless)
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
When to seek medical help
Stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it’s diagnosed early. It’s therefore important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.
Stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.
Indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it’s unlikely that someone with indigestion who’s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.
However, see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They should refer you to a specialist for further testing.
Also see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This isn’t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.

diagnosing stomach cancer
Causes of stomach cancer
Stomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it’s unclear exactly why these changes occur.
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body).
Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.
It’s not known what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.
Increased risk
However, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your chances of developing stomach cancer.
Age and gender
Your risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over.
For reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer.
Smoking
People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach.
The more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking, the bigger the risk. In the UK, around 1 in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.
H. pylori infection
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as
stomach ulcers
, recurring bouts of
indigestion
or long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis).
Research has found people with severe chronic atrophic gastritis have an increased risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small.
Diet
A diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer.
Countries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK.
A high fibre diet with 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer.
Family history
You’re more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling.
It’s not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents.
In around 1 in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin.
You may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer.
There’s also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. FAP causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developing
bowel cancer
.
Having another type of cancer
Your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you’ve had another type of cancer, such as
cancer of the oesophagus
or
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(cancer that develops in your white blood cells).
For men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having
prostate cancer
,
bladder cancer
,
breast cancer
or
testicular cancer
. For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having
ovarian cancer
,
breast cancer
or
cervical cancer
.
Certain medical conditions
Having certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as
pernicious anaemia
(a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can’t absorb it properly), and
peptic stomach ulcers
(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection).
Stomach surgery
If you’ve had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer.
This can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer.
How stomach cancer spreads
There are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread:
directly – the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity)
through the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection
through the blood – which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver
Stomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.
Diagnosing stomach cancer
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. If they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they’ll refer you to a specialist for further investigation.
In 2015, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and
symptoms of stomach cancer
and refer people for the right tests faster. Find out
who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer
.
Hospital tests
If your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they’ll refer you to a specialist for tests.
These may include a
blood test
and chest
X-ray
, which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood.
Because of the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks. Read more about
waiting times
.
Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound
An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end).
If you need to have an endoscopy, you won’t be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty.
You’ll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A
local anaesthetic
may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed.
The endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any
stomach ulcers
or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a
biopsy
. The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back.
The endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit.
If your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an
ultrasound scan
at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb).
If you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it’s passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach.
After an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won’t be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a
sore throat
, although this should pass within a few days.
Barium meal X-ray
A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it’s less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers.
Organs such as your stomach don’t usually show up on an X-ray because they’re made of soft tissue that isn’t dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen.
You won’t able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.
A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause
constipation
. Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system.
Further testing
If you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it’s spread and how quickly it’s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you.
However, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.
Laparoscopy
Your specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a
general anaesthetic
, so you’ll be unconscious during it.
During the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision.
Computerised tomography or positron emission tomography scans
During
CT scans
or
PET scans
, a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body.
These scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. It allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. The scans can also help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you.
Liver ultrasound scan
If your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver
ultrasound
. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver.
Staging and grading
After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have.
Staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged. One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread.
The majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn’t usually possible.
Grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer:
low-grade – the cancer tends to grow slowly
medium-grade – the cancer grows a bit faster
high-grade – the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly
Cancer Research UK has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer.
Treating stomach cancer
The treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread.
Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances.
Feel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.
Your treatment plan
The main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery,
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
. You may have 1 of these treatments or a combination.
If surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery.
Surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage.
Where possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body. It’s estimated that a cure is possible in 20 to 30% of stomach cancer cases.
If it’s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.
In some cases, it’s not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. In this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy.
A relatively new medication called trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer.
Your healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.
Surgery
If you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage, it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery.
In some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet), rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to remove a sample of the tumour for testing (
biopsy
). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage.
However, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. If this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. This will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery.
Any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You’ll also need several weeks at home to recover.
Surgery to remove your stomach
You may need to have part or all of your stomach removed.
Surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of your stomach, using a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy.
These operations may be carried out using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under
general anaesthetic
, which means you’ll be unconscious throughout the procedure.
During these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It’s possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning.
Partial gastrectomy
If your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy to remove it.
After surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won’t be affected.
Total gastrectomy or oesophagogastrectomy
If your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may need to have an oesophagogastrectomy.
If you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum.
Surgery to ease your symptoms
If your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery.
However, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. A blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating.
If your stomach is blocked, there are a few options:
stenting – a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under
local anaesthetic
; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach
partial or total gastrectomy – to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms
bypass surgery – an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines, to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. As it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body.
You may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back.
Chemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery.
If may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both.
Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks.
Alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.
Side effects of chemotherapy
Chemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include:
tiredness
nausea and vomiting
nerve damage (
peripheral neuropathy
)
hair loss
diarrhoea
anaemia
(a lack of red blood cells)
weight loss
skin changes – such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet
The side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. You’ll be told who to contact if you’re experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it’s very important that this contact information is recorded carefully.
If you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy.
The side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. Once your treatment is over, the hair follicles and blood cells will repair themselves. This means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before).
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses beams of high energy
radiation
to destroy cancer cells. It’s not often used to treat stomach cancer because there’s a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment.
However, if you have advanced stomach cancer that’s causing pain or bleeding, you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring.
If a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing
anaemia
, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding.
If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. This is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. You’ll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible.
Radiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. Each session will only last a few minutes. The radiation doesn’t stay in your system afterwards, and it’s perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments.
How long you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it’s used. Radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. If it’s being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.
Side effects of radiotherapy
You may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy:
tiredness
nausea
diarrhoea
irritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes place
These side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing.
Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab (sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication used to treat
breast cancer
and some cases of advanced stomach cancer.
Some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn’t cure stomach cancer, but it can slow its growth and increase survival time.
If you’re diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the HER2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you’ll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you’ll usually need a session once every 3 weeks.
Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as
angina
, uncontrolled high blood pressure (
hypertension
) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems.
Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:
an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever
diarrhoea
tiredness
aches and pains
Living with stomach cancer
Being diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope.
You may find the following advice helpful:
keep talking to your friends and family – they can be a powerful support system
talk to others in the same situation
research your condition
set reasonable goals
take time out for yourself
Cancer charities, such as
Macmillan Cancer Support
, are a good source of information and support.
Recovery
Getting back to normal after surgery can take time. It’s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. During your recovery, avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. You may also be advised not to drive.
Some other treatments, particularly
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.
Follow-up
After your treatment has finished, you’ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year. During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may arrange
blood tests
or scans to see how you’re responding to treatment.
Diet after surgery
If you’ve had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. This is because your stomach won’t be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. You should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand.
If you’ve had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. As with a partial gastrectomy, you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. You may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. Your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat.
Having surgery to remove your stomach also means you’ll need to have regular injections of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent a condition called
anaemia
and nerve problems.
Looking after yourself
Eat regularly and healthily. You may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day.
It’s understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. You may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for. Remember: you’re human, and those feelings are natural.
Dealing with dying
If your stomach cancer can’t be cured, your GP will give you support and any necessary pain relief (often alongside chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can be used to reduce your symptoms). This is called
palliative care
. Support is also available for your family and friends."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/injuries/skin-injuries/sunburn/,"Sunburn
Sunburn is skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays. It usually causes the skin to become red, sore, warm, tender and occasionally itchy for about a week.
The skin will normally start to flake and peel after a few days and will usually fully heal within 7 days.
While sunburn is often short-lived and mild, it’s important to try to avoid it, because it can increase your chances of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life.
It’s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn’t usually develop for several hours. Breezes and getting wet (such as going in and out of the sea) may cool your skin, so you don’t realise you’re getting burnt.
You should always be aware of the risk of sunburn if you’re outside in strong sun, and look out for your skin getting hot.
What to do if you’re sunburnt
If you or your child has sunburn, you should get out of the sun as soon as possible – head indoors or into a shady area.
You can usually treat mild sunburn at home, although there are some circumstances where you should seek medical advice.
The following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until your skin heals.
Do
cool the skin by sponging it with cold water or by having a cold bath or shower – applying a cold compress such as a cold flannel to the affected area may also help
drink plenty of fluids to cool you down and prevent dehydration
take pain relief such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve any pain – aspirin should not be given to children under 16
try to avoid all sunlight, including through windows, by covering up the affected areas of skin until your skin has fully healed
Get treatment advice from your local pharmacy
Your nearest pharmacist can advise you on the best treatment if you have sunburn.
Find your nearest pharmacy
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP practice if:
You have sunburn and feel unwell or have any concerns about your sunburn, particularly if you’re burnt over a large area or have any of the more severe symptoms such as:
blistering or swelling of the skin (oedema)
chills
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five
dizziness,
headaches
and feeling sick (symptoms of heat exhaustion)
You should also see your GP if a young child or baby has sunburn, as their skin is particularly fragile.
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
Your GP may recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin.
Severe sunburn may require special burn cream and burn dressings from your GP or a nurse at your GP practice. Very occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed.
Who’s at risk of sunburn?
Everyone who is exposed to UV light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others.
You should take extra care when out in the sun if you:
have pale, white or light brown skin
have freckles or red or fair hair
tend to burn rather than tan
have many moles
have skin problems relating to a medical condition
are only exposed to intense sun occasionally – for example, while on holiday
are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense
have a family history of skin cancer
People who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it’s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don’t take the right precautions.
Snow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun’s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes.
Dangers of UV rays
The short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sun
allergy
.
The longer-term risks (over decades) include:
actinic (solar) keratoses – rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin
skin cancer – including both
melanoma
and
non-melanoma skin cancer
eye problems – such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and cataracts
premature ageing of the skin and wrinkling
Preventing sunburn
Skin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen.
In the UK, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from March to October, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun’s rays are strongest.
There is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions. For example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions.
Suitable clothing
Suitable clothing includes:
a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears
a long-sleeved top
trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through
sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the CE Mark and European Standard EN 1836:2005.
Sunscreen
When buying sunscreen, make sure it’s suitable for your skin and blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation.
The sunscreen label should have:
the letters ‘UVA’ in a circle logo and at least 4-star UVA protection
at least SPF30 sunscreen to protect against UVB
Most people do not apply enough sunscreen. The amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (SPF) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion.
If sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. If you’re worried you might not be applying enough SPF30, you could use a stronger SPF50 sunscreen.
If you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice:
30 minutes before going out
just before you go out
Sunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better.
How long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. The Cancer Research UK website has a handy tool where you can
find out your skin type
, to see when you might be at risk of burning.
Water-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely.
Sunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This includes straight after you’ve been in water (even if it is ‘water-resistant’) and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off.
Advice for babies and children
Children aged under 6 months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight.
From March to October in the UK, children should:
cover up with suitable clothing
spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm)
wear at least SPF30 sunscreen
To ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under 5 are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/supraventricular-tachycardia/,"Supraventricular tachycardia
Supraventricular tachycardia is a condition where the heartbeat is abnormally fast.
It can happen to anyone at any age and often occurs for the first time in children or young adults.
In most cases, supraventricular tachycardia is harmless. It doesn’t usually last long and can settle without treatment.
Why it happens
Some people are born with an abnormality of the heart’s natural ‘wiring’ or conduction system. This allows a short circuit to develop. Under certain circumstances, this allows the heart to race very fast.
One example of this is
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
. This is where there’s an abnormal electrical connection between the:
atria (upper heart chambers), and
the ventricles (lower heart chambers)
Some people with this condition can develop supraventricular tachycardias. This is because of this short circuit.
Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia
If you have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll usually feel your heart racing in your chest or throat.
The heart rate is usually between 140 to 180 beats per minute but can be as high as 250. A normal heartbeat should be 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest.
During a supraventricular tachycardia, the heart muscle contracts very fast. This means that it cannot relax properly between contractions to fill with blood. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body.
Therefore, you may also feel:
chest pain
dizziness
light-headedness
fatigue (tiredness)
breathlessness
On rare occasions, you may faint because of a drop in blood pressure.
These symptoms vary in length and frequency.
Diagnosing supraventricular tachycardia
If your doctor thinks that you might have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll be referred for tests. These can include an:
electrocardiogram (ECG)
ambulatory heart monitor
echocardiogram
Causes of supraventricular tachycardia
Common causes of supraventricular tachycardia in people at risk of the condition include:
stress
anxiety
a change in posture
some medications
alcohol
caffeine
smoking
recreational drugs
Treating supraventricular tachycardia
The treatment for supraventricular tachycardia varies from person to person. It depends on:
the type of supraventricular tachycardia you have
your symptoms
treatment of any underlying cause
your age
your overall health
Types of treatment
Supraventricular tachycardia treatments focus on controlling the rate and rhythm of the heart. They include:
medication, like
beta blockers
and other anti-arrhythmic drugs
electric shock treatment (DC cardioversion) in an urgent case
radiofrequency ablation"

About testicular cancer
Cancer of the testicle is one of the less common cancers. It tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age.
The most common symptom is a painless
lump or swelling in one of the testicles
. It can be the size of a pea or it may be much larger.
Other symptoms can include:
a dull ache in the scrotum
a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum
It’s important to be aware of what feels normal for you. Get to know your body and speak to your GP if you notice any changes.

The testicles
The testicles are the 2 oval-shaped male sex organs that sit inside the scrotum on either side of the penis.
The testicles are an important part of the male reproductive system because they produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which plays a major role in male sexual development.
Types of testicular cancer
The different types of testicular cancer are classified by the type of cells the
cancer
begins in.
The most common type of testicular cancer is ‘germ cell testicular cancer’, which accounts for around 95% of all cases. Germ cells are a type of cell that the body uses to create sperm.
There are 2 main subtypes of germ cell testicular cancer. They are:
seminomas – which have become more common in the last 20 years and now account for 50 to 55% of testicular cancers
non-seminomas – which account for most of the rest and include teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and yolk sac tumours
Both types tend to respond well to
chemotherapy
.
Less common types of testicular cancer include:
Leydig cell tumours – which account for around 1 to 3% of cases
Sertoli cell tumours – which account for around 1% of cases
lymphoma – which accounts for around 4% of cases
This topic focuses on germ cell testicular cancer. You can contact the cancer support specialists at
Macmillan
for more information about Leydig cell tumour and Sertoli cell tumours. Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and it’s open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm.

How common is testicular cancer?
Testicular cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.
Testicular cancer is unusual compared to other cancers because it tends to affect younger men and anyone with testicles. Although it’s relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49.
For reasons that are unclear, white men and anyone with testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with other ethnic groups.
The number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear.
Causes of testicular cancer
The exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man’s risk of developing it. The 3 main risk factors are described below.
Undescended testicles
Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.
About 3 to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don’t descend.
In most cases, testicles that don’t descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend at a later stage. If the testicles don’t descend naturally, an operation known as an orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.
It’s important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys whose testicles descend normally. It’s also much easier to observe the testicles when they’re in the scrotum.
People with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than those whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.
Family history
Having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.
For example, if your father had testicular cancer, you’re around 4 times more likely to develop it than someone with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you’re about 8 times more likely to develop it.
A number of genes may be involved in the development of testicular cancer in families where more than 1 person has had the condition. This is an ongoing area of research in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.
Previous testicular cancer
People who’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.
For this reason, if you’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it’s very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.
If you’ve been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it’s very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.
Cancer Research UK has more information about
testicular cancer risks and causes
.
Outlook
Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers.
Almost all men and anyone with testicles who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it’s rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.
Treatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle – called orchidectomy or orchiectomy – which doesn’t usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.
In some cases,
chemotherapy
or, less commonly,
radiotherapy
may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).

Symptoms of testicular cancer
The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles.
The lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger.
Most lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren’t in the testicle and aren’t a sign of cancer. But they should never be ignored. Visit your GP as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum.
Associated symptoms
Testicular cancer can also cause other symptoms, including a:
dull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go
feeling of heaviness in your scrotum
change in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle
difference between one testicle and the other
When to speak to your GP
Speak to your GP as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. They’ll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous.
Lumps within the scrotum can have many different causes and testicular cancer is rare. If your GP thinks the lump is in your testicle they may consider cancer as a possible cause.
Research has shown that less than 4% of scrotal lumps or swellings are cancerous. For example, varicoceles (swollen blood vessels) and epididymal cysts (cysts in the tubes around the testicle) are common causes of testicular lumps.
If you do have testicular cancer, the sooner treatment begins, the greater the likelihood that you’ll be completely cured.
If you don’t feel comfortable visiting your GP, you can
go to your local sexual health clinic
, where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you.
Metastatic cancer
If testicular cancer has spread to other parts of your body, you may also experience other symptoms. Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is known as metastatic cancer.
Around 5% of people with testicular cancer will experience symptoms of metastatic cancer.
The most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. Lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. Less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones.
Symptoms of metastatic testicular cancer can include:
a persistent
cough
coughing or spitting up blood
shortness of breath
swelling and enlargement of male breasts
a lump or swelling in your neck
lower back pain
Diagnosing testicular cancer
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump or other abnormality in your scrotum that you think may be on one of your testicles.
Most scrotal lumps aren’t cancerous, but if you have a lump that you think may be in one of your testicles it’s important you have it checked as soon as possible. Treatment for testicular cancer is much more effective when started early.
Physical examination
As well as asking you about your symptoms and looking at your medical history, your GP will usually need to examine your testicles.
They may hold a small light or torch against your scrotum to see whether light passes through it. Testicular lumps tend to be solid, which means light is unable to pass through them. A collection of fluid in the scrotum will allow light to pass through it.
Tests for testicular cancer
If you have a non-painful lump, or a change in shape or texture of one of your testicles, and your GP thinks it may be cancerous, you’ll be referred for further testing within 2 weeks.
Scrotal ultrasound
A scrotal
ultrasound
s
can
is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your testicle. It’s one of the main ways of finding out whether or not a lump is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).
During a scrotal ultrasound, your specialist will be able to determine the position and size of the abnormality in your testicle.
It will also give a clear indication of whether the lump is in the testicle or separate within the scrotum, and whether it’s solid or filled with fluid. A fluid-filled lump or collection around the testis is usually harmless. A more solid lump may be a sign the swelling is cancerous.
Blood tests
To help confirm a diagnosis, you may need a series of
blood tests
to detect certain hormones in your blood, known as ‘markers’.
Testicular cancer often produces these markers, so if they’re in your blood it may indicate you have the condition.
Markers in your blood that will be tested for include:
AFP (alpha feta protein)
HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin)
A third blood test is also often carried out as it may indicate how active a cancer is. It’s called LDH (lactate dehydrogenate), but it isn’t a specific marker for testicular cancer.
Not all people with testicular cancer produce markers. There may still be a chance you have testicular cancer even if your blood test results come back normal.
Histology
The only way to definitively confirm testicular cancer is to examine part of the lump under a microscope. These tests and reports are called histology.
Unlike many cancers where a small piece of the cancer can be removed (a
biopsy
), in most cases the only way to examine a testicular lump is by removing the affected testicle completely.
This is because the combination of the ultrasound and blood marker tests is usually sufficient to make a firm diagnosis. Also, a biopsy may injure the testicle and spread cancer into the scrotum which isn’t usually affected.
Your specialist will only recommend removing your testicle if they’re relatively certain the lump is cancerous. Losing a testicle won’t affect your sex life or ability to have children.
The removal of a testicle is called an orchidectomy. It’s the main type of treatment for testicular cancer, so if you have testicular cancer it’s likely you’ll need to have an orchidectomy.
Other tests
In almost all cases, you’ll need further tests to check whether testicular cancer has spread. When cancer of the testicle spreads, it most commonly affects the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen or the lungs.
Therefore, you may require a chest
X-ray
to check for signs of a tumour. You’ll also need a scan of your entire body. This is usually a
CT scan
(computerised X-ray) to check for signs of the cancer spreading. In some cases, a different type of scan, known as a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan

Stages of testicular cancer
After all tests have been completed, it’s usually possible to determine the stage of your cancer.
There are 2 ways that testicular cancer can be staged. The first is known as the TNM staging system:
T – indicates the size of the tumour
N – indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes
M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)
Testicular cancer is also staged numerically. The 4 main stages are:
stage 1 – the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle)
stage 2 – the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen
stage 3 – the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or in the neck
stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the lungs or, rarely, to other tissues or organs, such as the liver, bones or brain
Cancer Research UK has
more information about testicular cancer stages
.
Treating testicular cancer
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer.
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on:
the
type of testicular cancer you have
– whether it’s a seminoma or a non-seminoma
the
stage of your testicular cancer
The first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy).
For stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose of
chemotherapy
may be given to help prevent the cancer returning. A short course of
radiotherapy
is also sometimes recommended.
However, in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you’re very carefully monitored over the next few years. Further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.
For stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.
For stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.
Some people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of chemotherapy.
In non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.
Before discussing your treatment options with your specialist, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Orchidectomy
An orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. If you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading.
By removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved. Your sex life and ability to father children won’t be affected.
About 1 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. In such circumstances, it’s sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. You should ask your surgeon about this if you’re in this position.
If testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require.
An orchidectomy isn’t carried out through the scrotum. It’s done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. The operation is carried out under
general anaesthetic
.
You can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn’t greatly affected. The artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic). It probably won’t be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. It may be slightly different in size or texture.
After an orchidectomy, it’s often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. If only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn’t be any lasting side effects.
If both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you’ll be infertile. However, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date.
You may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.
Sperm banking
Most people are still fertile after having 1 testicle removed. However, some treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility.
Some people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops.
For some treatments, such as chemotherapy, infertility may occur, but standard chemotherapies have a less than 50% chance of causing infertility if the remaining testicle is normal.
In people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), the ability to ejaculate (eject sperm from the penis) may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm.
Before your treatment begins, you may want to consider sperm banking. This is where a sample of your sperm is frozen so that it can be used at a later date to impregnate your partner during artificial insemination. Before sperm banking, you may be asked to have tests for
HIV
,
hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
.
If you’re having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 to 4 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. Ask if you’re concerned about your fertility.
Not all men are suitable for sperm banking. For the technique to work, the sperm has to be of a reasonably high quality. There may also be situations where it’s considered too dangerous to delay treatment for sperm banking to take place.
Most NHS cancer treatment centres offer a free sperm banking service. However, it’s up to each area of the country to decide whether they store sperm for free or whether you have to pay.
Cancer Research UK has
more information about sperm banking
, including the cost of sperm storage.
Testosterone replacement therapy
If you still have a remaining testicle, in most cases (90%) your body will make enough testosterone so you won’t notice any difference.
If there are any problems with your remaining testicle, you may experience symptoms due to a lack of testosterone. These symptoms can be caused for other reasons but can include:
tiredness
weight gain
loss of libido
(sex drive)
reduced beard growth
reduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection (
erectile dysfunction
)
Having both testicles removed will definitely stop you producing testosterone and you’ll develop the above symptoms.
Testosterone replacement therapy is where you’re given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin. If you have injections, you’ll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months.
After having testosterone replacement therapy, you’ll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve.
Side effects associated with this type of treatment are uncommon, and any side effects that you do experience will usually be mild. They may include:
oily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset of
acne
breast enlargement and swelling
a change in normal urinary patterns, such as needing to urinate more frequently or having problems passing urine (caused by an
enlarged prostate gland
that puts pressure on your bladder)
There are also concerns that testosterone replacement may increase the risk of
prostate cancer
and you should discuss this with your doctor.
However, the risks from having testosterone replacement are usually much lower than the benefits of receiving it.
Lymph node and lung surgery
More advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of your body’s immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection.
Lymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing.
In some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.
If you have retrograde ejaculation, you’ll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won’t be able to father a child.
There are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder.
Men and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).
There are also a number of newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility.
Some people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven’t disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. This type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn’t usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.
Nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection
A newer type of lymph node surgery, called nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility.
In nerve-sparing RPLND, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. This means there’s less chance of nerve damage occurring. The disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding. Therefore, nerve-sparing RPLND is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training.
Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection
Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND) is a type of ‘keyhole’ surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes. During LRPLND, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions in your abdomen.
An instrument called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. An endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor.
Small, surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes.
The advantage of LRPLND is that there’s less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery time. Also, as with nerve-sparing RPLND, in LRPLND there’s a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to retrograde ejaculation.
However, as LRPLND is a new technique, there’s little available evidence regarding the procedure’s long-term safety and effectiveness. If you’re considering LRPLND, you should understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. Sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.
It may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer.
If testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy.
Side effects of radiotherapy
can include:
reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to
sunburn
nausea
diarrhoea
fatigue
These side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.
You may require chemotherapy if you have advanced testicular cancer or it’s spread within your body. It’s also used to help prevent the cancer returning. Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours.
Chemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein. In some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so that you don’t have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein.
Sometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body’s normal, healthy cells. This is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. The most common include:
vomiting
hair loss
nausea
sore mouth and
mouth ulcers
loss of appetite
fatigue
breathlessness and lung damage
infertility
ringing in your ears (
tinnitus
)
skin that bleeds or bruises easily
low blood counts
increased vulnerability to infection
numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet
kidney damage
These side effects are usually only temporary and should improve after you’ve completed your treatment.
Side effects, such as infections that occur when you have a low blood count, can be life-threatening, and it’s essential that you always call your cancer care team if you’re worried between chemotherapy treatments.
Bleomycin
One of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage and you should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle. However, the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure.
Having children
You shouldn’t father children while having chemotherapy and for a year after your treatment has finished. This is because chemotherapy medications can temporarily damage your sperm, increasing your risk of fathering a baby with serious birth defects. Therefore, you’ll need to use a reliable method of
contraception
, such as a
condom
, during this time.
Condoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy. This is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
Follow-up
Even if your cancer has been completely cured, there’s a risk it will return. The risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at when you were diagnosed and what treatment you’ve had since.
Most recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. In seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. Recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people.
Because of the risk of recurrence, you’ll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. These include:
a physical examination
blood tests
to check for tumour markers
a chest
X-ray
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
Follow-up and testing is usually recommended depending on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered. This is usually more frequent in the first year or two but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years. In certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer.
If the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer, and it’s diagnosed at an early stage, it will usually be possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy. Some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%.
Recurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you’ll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you.
Cancer Research UK has more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.
Causes of testicular cancer
The causes of testicular cancer are not fully understood.
However, several things that increase your risk of developing the condition.
Undescended testicles
Undescended testicles is the most significant risk factor.
When male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. The testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life.
However, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. The medical name for undescended testicles is cryptorchidism.
Surgery is usually required to move the testicles down. If you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased.
Of surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. However, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater than that of the rest of the population.
Previous testicular cancer
Men and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle.
For this reason, it’s important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer.
Age and race
Unlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. Men and anyone with testicles aged 30 to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer.
Testicular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. It’s also more common in Northern and Western Europe compared with other parts of the world.
Family history
Having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it.
If your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop it than a person with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it).
The fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer.
Mutations in 2 genes (known as the KITLG and SPRY4 genes) may increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer.
Endocrine disruptors
Examples of endocrine disruptors include:
some types of pesticide
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical compounds used as a coolant
dibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polish
In most countries, including the UK, many endocrine disruptors, such as PCBs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. However, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain.
However, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. Indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated.
Infertility
Men and anyone with testicles who are infertile are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. The reasons for this are not clear.
Smoking
Research has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer than non-smokers.
HIV and AIDS
Studies show that men and anyone with testicles with
HIV or AIDS
have an increased risk of testicular cancer."

About stomach ulcers
Stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers) are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. These are called duodenal ulcers.
Stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. This information applies to both.
Symptoms of stomach ulcers
Although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful.
Some people experience:
indigestion
heartburn
nausea (feeling sick)
You should speak to your GP if you think you have a stomach ulcer.
More about the
symptoms of a stomach ulcer
Get urgent medical advice
Speak to your GP immediately (or phone 111) if:
your symptoms persist
you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds
you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools
you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse
These could be a sign of a serious complication.
What causes stomach ulcers?
Stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged.
This is usually caused by:
an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they’re taken for a long time or at high doses
There’s little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.
More about the
causes of stomach ulcers
Treating stomach ulcers
You’ll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.
You’ll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) if your ulcer was caused by NSAIDs. Your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as
paracetamol
, may be recommended.
Most stomach ulcers take a few months to heal after treatment. However, stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed.
More about
treating stomach ulcers
Complications
Complications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening.
The main complications include:
bleeding at the site of the ulcer
the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open – known as perforation
the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system – known as gastric obstruction
More about the
complications of stomach ulcers
Stomach ulcer symptoms
The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy).
However, some stomach ulcers aren’t painful and are only noticed when a complication develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer.
Tummy pain
The pain caused by a stomach ulcer can either travel:
out from the middle of your tummy up to your neck
down to your belly button
through to your back
And:
can last from a few minutes to a few hours
often starts within a few hours of eating
can cause you to wake up during the night
Taking antacids (indigestion medication) may temporarily relieve the pain, but it will keep coming back if the ulcer isn’t treated.
Less common symptoms
Less common symptoms of a stomach ulcer include:
indigestion
heartburn
loss of appetite
feeling and being sick
weight loss
Some people also find they burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods.
Stomach ulcer causes
Stomach ulcers are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
These can break down the stomach’s defence against the acid it produces to digest food. The stomach lining then becomes damaged causing an ulcer to form.
H. pylori bacteria
H. pylori bacteria live in the stomach lining. The bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from stomach acid.
Infections are common. It’s possible to be infected without realising it because the infection doesn’t usually cause symptoms.
People of all ages can be infected. It’s not clear exactly why some people are more vulnerable to the effects of H. pylori bacteria than others.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (
NSAIDs)
NSAIDs are medicines widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling).
Commonly used NSAIDs include:
ibuprofen
aspirin
naproxen
diclofenac
Many people take NSAIDs without having any side effects. But there’s always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses.
You may be advised not to use NSAIDs if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you’ve had one in the past.
Paracetamol
is a safer painkiller to use.
More about
NSAIDs
Lifestyle factors
There’s little evidence that stomach ulcers are caused by:
spicy foods
stress
alcohol
But these can make the symptoms worse.
However, smoking can:
increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers
make treatment less effective
Stomach ulcer diagnosis
If your GP thinks you have an ulcer, they
will want to know if you’re taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
might test you for an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection
In some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy to look for an ulcer inside your stomach.
Testing for H. pylori infection
If your GP thinks your symptoms might be caused by an H. pylori infection, you’ll be offered a:
urea breath test
stool antigen test – a small stool sample is tested for the bacteria
blood test
Urea breath test
You’ll be given a special drink containing a chemical that’s broken down by H. pylori. Your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an H. pylori infection.
Blood test
A sample of your blood’s tested for antibodies to the H. pylori bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood to help fight infection.
This test’s now largely been replaced by the stool antigen test
More about
blood tests
Gastroscopy
A gastroscopy is a procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down into your stomach and first section of the small intestine (duodenum).
You may:
be given a mild sedative injection before the procedure
have your throat sprayed with a
local anaesthetic
to make it more comfortable to pass the endoscope
The images taken by the camera will usually confirm or rule out an ulcer. A small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum to test for the H. pylori bacteria.
You’ll have this procedure as an outpatient in hospital. This means you won’t have to spend the night.
You may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks to check that the ulcer’s healed.
Stomach ulcer treatment
If you have a stomach ulcer, your treatment will depend on what caused it.
With treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two.
Treating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection
If your stomach ulcer’s caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, you’ll be given:
a course of
antibiotics
a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
This is also recommended if it’s thought your stomach ulcer’s caused by a combination of an H. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Antibiotics
If you have an H. pylori infection, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of 2 or 3 antibiotics.
The most commonly used antibiotics are:
amoxicillin
clarithromycin
metronidazole
You should take these twice a day for a week.
Side effects
The side effects of these are usually mild, but can include:
feeling and being sick
diarrhoea
a metallic taste in your mouth
Further testing
You’ll be re-tested at least 4 weeks after finishing your antibiotic course to see if there are any H. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. If there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics may be given.
Ulcers caused by NSAIDs
If your stomach ulcer’s caused by taking NSAIDs:
you’ll be given a course of PPI medication
your use of NSAIDs will be reviewed, and you may be advised to use an alternative painkiller
Alternative painkillers
You may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such as
paracetamol
.
COX-2 inhibitors are sometimes recommended. These are an alternative type of NSAID that’s less likely to cause stomach ulcers.
Low-dose aspirin
If you’re taking low-dose
aspirin
to reduce your risk of blood clots, your GP will tell you whether you need to keep taking it.
If you do, you may also be prescribed long-term treatment with a PPI or H2-receptor antagonist to prevent further ulcers.
Complications
It’s important to understand the potential risks associated with continued NSAID use.
You’re more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding.
Read more about the
complications of stomach ulcers
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally.
The most commonly used PPIs are:
omeprazole
pantoprazole
lansoprazole
They’re usually prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks.
Side effects
Side effects of these are usually mild, but can include:
headaches
diarrhoea or
constipation
feeling sick
abdominal (tummy) pain
dizziness
rashes
These should pass once treatment has been completed.
H2-receptor antagonists
Sometimes a type of medication called H2-receptor antagonists are used instead of PPIs.
These also reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces.
Ranitidine is the most widely used H2-receptor antagonist for treating stomach ulcers.
Side effects
Side effects are uncommon, but can include:
diarrhoea
headaches
dizziness
rashes
tiredness
Antacids and alginates
As these treatments can take several hours before they start to work, your GP may recommend taking additional antacid medication.
Antacids:
neutralise your stomach acid
provide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief
should be taken when you experience symptoms or when you expect them, such as after meals or at bedtime
Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. Antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals.
You can buy these medications at pharmacies. Your pharmacist can tell you which is most suitable for you.
Side effects
Side effects of both medications are usually mild, but can include:
diarrhoea or constipation
farting
stomach cramps
feeling and being sick
Lifestyle changes
There aren’t any special lifestyle measures you need to take during treatment.
However, avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods and smoking may reduce your symptoms while your ulcer heals.
Stomach ulcer complications
Complications of stomach ulcers are rare, but can be very serious.
The main complications are:
internal bleeding
perforation – the lining of the stomach splits open
gastric outlet obstruction – the stomach ulcer obstructs the normal passage of food through your digestive system
Internal bleeding
Internal bleeding’s the most common complication of stomach ulcers. It can occur when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel.
The bleeding can either be slow and long-term, or rapid and severe.
Slow, long-term bleeding
Slow, long-term bleeding can lead to anaemia.
Symptoms of anaemia include:
fatigue
breathlessness
pale skin
heart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats)
You should visit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of anaemia. If they think you have a stomach ulcer, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist for an examination and treatment.
More about
anaemia
Severe bleeding
Contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately if you have symptoms of more severe bleeding, including:
you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds
you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools
Stopping severe bleeding
An endoscopy will be used to identify the cause of the bleeding. Treatment can be given during the endoscopy to stop the bleeding.
Sometimes:
specialised procedures carried out under
X-ray
guidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers
surgery is needed to repair the affected blood vessel
Blood transfusions
may also be needed to replace the blood you’ve lost.
Perforation
Perforations are a rarer complication of stomach ulcers. This is when the lining of the stomach splits open.
This can be very serious because it lets the bacteria that live in your stomach escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). This is known as peritonitis.
Peritonitis
In peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood (
sepsis
) before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated.
The most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. If you have this type of pain, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately.
Peritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. In some cases, surgery may be needed.
Gastric outlet obstruction
In some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can obstruct the normal passage of food through your digestive system. This is called a gastric outlet obstruction.
Symptoms include:
vomiting large amounts of undigested food
a constant feeling of bloating or fullness
feeling more full than usual after eating less food
unexplained weight loss
Treating a gastric outlet obstruction
An endoscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction.
If the obstruction’s caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down.
If the obstruction’s caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed. This can involve passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the obstruction."

Life after treatment for testicular cancer
The testicles
It can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. Understanding more about what they do might help.
Facts about testicles
Testicles are small and oval-shaped. They hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum.
From puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. This gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. You also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection.
The testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13 to 14 years old) onwards. When sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy.
The testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body.
Sperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. At ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. They go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through).
Lymph nodes (glands)
Lymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. We have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. They are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections.
Sometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). You’ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes.

Having tests for testicular cancer
You may have tests done by your GP or at the hospital. They will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer.
Visiting your GP
If you think you might have some of the symptoms of testicular cancer, you should go to your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.
If your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they’ll examine your testicles. They might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. This uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles.
At the hospital
If you need more tests you’ll be referred to a hospital. This could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital.
You’ll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests:
blood tests
to check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers – some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these
an ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven’t already had one) – this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid)
Removing a testicle
If your ultrasound shows the lump is almost certainly cancer, an operation to remove a testicle (orchidectomy) is done. You’ll only have this operation if it’s necessary. Your specialist will explain this to you. After the operation a doctor will use a microscope to look for cancer cells in the removed testicle.
This may be the only operation you need. It will not stop you having sex or becoming a dad in the future.
Further tests
If testicular cancer is diagnosed you will need some other tests:
more blood tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working, and to check your tumour markers again
chest
X-rays
to check your lungs are healthy – this is sometimes done before the operation
CT
,
MRI
, or
PET scans
to find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of your abdomen (tummy), or to anywhere else in your body
You’ll be seen by a cancer specialist and usually a specialist nurse at a cancer treatment centre to get your test results. The results will help your specialist plan the best treatment for you.
Having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.
If you need any further treatment you will have it at the cancer treatment centre.

Treating testicular cancer
Treatment for testicular cancer can be very successful. Surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. Often people have both treatments.
To make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. The stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. You may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.
Treatment for testicular cancer can be really successful. Most young men with testicular cancer are cured, even if the cancer has spread. If you have any questions about your treatment, don’t be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse.
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer. The operation is called an orchidectomy. It can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital.
You may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect.
The surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. The testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut.
During the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you’ll look the same as before. Your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. If this wasn’t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. It is a small operation to put this in later on.
After the operation
You’ll have a small dressing where the cut was made. This can usually be removed a day or so after the operation. The stitches in the wound will dissolve by themselves over the next few months.
You’ll probably feel a bit sore and you’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if they’re not controlling the pain. Wearing fitted briefs or shorts that support you and loose trousers like jogging bottoms can feel more comfortable after your operation.
You’ll probably feel tired and need to take things easy for about a week. You can expect to make a quick recovery after this operation.
If one of your testicles is removed, you will still be able to have sex and make someone pregnant. Your other testicle should produce enough of the hormone testosterone and sperm.
It isn’t common to have both testicles removed. If you’ve had this done then you’ll be prescribed testosterone so you’ll still be able to have sex. But you won’t be making sperm now, so you won’t be able to make someone pregnant through sex. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking before your surgery. Storing your sperm before the operation can help you to become a dad in the future. Our sections on sex and relationships and fertility have more information as well as ways of coping.
Surveillance
If after surgery the chance of the cancer coming back is very low, your doctor might suggest you have surveillance. This means having regular checks to look for signs of the cancer coming back. If it does come back and it’s picked up very early, then it’s easy to cure. If the cancer doesn’t come back then you’ve avoided having unnecessary treatment. At each clinic appointment, your doctor will examine you and you may have blood tests and chest X-rays.
Going to all your surveillance appointments is really important. You could put a reminder in your phone.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells.
You might be given chemotherapy:
after the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back
to destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle
if the cancer comes back
occasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spread
Chemotherapy can affect your fertility. Before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. This is called sperm banking. We have more information about fertility issues.
Chemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. You have your chemotherapy through one of the following:
a fine tube called a cannula
a line into a vein in the chest (called a central line)
a line into the arm (PICC line) that leads into a vein in the chest
Find out more about how chemotherapy is given
.
The amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. If the stage is low then you will have 1 to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. If the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you’ll usually have 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy.
The drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. Giving these drugs together is called BEP.
Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment. A cycle usually takes 3 weeks. If you have BEP, you’ll usually spend 3 to 5 days of the first week having your chemotherapy as a day patient, or you might need to stay in hospital overnight. After this you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and again the following week.
If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn’t going away completely with BEP, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given.
Side effects
Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. You will probably have a few side effects, but it’s hard to know exactly how it’s going to be you. Your doctor will do everything they can to treat any side effects you have.
Most side effects are short-term and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common temporary side effects are:
hair loss
tiredness
feeling sick or being sick (which can be controlled with medicines)
being more at risk of getting an infection
There’s more information in the
chemotherapy section
.
Sometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, although chemotherapy usually only affects fertility for a year or so, sometimes it’s permanent. Read Macmillan’s
fertility section
for more information.
There may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.
Further surgery
If the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy area are still swollen after chemotherapy, they’re usually removed with an operation. Lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. The lymph nodes in the tummy are called the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, so the operation is called a ‘retroperitoneal lymph node dissection’. The operation will be done by experienced surgeons in specialist centres.
The lymph nodes might contain cells that could become cancerous in the future, so having them removed is the only certain way to find this out.
You might be in hospital for up to 10 days. The surgeon usually makes a cut from the top of your tummy (near your breastbone) to below your belly button. This leaves you with a scar but it’ll gradually fade until it ends up looking like a fine line.
Sometimes you have surgery to remove any abnormal cells in areas like the lung or the lymph nodes in the chest.
After the operation
You’ll have a drip in your arm to give you fluids until you’re able to eat and drink normally. You’ll also have drainage tubes from the wound to stop any extra fluid collecting. The nurses will keep a check on the dressing over your wound and change it when needed. You’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Your staples (like metal stitches) are removed 7 to 10 days after the operation.
It might take a few months to get back to the level of fitness you had before.
This operation can affect your fertility, because the nerves that control the release of sperm (ejaculation) may be damaged by surgery. Surgeons use ‘nerve-sparing’ techniques to try to stop this happening. The operation doesn’t usually stop you getting an erection or having an orgasm.
If you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general
testicular cancer section
.
Life after treatment for testicular cancer
Being diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you’ve finished
treatment
.
After treatment
Once you finish your treatment, you’ll have regular follow-up appointments at the hospital. You’ll have blood tests for tumour markers and sometimes other scans or X-rays. If the tumour markers go up, this can be a sign that the cancer has come back. This means you need more treatment, which can still cure the cancer.
How will I feel?
You might find it embarrassing to talk about your private parts and how the cancer or cancer treatment has affected them. It can feel awkward talking to doctors or your family about this.
Try not to let this put you off talking about things. It can be really helpful to let someone know how you’re feeling, so that you don’t bottle things up.
Sex and fertility
Fertility is the ability to have children. Some cancers and cancer treatments can affect a young man’s fertility, but your doctors will always think about this when planning your treatment. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking prior to treatment if this might happen.
If only 1 of your testicles has been removed, the one left should continue to make sperm and produce enough testosterone so that your fertility is not affected. You can still have sex.
If you have chemotherapy, your ability to produce sperm might be affected. After chemotherapy you can have a sample checked to see if this has happened. You can still have sex, but when you are on chemotherapy (and for a few months afterwards) you should always wear a condom to protect your partner from the chemotherapy.
If you had an operation to remove both of your testicles or the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy (abdomen), your fertility and your ability to have sex may be affected. This is a really tough thing to cope with on top of everything else that you’re going through. Your specialist nurse will provide support and help you find more advice and support if you feel you need it. There are things which can be done to help so that you can still have sex.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/post-polio-syndrome/,"Post-polio syndrome
Post-polio syndrome is a slow progressive condition that affects some people that have had
polio
. It’s not life threatening but it can cause problems in your ability to carry out daily activities.
Polio
is a serious viral infection that used to be common in the UK and worldwide. It’s rarer now because it can be prevented with vaccination.
In around 1 in 100 people, the polio virus causes paralysis, which in rare cases can be life threatening.
Cases of polio in the UK fell dramatically when routine vaccination was introduced in the mid-1950s.
Symptoms of post-polio syndrome
The symptoms of post-polio syndrome include:
muscle weakness
shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)
tight joints (contractures)
pain in muscles or joints
chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue
swallowing and speech problems
respiratory problems like breathlessness and
sleep apnoea
cramps and muscle twitching
being sensitive to cold temperatures
The muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. Sometimes it affects other muscles.
This can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair.
Chronic fatigue is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of post-polio syndrome. This can be physical fatigue (tiredness) and brain fatigue. Brain fatigue can cause problems with concentration, attention and memory.
MRI scans
can show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue.
The symptoms can gradually get worse over many years. There are supportive treatments that can help with symptoms.
Although post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems like
chest infections
.
Some people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia.
Causes of post-polio syndrome
Post-polio syndrome is caused by the polio virus. It only affects people who’ve had polio although it can take 15 – 40 years after the infection for it to develop. It’s not known if there’s anything that can be done to prevent it.
The exact cause behind who’ll experience post-polio syndrome after having the polio virus is unclear.
It could be because of gradual degeneration (breaking down) of nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brainstem or spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. This gradual change explains why it can take years for post-polio syndrome symptoms to appear.
During recovery from polio, surviving motor neurone cells grow new nerve ends to connect with other muscle fibres. This helps to regain muscle strength as someone recovers from the polio virus.
Over time, these new nerve ends put the motor neurone cell under stress. The cells slowly break down, resulting in the loss of muscle strength.
People who have had severe polio at a young age or during adolescence (teenage years) might be more likely to experience post-polio syndrome. People who had a more serious infection in early adulthood are also more likely to develop post-polio syndrome.
Post-polio syndrome is not contagious.
Diagnosis of post-polio syndrome
It can be difficult to diagnose post-polio syndrome. There are no specific tests for it, and it can be mistaken for other conditions.
Your GP might suspect post-polio syndrome if:
you had polio followed by a long period of stable symptoms (usually 15 years)
your symptoms have developed gradually
The symptoms of post-polio syndrome are slow and progressive. The sudden appearance of symptoms is more likely to be caused by something else. A prolonged period of bed rest as a result of another illness or serious injury can trigger post-polio syndrome symptoms.
There are some tests that can be done to rule out conditions with similar symptoms.
You might be offered
blood tests
and scans of your spine.
Other tests that might be offered include:
electromyography (EMG) tests – these will measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles and detect damage that may have been caused by having polio
sleep studies – if you’re experiencing
sleep apnoea
or you’re feeling unusually tired
tests to check your heart function and heart rate
a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan or
computerised tomography (CT) scan
of your brain, spine and muscles
lung function tests like a spirometry to measure your breathing
test to investigate
dysphagia
(swallowing problems)
Treatment of post-polio syndrome
As there’s no cure for post-polio syndrome, treatment will help you manage your symptoms and quality of life.
It’s likely you’ll have a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working together to care for you including:
neurologists
respiratory specialists
physiotherapists
orthotists
psychologists
pain management specialists
occupational therapists
They’ll discuss the most suitable plan for your care which might include a mixture of the following:
Exercise and rest
Exercise can help slow down the progressive muscle weakness that post-polio syndrome causes. However, being active can become difficult because your symptoms might become worse after exercise or activity. Any exercise should be pain free because too much exercise can cause more damage. You should pace yourself to avoid becoming exhausted from exercise.
Your healthcare team might suggest you try using pacing techniques. This might involve:
prioritising tasks
finding different ways of doing tasks which prevent pain or exhaustion
getting help from others to do particularly exhausting tasks
taking regular breaks and having rest periods regularly throughout your day
doing some regular gentle exercise that you can gradually build up and stopping before you become exhausted
Pacing can help you prevent becoming worn out. It can help to space out activities throughout the day to allow for rest periods where you can recover in between.
Making effective and efficient use of your muscles and strength in this way can help them to last longer.
Painkillers
Medication to relieve pain might be used in addition to pacing techniques. Your healthcare team might suggest over the counter painkillers like aspirin,
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
. Other stronger anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates might be considered too depending on individual needs.
Talk to your GP if you’re taking over the counter medicines as they shouldn’t be used long term. They can cause complications like stomach ulcers if taken over a long period of time.
Your healthcare team or GP might suggest medication like gabapentin or pregabalin for your pain if over the counter medications aren’t working.
When taking medication for your pain, you might not feel the damage being caused to your muscles and joints through too much activity. This means it’s important you follow your pacing routine even when you don’t feel tired or aren’t in any pain.
Mobility aids
You might benefit from a mobility aid like:
braces to support weakened muscles and joints, prevent falls and improve posture
walking sticks
to help you balance and prevent falls
an electric scooter
a wheelchair
Your healthcare team will discuss the most suitable options for you depending on your needs. Many mobility aids are provided for free by the NHS.
Treatment of breathing problems
If you have breathing problems, you might benefit from treatment or lifestyle changes.
Your breathing problems will be assessed to identify the cause. For example, your breathing problems might be caused by stiff ribs, scoliosis or weak respiratory muscles. Finding the cause will help to choose the correct treatment for you.
You might be offered a machine to deliver pressurised air into your lungs through a mask during sleep. This is to help stop your airways closing if you have
sleep apnoea
.
There are exercises you can do to increase the strength of your breathing muscles. A respiratory physiotherapist will help you to find suitable and safe exercises for you.
Your healthcare team might suggest you have the
pneumococcal vaccination
,
COVID-19 vaccines
and annual
flu jab
. This is to reduce your risk of getting
chest infections
which can cause further complications.
If you smoke,
stopping smoking
can help improve your breathing too.
Healthy eating and weight control
If you’re overweight, you might be putting your weakened muscles under further pressure. This can cause problems with your energy levels and overall health.
Losing weight (if you’re overweight) can help improve your symptoms and general health.
Your healthcare team can tell you about specific exercises suitable for you.
Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help you reduce and control your weight. It’ll also improve your general health. Following a plan that includes healthy foods that provide energy that’s released slowly over time can help improve your symptoms.
Read our Eatwell Guide: How to eat a healthy balanced diet
Coping with psychological factors
The symptoms of post-polio syndrome can be distressing.
Developing post-polio syndrome after living with the polio virus as a child can cause anxiety, isolation and stress. This can lead to
depression
.
Speak to your GP if you’re feeling down and you no longer enjoy things you used to."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/glands/swollen-glands/,"Swollen glands
Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection. Swollen lymph glands that are caused by an infection usually get better by themselves in 1 to 2 weeks.
Sometimes swollen lymph glands can have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor.
Phone 111 or ask for an urgent GP appointment if:
You have swollen glands and you:
are finding it very difficult to swallow
have difficulty breathing
Speak to your GP practice if:
You have swollen glands and:
they’re getting bigger
they’ve not gone down within 1 week
they feel hard or do not move when you press them
you’re having night sweats or have a very high temperature (you feel hot and shivery)
you have no other signs of illness or infection
you have swollen lymph glands just above or below your collar bone (the bone that runs from your breastbone to each of your shoulders)
What are the lymph glands?
The lymph glands (or lymph nodes) are small lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells. These help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. They’re an important part of the immune system and are found throughout the body.
What swollen lymph glands feel like
The lymph glands can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease.
Swollen glands feel like tender, painful lumps. You may feel them:
on each side of the neck
under the chin
in the armpits
around the groin
Common causes of swollen glands
Swollen glands are usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection like:
a cold
tonsillitis
glandular fever
a throat infection
an ear infection
a dental abscess
cellulitis (a skin infection)
The glands in the affected area will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have other symptoms like a sore throat, cough, or fever.
These infections usually clear up on their own and the swollen glands will soon go down.
Swollen lymph glands are rarely caused by anything more serious.
Managing swollen glands at home
When an infection causes swollen glands you can help to ease symptoms at home.
Do
drink plenty of fluids
rest
use over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/streptococcus-a-strep-a/,"Streptococcus A (strep A)
Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Strep A, are bacteria commonly found on the skin or in the throat. Under some circumstances these bacteria can cause disease.
GAS infection commonly presents as a mild sore throat (‘strep throat’) and skin/soft tissue infections such as impetigo and cellulitis.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child is having difficulty breathing (you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs)
there are pauses when you or your child breathes
you or your child’s skin, tongue or lips are blue
you or your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
Contact your GP if you or your child:
is getting worse
is feeding or eating much less than normal
is showing signs of dehydration, like sunken eyes, drowsiness
has not passed urine for 12 hours
is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38°C
is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C or higher
feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
is very tired or irritable
If your GP is closed, phone the 111 service.
If you feel that you or your child is seriously unwell, trust your own judgement and seek medical assistance.
Strep A tests are not available through the NHS in Scotland for self-testing at home. Should you or your child need to be tested for Strep A, your GP or other healthcare professional will advise you.
GAS infections
GAS bacteria can cause a wide variety of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. These include:
tonsillitis
sore throat
scarlet fever
impetigo
erysipelas (a type of cellulitis)
cellulitis
pneumonia
In rare cases, patients may go on to develop post-streptococcal complications, such as:
rheumatic fever
glomerulonephritis (heart and kidney diseases caused by an immune reaction to the bacteria)​
iGAS infections
GAS can very rarely cause more serious conditions, known as invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections. These can include:
bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream)
septic arthritis
meningitis
necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin)
Streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome
(rapidly progressive symptoms with low blood pressure and multi-organ failure)
iGAS infections tend to happen in the elderly, the very young, or people with an underlying risk factor such as injecting drug use, alcoholism, immunosuppression or cancer.
Treating GAS infections
Most GAS infections are relatively mild illnesses that clear up on their own without the need for antibiotics.
Often symptoms that look like GAS infections, like
sore throats
, are more commonly caused by viruses than GAS bacteria. If you or your child has a runny nose with their sore throat, it’s likely to be a virus infection. Sore throats caused by viruses do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless there are concerns about complications.
More about sore throat symptoms, self-care at home, and what to do if your condition worsens
Your healthcare professional will consider antibiotics if they think:
you or your child need medication to get better or to ease symptoms
you or your child are at risk of serious complications from a GAS infection
you or your child has
scarlet fever
If you or your child is prescribed antibiotics, they could be in liquid or pill form.
It’s not uncommon for someone to have GAS bacteria on their skin or in their throat without being unwell. These people often don’t know they have the bacteria and won’t need antibiotics.
Preventing GAS infection
GAS are spread by close contact between individuals, through respiratory droplets (moisture in your breath) and direct skin contact.
To help reduce the risk of picking up or spreading infections:
Do
wash your hands properly with soap for 20 seconds
use a disposable tissue to catch coughs and sneezes and wash your hands afterwards
keep away from others if you feel unwell
Don’t
do not share contaminated food, utensils, cups and glasses, baths, bed linen or towels
GAS can be a secondary infection, developing in people who are already unwell with illnesses like the flu. You can help protect your child from this risk by making sure they get their free
flu vaccine
this winter.
New evidence
also shows that the nasal spray flu vaccine offered to children may also protect them from GAS infection."

About thirst
About thirst
Feeling thirsty all the time and for no good reason isn’t normal and should be investigated by your GP.
Thirst is normally just the brain’s way of warning that you’re
dehydrated
because you’re not drinking enough fluid. But excessive and persistent thirst (known as polydipsia) could be a sign of an underlying problem such as
diabetes
.
Common causes of thirst
Dehydration
You will usually feel thirsty because you’re not drinking the amount of fluid your body needs. This may be because you’ve been sweating heavily or you’ve lost fluid because you have
diarrhoea
and are
vomiting
.
You can soon quench your thirst and restore the fluid balance in your body by having a drink and ensuring you remain well hydrated.
It’s particularly important to stay well hydrated during hot weather, while exercising and while you’re unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea.
Food
In some cases, thirst may be caused by something as simple as a recent meal or snack. Eating salty or spicy foods can cause you to suddenly feel thirsty.
Diabetes
If you feel thirsty all the time, it could be a sign of diabetes – particularly if you also have other symptoms such as needing to urinate frequently, extreme tiredness (fatigue) and unexplained weight loss.
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that makes it difficult to control the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The high levels of glucose can mean your kidneys need to produce more urine to help pass the glucose out of your body. This can make you feel thirsty because your brain is telling you to drink more to make up for the fluids you’ve lost.
If you feel thirsty all the time and have other symptoms, your GP will probably carry out a blood glucose test to see whether you have diabetes.
Pregnancy
Feeling thirsty, as well as urinating more often than usual, is a common symptom in pregnancy and usually nothing to worry about.
Very occasionally, these problems can be a sign of gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy). You should be screened for this as part of your
antenatal care
if you’re at risk.
Medication
Excessive thirst can sometimes be a side effect of certain types of medication, including lithium, certain antipsychotics and diuretics (water tablets).
If you think a particular medicine is causing your thirst, it may be possible to change to a different medicine or reduce your dose. Speak to your GP about this.
Other causes of thirst
There are also many other potential causes of severe thirst. These include:
diabetes insipidus
– a condition caused by problems with a hormone that regulates the amount of fluid in the body
diabetic ketoacidosis
– a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of the hormone insulin in the body
sickle cell aneamia – an inherited blood disorder
psychogenic polydipsia – where a person with a mental health condition, such as
schizophrenia
, drinks excessive amounts of water that can’t be excreted (got rid of) by the kidneys
excessive bleeding"

Introduction
The thyroid and types of thyroid cancer
Having tests for thyroid cancer
Treating thyroid cancer
Introduction
This section is for teens and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.
If you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our
thyroid cancer
section.
Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are the most common types of thyroid cancer in young adults. If you’d like to find out about a different type of thyroid cancer you could
talk to Macmillan Cancer Support
.
It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured.
Symptoms
The first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger.
Less common symptoms are:
a hoarse voice that doesn’t get better
difficulty swallowing or breathing
If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to speak to a doctor.
Remember – these symptoms can happen for lots of reasons other than cancer.
What are the causes of thyroid cancer?
It’s unknown exactly what causes thyroid cancer. But research into possible causes is going on all the time. Some things called risk factors increase your chance of developing cancer. But having these doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer.
Genes
Genes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.
Radiotherapy
If you were exposed to radiation or had
radiotherapy
treatment to the neck area when you were younger, you may be at a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer many years later.
If you’re worried about thyroid cancer
If you think you might have some of these symptoms you should go straight to your GP. They’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do
tests
to find out more.
The thyroid and types of thyroid cancer
The thyroid is a small gland in the front of the neck just below the voice box (larynx). It is made up of 2 parts, or lobes, 1 on each side of the neck. It’s part of a network of glands throughout the body that make up the endocrine system. This system is responsible for producing the body’s hormones that help to control and influence various body functions.
The thyroid produces 2 hormones:
thyroid hormone that controls your metabolism
calcitonin that helps to control the calcium levels in your body
Types of thyroid cancer
There are 4 main types of thyroid cancer:
papillary is the most common type of thyroid cancer – it’s usually slow-growing
follicular is the second most common type – it’s also usually slow-growing
medullary is a rare type of thyroid cancer which sometimes runs in families
anaplastic is another rare type of thyroid cancer, which is more common in older people
Young people are mostly affected by the papillary and follicular types.
Rarely other types of cancer occur in the thyroid gland such as lymphoma, or other cancers that have spread from another part of the body.
This section is for teens and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.
If you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our

Having tests for thyroid cancer
This information is for teenagers and young adults who may be having tests to find out if they have thyroid cancer.
If you think you might have some of the
symptoms of thyroid cancer
, you should talk to your GP. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do tests to find out more.
Visiting your GP
When you go to your GP they will usually examine you and arrange some blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you have these symptoms. If your GP is concerned that you may have thyroid cancer they will make an appointment for you with a specialist at the hospital.
At the hospital
You’ll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. They work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them.
They may include:
a doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist)
a surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery
a pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases
a cancer specialist (oncologist)
an X-ray specialist (radiologist)
a clinical nurse specialist
Your doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a biopsy.
An FNA involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope.
A biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. You might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. You may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. There is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section.
If the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. Macmillan Cancer Support has information on these tests. These tests may include:
a chest
X-ray
to check your lungs
a
CT
,
MRI
or
PET
scan
a radioisotope scan
You won’t necessarily need all of these tests. It will depend on the results of the first ones.
Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help.
If you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our general
thyroid cancer
information.
Treating thyroid cancer
It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured. If the tests you’ve had show you have thyroid cancer, your team of specialists will discuss treatment with you.
Surgery
Surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for thyroid cancer. You might hear the doctors talk about a thyroidectomy, which is the medical name for the operation. Sometimes the surgeon will only need to remove part of your thyroid.
Lymph nodes
In the neck, close to the thyroid, there are lymph nodes. These are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. Sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. They may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there.
After the operation
You will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. There will be a scar on your neck – usually just above the collarbone. Sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. You may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone.
The tissue removed will be carefully looked at under the microscope. Sometimes another operation is needed after this. The results will help your doctors decide if you need radioactive iodine treatment and other treatments. Your team will talk through the results of the operation with you.
You may feel really shocked and scared by the thought of having this operation. But it does give a really good chance of a cure. Your specialist will talk things over with you in detail and make sure that you fully understand what’s involved. If you want to know more about what happens when you go in for an operation, there’s lots more information in the general surgery section.
Radioactive iodine
If you’ve been told that you need to have treatment with radioactive iodine, you may be worried about what’s going to happen. Knowing what to expect can help.
Your doctors and nurses will also explain things to you and give you support.
How does it work?
There’s a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. Normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too.
Radioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. Any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. This helps to destroy them. Radioactive iodine doesn’t usually affect other parts of the body because other cells don’t take up iodine the way thyroid cells do.
How is it given?
You may have radioactive iodine as a capsule, as a drink or as an injection into a vein in your arm through a cannula.
Preparing for treatment
There are 2 ways to prepare your body for the radioiodine treatment, either you’ll:
be given an injection of a drug called thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen
®
)
need to stop taking your thyroid hormone tablets 2 to 4 weeks before the treatment
Some people won’t be started on thyroid hormones until after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. You’ll probably feel very tired during this time. But, if you are not having the injections, it’s important that you stop taking thyroid hormones or the radioactive iodine treatment won’t work.
For 2 weeks before treatment, you’ll be asked to eat a low-iodine diet and avoid certain foods. This encourages the body to use up its stores of iodine. Then when the radioactive iodine is given, the cancer cells will soak it up because the amount of iodine in the body is so low. You’ll be given information about what foods you should eat and what to avoid.
You can’t have this treatment if you are pregnant. If there is any chance of this tell your team and they can test you.
What happens during treatment?
This treatment makes you slightly radioactive for several weeks. Your body will gradually get rid of the radioactivity through your wee, sweat and saliva. You will be kept in hospital when the radioactivity is highest, which is usually between 1 to 5 days. You will be looked after in a side room on the ward, either on your own or with someone else having the same treatment.
During this treatment, the amount of contact you can have with your friends, family and the nurses will be limited, to protect them from exposure to the radiation. Anyone pregnant or younger than 18 usually isn’t allowed to visit. This can make you feel lonely. You will be able to keep in touch with your friends and family by phone and internet. There should be plenty of books, magazines, DVDs, computer games and a TV in the room. You can take in a few of your own things in to help pass the time. Ask your team whether you can take a computer or an MP3 player into the room with you. Anything that comes back out of your room will be checked for radiation levels. Sometimes your things may have to be kept on the ward for a while if the radiation levels are high. But they’ll be returned to you when they’re safe again.
What happens after treatment?
Once your radiation levels are safe, you’ll be allowed home. You’ll also be able to start eating your usual foods again. Check with the staff about what you can and can’t do when you get home. There are likely to be some precautions to take for up to a few weeks.
You might need a scan shortly after your treatment. This shows if you need more radioiodine treatment. If you need more treatment it is usually given every 3 to 6 months.
Your fertility won’t be affected by the treatment. But it’s safer not to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant during treatment, and for a year after. You should avoid all sex and open-mouthed kissing for a few days after treatment.
Travelling on public transport can be restricted just after treatment, so you may not be able to go on holiday just after treatment. For a few months after treatment you might set off the alarms at the security gates. If you are planning a holiday, discuss it with your team.
External beam radiotherapy
You may also have external beam radiotherapy. For this treatment you come to hospital and lie on a bed in the radiotherapy department for about 10 to 20 minutes every day. You will have treatment every weekday for several weeks. It is like having an X-ray, so it doesn’t hurt and you cannot feel it.
Hormone therapy after treatment for thyroid cancer
If you’ve had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can’t produce thyroid hormones anymore. Without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy.
What can help?
These hormones can be replaced by taking tablets. You’ll need to take them for the rest of your life. The usual long-term hormone treatment is thyroxine (levothyroxine) and you normally start taking it once your radioactive iodine treatment is finished.
As well as replacing the hormones you’re missing, thyroxine can also help stop papillary or follicular thyroid cancer coming back. So if you have only had part of your thyroid gland removed you may still need to take thyroid hormone tablets.
Blood tests
You’ll need to have your
blood
checked regularly to monitor the hormone levels. It can sometimes take months to find the right dose of thyroxine for you. But once the right dose is found, there shouldn’t be any side effects, because they are simply replacing normal thyroid hormones.
It’s important to remember to take your tablets every day. It can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/tinnitus/,"Tinnitus
Tinnitus is the name for hearing sounds that come from inside your body rather than an outside source.
It’s not usually a sign of anything serious and may get better by itself.
Symptoms of tinnitus
Tinnitus is often called ‘ringing in the ears’ but it’s not just ringing. You might hear:
buzzing
humming
grinding
hissing
whistling
music or singing
noises that beat in time with your pulse
You may also notice hearing loss or that you’re more sensitive to everyday sounds.
For some people, tinnitus may come and go. But sometimes it can impact your daily life and be very distressing. It can affect concentration and cause difficulty sleeping
(insomnia)
and
depression
.
Tinnitus will sometimes get better over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears
your tinnitus is getting worse
your tinnitus is bothering you – for example, it’s affecting your sleep or concentration, or is making you feel anxious and depressed
you have tinnitus that beats in time with your pulse
Diagnosing tinnitus
Your doctor can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an
ear infection
or
earwax build-up
. They can also check if you have any
hearing loss
.
If needed, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
What causes tinnitus?
Tinnitus can develop slowly over time or happen suddenly.
It’s not known exactly why it happens but it’s often linked to:
hearing loss
inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises or some medicines
an
earwax build-up
a
middle ear infection
Ménière’s disease
– a condition that also causes hearing loss and
vertigo
(a spinning sensation)
otosclerosis – an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss
Who is affected?
Most people have tinnitus for a short time after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert.
Around 1 in 10 people have persistent tinnitus. Around 1 in 100 having severe tinnitus that affects their daily life.
Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children. It’s more common in people aged over 65.
How is tinnitus treated
There’s currently no treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone.
If your tinnitus is caused by an underlying condition, then treating that condition may help your tinnitus.
If a cause can’t be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve:
sound therapy – listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus
counselling – to teach you about tinnitus and help you learn to cope with it better
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable
tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) – to help you start to tune tinnitus out and become less aware of it
Things you can do to help your symptoms
Do
try to relax – deep breathing or yoga may help
try to find ways to improve your sleep, such as sticking to a bedtime routine or cutting down on caffeine
try to avoid things that can make tinnitus worse, such as stress or loud background noises
join a support group – talking to other people with tinnitus may help you cope
Don’t
do not have total silence – listening to soft music or sounds (sound therapy) may distract you from the tinnitus
do not focus on it, as this can make it worse – hobbies and activities may take your mind off it"

About threadworms
Threadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans.
Threadworms are a common type of worm infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of 10.
The worms are white and look like small pieces of thread. You may notice them around your child’s bottom or in their poo.
They don’t always cause symptoms, but people often experience itchiness around their bottom or vagina. It can be worse at night and disturb sleep.
Read more about the
symptoms of threadworms
.
When to seek professional advice
Pharmacy First Scotland: Threadworm treatment from your pharmacy
If you have threadworms you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service Directory.
Search for a pharmacy near you
If you think you or your child may have threadworms, you can usually treat the infection yourself with medication available at pharmacies without a prescription.
You only need to see your GP if you think you have threadworms and you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you think your child has threadworms and they’re under 2 years old. In these circumstances, the recommended treatment is usually different.
Severe or persistent threadworm infections can cause:
loss of appetite
weight loss
skin infection around the anus if bacteria enter any scratches caused by itching – wearing cotton gloves while sleeping may help prevent this
difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep
(insomnia)
bedwetting
In such cases, you should seek further advice from your GP. In very rare cases, threadworms can spread outside the intestine to the urinary tract or liver, or the vagina or womb in girls or women.
How threadworms are spread
Threadworms lay their eggs around an infected person’s anus (bottom), usually at night. Along with the eggs, the worm also secretes a mucus that causes itching.
If the eggs get stuck on the person’s fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. If other people touch an infected surface, they can then transfer the eggs to their mouth.
Threadworm eggs can survive for up to 2 weeks before hatching. If the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. Eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. After 2 weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.
Read more about
what causes threadworms
.
Treating threadworms
If you or your child has threadworms, everyone in your household will need to be treated as there’s a high risk of the infection spreading. This includes those who don’t have any symptoms of an infection.
For most people, treatment will involve taking a single dose of a medication called mebendazole to kill the worms. If necessary, another dose can be taken after 2 weeks.
During treatment and for a few weeks afterwards, it’s also important to follow strict hygiene measures to avoid spreading the threadworm eggs. This includes regularly vacuuming your house and thoroughly washing your bathroom and kitchen.
If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. This is also often the case for young children.
Read more about
treating threadworm infections
.
Preventing threadworms
It’s not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same.
Children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean.
If your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.
Symptoms of threadworms
Threadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them.
However, they can cause intense
itching around the anus
(and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. This can disturb sleep.
In some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1cm long.
Causes of threadworms
A threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs.
A female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina. The female threadworm also releases mucus, which can cause an
itchy bottom
.
Scratching the anus or vagina, or wiping them after going to the toilet, can cause the eggs to stick to your fingertips or under your fingernails.
If you don’t wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. If someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then touches their mouth, they’ll become infected.
After the eggs have been swallowed they pass into a person’s intestine, where they hatch. After about 2  weeks the threadworms will have grown into adults, at which point they’ll reproduce and the cycle of infection will start again.
Transferring eggs
Threadworm eggs can be transferred from your anus (or vagina) to anything you touch, including:
bed sheets and bed clothes
flannels and towels
children’s toys
kitchen utensils
toothbrushes
furniture
kitchen or bathroom surfaces
Threadworm eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks.
As well as being swallowed by a person who touches a contaminated object or surface, threadworm eggs can also be swallowed after being breathed in. This can happen if the eggs become airborne – for example, after shaking a contaminated towel or bed sheet.
Animals and pets
Threadworms only infect humans and aren’t spread in animal faeces. However, there’s a small risk that threadworms can be caught from pets if the animal’s fur becomes contaminated with eggs after an infected person strokes it. If another person then touches the animal’s fur, the eggs could be passed on to them.
Who’s at risk?
Threadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children.
People who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. This is why all members of a household need to be treated when someone has a threadworm infection.
Read more about
treating threadworms
.
Treating threadworms
To treat threadworms successfully, all household members must be treated, even if they don’t have any symptoms. This is because the risk of the infection spreading is very high.
The aim of treatment is to get rid of the threadworms and prevent reinfection. This will usually involve a combination of medication to kill the worms and strict hygiene measures to stop the spread of the eggs.
The main medication used to treat threadworms is available from your local pharmacy without a prescription. However, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions as it isn’t suitable for everyone.
Medication
Mebendazole is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or prescribed by your GP. It’s available as a chewable tablet or a liquid.
Mebendazole works by preventing the threadworms absorbing sugar, which means they should die within a few days.
This medication is 90 to 100% effective at killing the threadworms, but it doesn’t kill the eggs. This is why the hygiene measures outlined below should also be followed for 6 weeks.
Visit your pharmacist if the infection continues two weeks after treatment. They may recommend a second dose of medication.
In rare cases, mebendazole can cause abdominal pain or
diarrhoea
, particularly if the threadworm infection is severe.
Hygiene measures
Strict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection.
The lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6 weeks, so it’s important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. Everyone in the household must follow the advice outlined below.
wash all night clothes, bed linen, towels and soft toys when you’re first diagnosed – this can be done at normal temperatures, but make sure the washing is well rinsed
thoroughly vacuum and dust the whole house, paying particular attention to the bedrooms – this should be repeated regularly
carefully clean the bathroom and kitchen by damp-dusting surfaces and washing the cloth frequently in hot water – this should be repeated regularly
avoid shaking any material that may be contaminated with eggs, such as clothing or bed sheets – this will prevent eggs being transferred to other surfaces
don’t eat food in the bedroom – you may end up swallowing eggs that have been shaken off the bedclothes
keep your fingernails short – encourage other members of your household to do the same
discourage nail-biting and sucking fingers – in particular, make sure children don’t suck their thumb
wash your hands frequently and scrub under your fingernails – it’s particularly important to do this before eating, after going to the toilet, and before and after changing your baby’s nappy
wear close-fitting underwear at night and change your underwear every morning
bathe or shower regularly – it’s particularly important to bathe or shower first thing in the morning: make sure you clean around your anus and vagina to remove any eggs
ensure everyone in your household has their own face flannel and towel – don’t share towels
keep toothbrushes in a closed cupboard and rinse them thoroughly before use
Children can easily pick up another threadworm infection from friends or at school, so maintaining good hygiene may help prevent reinfection.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women
Medication isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Instead, you should follow the hygiene measures above.
See your GP if you’re more than 3 months pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding and you continue to experience problems after only taking hygiene measures. In certain circumstances, your GP may consider prescribing medication.
Children under 2 years old
Make sure you wash your baby’s bottom gently but thoroughly every time you change their nappy. Also wash your hands thoroughly before and after changing their nappy.
Mebendazole isn’t licensed for use in children under 2 years of age, but GPs may decide to prescribe it off-label for children over 6 months.
If medication isn’t used, the hygiene measures outlined above are recommended instead."

Tonsillitis is an infection that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the tonsils.
Tonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults.
What are the tonsils?
The tonsils are 2 small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight germs and act as a barrier against infection.
When the tonsils become infected, they stop it spreading further into the body.
As a child’s immune system gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually get smaller. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.
Sore throat self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Symptoms of tonsillitis
The symptoms of tonsillitis include:
a
sore throat
pain when swallowing
earache
high temperature (fever) over 38°C (100.4°F)
coughing
headache
feeling sick
feeling tired
swollen, painful lymph glands in your neck
white pus-filled spots on the tonsils
bad breath
loss of voice or changes to your voice
Symptoms usually get better within 3 to 4 days.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
symptoms last longer than 4 days and don’t show any signs of getting better
symptoms are severe – for example, if you’re unable to eat or drink due to the pain, or you have difficulty breathing
you keep getting throat infections
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.
Diagnosing tonsillitis
If needed, your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. They may take a swab of your throat to check if its caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It’ll usually take a few days to get your results.
If you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a
blood test
for
glandular fever.
Treating tonsillitis
There’s no specific treatment for tonsillitis. It usually gets better on its own within a week.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
Do
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to help relieve pain
drink plenty of fluids
get plenty of rest
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child,
speak to a pharmacist
for advice.
Treatments from your doctor
If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral
antibiotics
may be prescribed.
If oral antibiotics do not help and your symptoms are getting worse, your GP may refer you to hospital for antibiotics to be given into a vein (IV antibiotics).
Surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy)
A small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is called chronic tonsillitis and surgery may be needed.
Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended if:
you’ve had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time
repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities
What causes tonsillitis?
Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as
cold
or
flu
.
Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called
group A streptococcus
bacteria.
Tonsillitis itself isn’t contagious, but the infections that cause it are.
How to prevent infections spreading
Do
wash your hands often, especially after touching your nose or mouth and before handling food
always sneeze and cough into tissues
throw used tissues away and wash your hands
Complications of tonsillitis
Complications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it’s caused by a bacterial infection. They’re usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body.
Possible complications of tonsillitis include:
quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) – an abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
– where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and poor sleep
Other complications of tonsillitis are very rare. They usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/toothache/,"Toothache
If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always
phone the dental practice that you normally attend
.
If you are not registered with any dental practice then
your nearest dental practice
will still be able to help.
Toothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that’s usually caused by tooth decay.
You may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold.
The pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel sharp and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you’re lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain.
It can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it’s coming from the ear.
Toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it’s coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.
The area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch.
It’s also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a dull pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth.
When to see your dentist
If you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get.
If your toothache isn’t treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a
dental abscess
, with severe and continuous throbbing pain.
Painkillers, such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you’re waiting for an appointment. Children under 16 years of age shouldn’t be given aspirin.
Find a dentist near you
What causes toothache?
Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels.
Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of:
tooth decay
– this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth
a cracked tooth – the crack is often so small that it can’t be seen with the naked eye
loose or broken fillings
receding gums – where the gums shrink (contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root
periapical abscess – a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection
There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn’t affected. These include:
periodontal abscess – a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection
ulcers on your gums
sore or swollen gums around a tooth that’s breaking through – for example, when your wisdom teeth start to come through
sinusitis
– which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw
an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint)
Babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething.
Treating toothache
The type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an
X-ray
to try to identify the problem.
If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling.
If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.
If the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection.
Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can’t be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).
Preventing toothache
The best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should:
limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks – you should have these as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar
brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains
fluoride
– gently brush your gums and tongue as well
clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash
stop smoking – smoking can make some dental problems worse
Make sure you have regular
dental check-ups
, preferably with the same dentist.
The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems.
Your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health.
Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early.

Lumps and swellings in the testicles (balls) are relatively common in boys, men and anyone with testicles.
It’s important to know what’s normal for you so you can notice any changes in your testicles.
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if you have:
a lump in your testicles
swollen testicles
a change in the shape of your testicles
a change in the way your testicles feel
1 testicle that has become bigger than the other
aching or discomfort in your testicles that does not go away
Diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings
There is not a singular test for testicular lumps and swellings. The doctor will discuss your situation and carry out a physical examination.
Your doctor may:
look at and feel your testicles
shine a torch through the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) to check for a build-up of fluid
refer you for an
ultrasound scan
take a urine (pee) sample if they suspect your lump or swelling may be caused by an infection
If the lump or swelling is painful or very big, your doctor may refer you to a specialist for an operation to drain, shrink or remove it.
What causes testicular lumps and swellings?
Lumps and swellings in the testicles can have lots of different causes.
The vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by non-cancerous (benign) conditions. Most of these may not need treatment.
If you experience testicular lumps and swellings, they may be caused by:
varicoceles – soft lumps that develop gradually above the testicle and on the left side of the scrotum
hydroceles – swellings in the scrotum caused by a build-up of fluid
epididymal cysts – a small, smooth fluid-filled swelling that slowly develops in the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm)
epididymo-orchitis – inflammation in the epididymis and the testicle caused by bacterial infections such as
urinary tract infections (UTIs)
, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
mumps
inguinal hernias – when fatty tissue or part of the bowel pokes through into the groin at the top of the inner thigh
testicular torsion– a benign but serious condition caused by the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies blood to the testicles) becoming severely twisted
testicular cancer
– a more serious health condition
Treatment for testicular lumps and swellings
Treatment for testicular lumps and swellings will vary depending on what’s causing it.
Painkillers such as
paracetamol
can be taken to ease discomfort or pain.
In some cases, surgery may be used to treat some testicular lumps and swellings. The surgery is carried out under either
local anaesthetic
or
general anaesthetic
depending on the procedure.
Antibiotics
may be prescribed if the cause is a bacterial infection.
If you have been diagnosed with
testicular cancer
, you will be cared for by a team of clinicians who will help decide the best treatment for you. Surgery to remove the affected testicle will be recommended in most cases and this may sometimes be followed by a course of
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy

Thrush is a very common yeast infection. It’s not a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
It’s usually harmless but it can be uncomfortable and keep coming back.
Symptoms of thrush
Some people won’t have any signs or symptoms of thrush at all.
Sometimes there can be too much yeast and it can cause symptoms.
Thrush symptoms in women
Symptoms of thrush in women include:
white
vaginal discharge
(often like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell
itching and irritation around the vagina
soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee
Thrush symptoms in men
Symptoms of thrush in men include:
irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
a white discharge (like cottage cheese)
an unpleasant smell
difficulty pulling back the foreskin
Thrush in other areas
Thrush can affect other areas of skin, including the armpits, groin and between your fingers.
Symptoms of thrush in other areas include:
a red itchy or painful rash (the rash might not be easy to see on darker skin)
white or yellow discharge
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if:
you have symptoms of thrush for the first time
you have thrush and are under 16 or over 60
thrush keeps coming back (more than 4 times in 12 months)
treatment for thrush has not worked
you have thrush and are pregnant or breastfeeding
you have thrush and a weakened immune system – for example, because of
diabetes
,
HIV
or
chemotherapy
Testing for thrush
If you think you might have thrush, get tested for free by:
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
Testing is also available in some
pharmacies
.
What does a thrush test involve?
The test for thrush only takes a few seconds and isn’t usually painful, though it may be uncomfortable for a moment.
It’s not always necessary to have a test for thrush. If you do have a test, a doctor or nurse may:
look at the genital area
use a swab (cotton bud) to collect a sample from the parts of the body that could be affected such as the vagina
Thrush may have similar symptoms to some STIs, so it’s important you seek advice if you think you may be at risk of an STI.
Treatment for thrush
Treatment is simple and only necessary if you have signs and symptoms of thrush.
You may be given:
antifungal cream to apply to the genital area
vaginal pessaries (tablets that you put into your vagina)
oral pills
a combination of treatments
Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to use the treatment.
It’s very important to take the treatment as instructed and finish any course of treatment even if the symptoms go away earlier.
You can buy antifungal treatments from most
pharmacies
if you’ve been diagnosed with thrush in the past and you know the symptoms.
Some antifungal products can weaken latex
condoms
,
diaphragms
and
caps
. You should avoid sex while undergoing treatment if this is your method of contraception.
You should tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you’re pregnant, might be pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding. This may affect the type of treatment you’re given.
If thrush isn’t treated it eventually goes away on its own.
There’s no need for your partner(s) to have treatment unless they have signs and symptoms of thrush.
What causes thrush?
Your chances of developing thrush increase if:
your skin is irritated or damaged
you’re taking
antibiotics
you have poorly controlled diabetes
you have a weakened immune system – for example you’re having
chemotherapy
or living with
HIV
you’re having
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
you’re pregnant
you use products that irritate the skin such as perfumed products, bubble baths or vaginal washing products
How to prevent thrush
Some people find that different triggers cause thrush. If you notice a pattern, you may be able to help control it.
There are things you can do to relieve symptoms and stop thrush from coming back.
Do
use a soap substitute (emollient) to add moisture instead of soap – these are available in some pharmacies
use non-soap bath additives such as unfragranced bath oil instead of bubble bath
dry properly after washing
wear cotton underwear
avoid sex until thrush has cleared up if sex is uncomfortable
if you do have sex, make sure your vagina is well-lubricated
Don’t
do not use soaps on or near your genital area, it can be drying
do not let products like shampoo or conditioner run onto your genital area
do not use bubble baths, essential oils or soap or shower gels in the bath as they’ll run onto the genital skin and cause irritation
do not use wet wipes on the genital skin
do not use feminine washing products – even if they say they are pH balanced as they disrupt healthy bacteria in the vagina
do not ‘douche’ (wash out the vagina with water or other products) as it damages the healthy vaginal organisms and changes their natural balance
do not wear tight underwear, tights, tight trousers or jeans
do not use fabric softeners
If you’re prescribed an antibiotic for another condition, remind your doctor that you tend to get thrush and ask for some preventive treatment for thrush at the same time.
Regular thrush
Some people may only get thrush once. Others may get it multiple times.
You may need to take treatment for longer if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).
If you get recurrent thrush the doctor or nurse will want to check that other conditions, such as diabetes, aren’t the cause of the thrush.
They’ll recommend how often you should use treatment.

About thyroid cancer
Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck.
The most common symptom of cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck.
Other symptoms only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:
unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks
a
sore throat
or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better
a lump elsewhere in your neck
If you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer. About 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous.
Read more about the
symptoms of thyroid cancer
The thyroid gland
The thyroid gland consists of 2 lobes located on either side of the windpipe. Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body).
The thyroid gland releases 3 separate hormones:
triiodothyronine – known as T3
thyroxine – known as T4
calcitonin
The T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body’s metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt).
An excess of T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you may lose weight. If you don’t have enough of these hormones, you’ll feel sluggish and you may gain weight.
Calcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones.
Calcitonin isn’t essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium.
Types of thyroid cancer
There are 4 main types of thyroid cancer. They are:
papillary carcinoma – this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10 (60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women
follicular carcinoma – accounts for around 3 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults
medullary thyroid carcinoma – accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5% to 8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma can run in families
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma – this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1 in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60
Papillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they’re often treated in the same way.
How common is thyroid cancer?
Thyroid cancer is a rare form of
cancer,
accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK.
It’s most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over.
Women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It’s unclear why this is, but it may be a result of the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system.
What causes thyroid cancer?
In most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.
Risk factors for thyroid cancer include:
having a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition
having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)
having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis
acromegaly – a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone
having a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition
weight and height
radiation exposure
Read more about the
causes of thyroid cancer
Diagnosing thyroid cancer
A type of
blood test
known as a thyroid function test will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems.
If nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used.
Further testing may be required if the FNAC results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective.
Read more about
how thyroid cancer is diagnosed
.
Treating thyroid cancer
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable.
Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of
radiotherapy
that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning.
Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland.
Read more about
treating thyroid cancer
Recurrence
Cancerous cells will return in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones.
Cancerous cells can sometimes return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.
You’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.
Read more about the
complications of thyroid cancer
Preventing thyroid cancer
From the available evidence, eating a
healthy, balanced diet
is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer.
A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains.
Symptoms of thyroid cancer
In its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms.
The main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck just below your Adam’s apple, which is usually painless.
Women also have Adam’s apples, but they’re much smaller and less prominent than a man’s.
The lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection.
Other symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:
unexplained hoarseness that doesn’t get better after a few weeks
a
sore throat
or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better
pain in your neck
When to seek medical advice
You should always speak to your GP if you develop a swelling or lump at the front of your neck. Although it’s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it’s important that it is investigated.
About 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called goitres.
Goitres
A goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as:
too much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones – this is known as having an
overactive thyroid gland
, or hyperthyroidism
not enough T3 and T4 hormones – this is known as having an
underactive thyroid gland
, or hypothyroidism
Thyroid cancer support
The
Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust
provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer.
As well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on 01207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm.
Causes of thyroid cancer
In most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown.
However, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to radiation.
What is cancer?
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body.
Lymph nodes produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence system against infection and illness).
Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.
The most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs).
They spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. When DTCs are diagnosed, they’re usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes.
The rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. By the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. In advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs.
Anaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs.
Risk factors for thyroid cancer
The main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are:
having a thyroid condition
having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)
having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone)
having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions
weight and height
radiation exposure
Thyroid conditions
Your risk of developing thyroid cancer is slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland (thyroiditis) or an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre).
Having an
overactive thyroid gland
(hyperthyroidism) or an
underactive thyroid gland
(hypothyroidism) doesn’t increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer.
Around 1 in 5 cases of thyroid cancer occur in people who’ve had a previous benign thyroid condition.
Family history
Inherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. If the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body’s processes won’t work normally.
This inherited mutation occurs in:
familial medullary thyroid cancer
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, types 2A and 2B
In cases of MEN2A or MEN2B thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. In familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood.
If one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN syndrome, you should consider having a
blood test
to find out whether you have the mutated genes. If your test results are positive, it’s recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution.
Familial adenomatous polyposis
If you have a bowel condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. FAP runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene.
Macmillan Cancer Support have more information about
familial adenomatous polyposis
.
Acromegaly
Thyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly. This is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone.
Previous breast conditions
If you’ve had a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your risk of developing thyroid cancer increases by around half (50%) compared with women who haven’t had this type of condition.
Weight and height
If you’re overweight, you’re more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn’t overweight.
Research has also shown that taller adults have an increased risk. However, the reasons for this are unclear.
Radiation exposure
Exposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer.
Radiation from nuclear fallout and radiation used for medical treatments have both been associated with thyroid cancer.
Many recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960.
During this time, not much was known about the risks of radiation treatment. Today there are much stricter regulations regarding the use of radiation for medical procedures.
Other risk factors
Diet
If your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you’re at an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.
People exposed to radiation, or those with a history of benign thyroid conditions, are more likely to have low levels of iodine.
Eating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. To help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of fresh
fruit and vegetables
in your diet.
People with a high
body mass index (BMI)
also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.
Gender
Women are about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men.
It’s thought this may be because of the hormones released during a woman’s monthly period or during pregnancy. However, there’s little scientific evidence to support this theory.
Diagnosing thyroid cancer
For many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a GP.
Your GP will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness.
Thyroid function test
A blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland.
It will rule out conditions such as an
overactive thyroid gland
(hyperthyroidism) or an
underactive thyroid gland
(hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems.
A thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood.
Further tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. It’s an outpatient procedure, which means you won’t have to spend the night in hospital.
A small needle is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. The sample is then studied under a microscope.
This test can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have.
Further testing
Further testing may be recommended if the FNAC results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. These tests may include:
repeat FNAC combined with an
ultrasound scan
other types of scan, such as a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
In most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling when it hasn’t been possible to rule out thyroid cancer.
Treating thyroid cancer
If you’re diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you’ll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you.
Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.
Cancer treatment team
All NHS hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) that treat thyroid cancer. An MDT is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include:
a surgeon
an endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions)
an oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist)
a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue)
a radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy)
a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your first point of contact with the rest of the team
Deciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours.
Before you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.
Your treatment plan
Your recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including:
the type of thyroid cancer you have
the grade of your cancer
whether your care team thinks a complete cure is realistically achievable
Most differentiated thyroid cancers – papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas – and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure.
Differentiated thyroid cancers are treated using a combination of:
surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy)
a type of radiotherapy called radioactive iodine treatment, which is designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returning
Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes.
Radiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective at treating this type of thyroid cancer.
Stage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren’t usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms.
In most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn’t usually achievable. This is because it’s usually spread to other parts of the body by the time it’s been diagnosed.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms.
Some cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies.
This is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. However, these types of treatments are currently undergoing clinical trials and aren’t offered routinely on the NHS.
Thyroidectomy
In almost all cases of thyroid cancer it’s necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland (total thyroidectomy).
This decision will be influenced by:
the type of thyroid cancer you have
the size of the tumour
whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland
Your surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so you can make an informed decision.
A thyroidectomy is carried out under a
general anaesthetic
and usually takes around 2 hours. The operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which shouldn’t be very noticeable. In a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness.
Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 5 days after having thyroid surgery. However, you’ll need to rest at home for 2 to 3 weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting.
A member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you’ll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work.
Replacement hormone therapy
If some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system.
This means you’ll experience
symptoms of an underactive thyroid
(hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin.
To compensate, you’ll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life.
If your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it’s likely you’ll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine.
After radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you’ll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day.
You’ll need to have regular
blood tests
to check you’re receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted.
It may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. Until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low.
Alternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. You shouldn’t experience any more side effects once the right dose has been achieved.
Calcium levels
Occasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. The parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood.
If your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose.
These symptoms should be reported to your MDT or GP as you may need to take calcium supplements. Most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets as the parathyroid glands will soon start to function normally again.
Radioactive iodine treatment
After having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. This will help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning.
If you’re taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you’ll need to stop taking them for 2 to 4 weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. This is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment.
If withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH). This is given as an injection on 2 consecutive days.
Your MDT will be able to advise you about whether or not rhTSH is suitable for you.
The procedure
Radioactive iodine treatment involves swallowing radioactive iodine in either liquid or capsule form. The radiation in the iodine travels up into your neck through your blood supply and destroys any cancerous cells.
Side effects of radioactive iodine treatment are uncommon, but a small number of people may experience tightness, pain or swelling in their neck and may feel flushed (warm). These side effects usually pass within 24 hours.
After treatment, you may have a
dry mouth
and notice a change in your taste. These symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks or months, although they can be permanent in some people.
You’ll need to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. As a precaution, you’ll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren’t exposed to radiation.
You won’t be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum.
Your bodily fluids, such as urine, will also be slightly radioactive for 3 to 5 days after your treatment, so it’s important that you flush the toilet every time you use it. Your sweat will be radioactive, too, so you should bathe or shower every day.
You’ll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided.
Dietary recommendations
While having radioactive iodine treatment, you’ll need to eat a diet low in iodine. An iodine-rich diet may reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. It’s recommended that you:
avoid all seafood
limit the amount of dairy products you eat
don’t take cough medicines or use sea salt as they both contain iodine
You should eat plenty of fresh meat, fresh
fruit and vegetables
, and pasta and rice. These are all low in iodine.
Pregnancy and breastfeeding
You shouldn’t have radioactive iodine treatment if you’re pregnant or if there’s a good chance that you may be. The treatment could damage your baby.
Tell a member of your care team if you’re unsure whether you’re pregnant. Any treatment will need to be delayed until after your pregnancy.
You must stop breastfeeding before you can be treated with radioactive iodine. If possible, you should stop breastfeeding 6 weeks prior to treatment.
You should not resume breastfeeding after treatment for your current child, but you may safely breastfeed any babies you may have in the future.
Breastfeeding also isn’t recommended while receiving iodine treatment. If you’re breastfeeding, you should stop at least 4 weeks (but preferably 8) before starting iodine treatment.
You should also not resume breastfeeding your baby. However, it’s safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future.
You should use a reliable method of
contraception
for at least 6 months after having iodine treatment. This is because there’s a small risk that any child conceived during this time could develop birth defects. This applies to both men and women.
Fertility
Radioactive iodine treatment doesn’t affect fertility in women. However, there’s a small risk that it could affect fertility in men who need to have multiple treatment sessions. Your care team will be able to advise you about the level of risk in your individual circumstances.
If there’s a significant risk you’ll become infertile after having radioactive iodine treatment, you may wish to consider having your sperm or eggs harvested and frozen so they can be used for fertility treatment at a later date.
External radiotherapy
External
radiotherapy
, where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.
The length of time you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression.
Side effects of radiotherapy include:
nausea
vomiting
tiredness
pain when swallowing
dry mouth
These side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body.
It involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. It’s rarely successful in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms.
Possible side effects of chemotherapy include:
nausea
vomiting
tiredness
loss of appetite
hair loss
mouth ulcers
If you’re receiving chemotherapy, you’ll also be more vulnerable to infection. See your GP if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38C (100.4F).
Targeted therapies
A number of targeted therapies are being tested in clinical trials to treat advanced cases of:
medullary thyroid cancers
differentiated thyroid cancers that don’t respond to radioactive iodine
anaplastic thyroid carcinomas
In targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread.
As research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. In exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. They’ll do this if:
they think it’s likely to be effective
there are no better alternatives
the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks
If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they’ll tell you that it’s unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.
The decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).
Complications of thyroid cancer
Cancerous cells can return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.
It’s estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck.
An estimated 10% to 15% of people will see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones.
Because of the risk of cancer cells returning, you’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly.
Thyroglobulin testing
Thyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that’s used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells.
Thyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells.
If you’ve had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned.
Regularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned.
For the first few years after having surgery you’ll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. After this period, you’ll need to be tested once a year.
Ultrasound scan
An ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. An
ultrasound scan
can detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer.
Radioactive iodine scan
After surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test.
You swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. The radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body.
Before the scan, you’ll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication.
As only a small dose of radioactive iodine is used, it’s not necessary to keep your distance from others. However, if you think you may be pregnant or you’re breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test.
A radioactive iodine scan will usually be carried out 6 to 8 months after surgery."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/transient-ischaemic-attack-tia/,"Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or mini stroke, happens when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.
The disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms like those of a
stroke
.
However, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours.
Phone 999 immediately if:
you suspect you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke
Do not drive if you suspect you have had a stroke or TIA (transient ischaemic attack).
Symptoms of a TIA
Like a stroke, the signs and symptoms of a TIA usually begin suddenly.
The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST.
FAST stands for:
Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop
Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm
Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake
Time – it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms
It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of a stroke or TIA, especially if you live with or care for somebody in a high-risk group, such as an elderly person or someone with
diabetes
or
high blood pressure
.
Symptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes and TIAs. TIAs sometimes cause different symptoms that appear suddenly (usually over a few seconds).
Other signs and symptoms may include:
complete paralysis of one side of the body
sudden loss or blurring of vision
dizziness
confusion
difficulty understanding what others are saying
problems with balance and co-ordination
However, there may be other causes for these symptoms.
During a TIA, it’s not possible to tell whether you’re having a TIA or a full stroke, so it’s important to phone 999 immediately. Even if the symptoms disappear, you should still have an assessment at hospital.
A TIA is a warning that you’re at risk of having a full stroke. An assessment can help doctors decide the best way to reduce the chances of this happening.
Causes of a TIA
TIAs happen when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.
In TIAs, the blockage resolves before any significant damage. A full
stroke
disrupts the blood flow to your brain for much longer. This leads to more severe damage to the brain and longer-term problems.
The blockage responsible for most TIAs is usually caused by a
blood clot
that has travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain.
A type of irregular heartbeat called
atrial fibrillation
can also cause TIAs. It can create blood clots that escape from the heart and become stuck in the blood vessels that supply the brain.
There are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or TIA:
poor diet
lack of exercise
obesity
smoking
an excessive alcohol intake
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
(hypertension)
diabetes
atrial fibrillation
Lifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication.
Taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to
atrial fibrillation
will help reduce the risk of stroke.
If you’ve had a stroke or TIA, these measures are particularly important because you’re more likely to have another stroke in future.
There are some risk factors you can’t change like:
age – people over 65 are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age – including in children
family history – if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher
ethnicity – if you’re south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups
your medical history – if you’ve had a
stroke
, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or
heart attack
, your risk of stroke is higher
Diagnosing TIAs
You should have an assessment in hospital as soon as possible if you think you’ve had a TIA.
Initial assessment
TIAs are often over very quickly, so you may not have any symptoms by the time you see a doctor.
You should tell the person assessing you about the symptoms you experienced and how long they lasted. This will help to rule out other conditions that may have caused your symptoms.
Even if you no longer have symptoms, you might still need a neurological examination. This involves simple tasks designed to check your strength, sensation and co-ordination skills.
Referral to a specialist
If a TIA is suspected, you’ll see a specialist for further tests as soon as possible.
You’ll normally take aspirin while you’re waiting for specialist assessment. This can help to reduce your risk of having a stroke or another TIA in the meantime.
It’s likely you’ll see a doctor who specialises in strokes.
Tests
You might have some tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms and to help identify the underlying cause of your TIA.
Blood tests
You might need
blood tests
to determine whether you have
high cholesterol
, and to check if you have
diabetes
.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An
electrocardiogram (ECG)
measures your heart’s electrical activity using electrodes (small, sticky patches) on your skin.
An ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions like
atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly)
.
Carotid ultrasound
A carotid
ultrasound scan
can show if there’s narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.
A small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they create an image of the inside of your body.
Brain scans
Brain scans are not always necessary if you’ve had a TIA.
You might have a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
. This scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain.
You might have a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
if an MRI scan is not suitable for you. This type of scan uses a series of X-rays to produce an image of the inside of brain.
Treating TIAs
Although the symptoms of a TIA stop on their own, you’ll need treatment to help reduce the risk of another TIA or a full
stroke
.
Appropriate treatment following a TIA can help to reduce your risk of having one.
Your doctor will tell you about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk. Your doctor will prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause of your TIA. You might need surgery as part of your treatment.
Lifestyle changes
There are lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your chances of having a stroke after a TIA like:
eating a healthy diet
– a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains
exercising regularly
– this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level
stopping smoking
if you smoke
cutting down on the amount of alcohol
you drink
Medication
Most people who’ve had a TIA will take medication to reduce their chances of having a stroke or another TIA.
After a TIA, the aim is to reduce the risk of a stroke especially in the first few days. To do this a combination of treatments is usually recommended. Some of the treatments might include:
antiplatelets like
aspirin
and
clopidogrel
anticoagulants like apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or warfarin
medication to lower your blood pressure (antihypertensives)
statins
to lower your cholesterol
The antiplatelet medications need to be taken immediately. Others may only be started later and usually need to be taken long term.
Carotid endarterectomy
A carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove part of the lining of the carotid artery and any blockage in the artery.
By unblocking the carotid arteries, a carotid endarterectomy can reduce the risk of having a stroke or another TIA."

Syphilis is a bacterial infection. It’s hard to detect and is one of the most easily caught sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Symptoms of syphilis
Most people with syphilis don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. Symptoms change over time and may come and go.
Syphilis usually has 3 stages.
The first stage (primary syphilis)
Ten days to 3 months after infection, you may notice a small, painless sore or ulcer.
This is typically on either the:
penis
vagina
anus
rectum
tongue
lips
You might only have 1 sore, but can have more.
Swelling in your lymph glands (such as in the neck, groin or armpit) often happens with the ulcers.
The sore will then disappear within 2 to 6 weeks. If left untreated, syphilis will move into its second stage.
The second stage (secondary syphilis)
Symptoms of secondary syphilis begin a few weeks after the original sore disappears.
Common symptoms of secondary syphilis include:
a non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet
tiredness
headaches
swollen lymph glands
Less common symptoms include:
fever
weight loss
patchy hair loss
joint pains
These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go for a few months.
Syphilis will then move into a stage where you will experience no symptoms. You’re still infected during this stage. This is called ‘latent syphilis’. You can still pass it on during the first year of this stage. After a couple of years, you can’t pass the infection to others, even though you remain infected. However, during this stage, the infection can be passed on from a mother to an unborn child during pregnancy.
The latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after you first become infected. Without treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the more serious stage –tertiary syphilis.
The third stage (tertiary syphilis)
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after the initial infection. 1 in 3 people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms eventually.
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. For example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms:
stroke
dementia
loss of co-ordination
numbness
paralysis
blindness
deafness
heart disease
skin rashes
At this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death.
Testing for syphilis
If you think you might have syphilis, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
What does a syphilis test involve?
The only reliable way to tell if you have syphilis or not is to have a blood test. This is usually sent to the lab for analysis. However, in some sexual health services, a same day test can be done if you have symptoms.
Treatment for syphilis
Antibiotics will treat the syphilis infection, even during pregnancy. These are given by injection, tablets or capsules.
Treatment may be started before your test result is known. You may be given one or more doses, depending on the stage of infection.
You’ll need to go back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested.
You should avoid having sex until you and your partner (s) have finished treatment and your tests have shown treatment has worked. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.
Your partner should also get tested for syphilis. It can be hard to spot in its early stages and they might not realise they have it. They will generally be offered treatment regardless.
Syphilis and pregnancy
In Scotland, pregnant women are tested for syphilis as part of their
antenatal checks
.
If you’re pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they’re born. This is known as congenital syphilis.
Having syphilis during pregnancy can increase the risk of:
miscarriage
premature birth
stillbirth
How syphilis is passed on
You can get syphilis by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Around one third of all people who get syphilis do so through having unprotected oral sex with no other vaginal or anal sex involved. It can also be passed by coming into contact with an ulcer on your partners penis, vagina, anus or inside their mouth.
Syphilis can be passed on:
to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis)
by injecting drugs with a needle that’s been used by someone who has syphilis
during a blood or organ transplant (this is extremely rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis)
Syphilis also makes
HIV
easier to pass on and catch.
The number of people getting syphilis in Scotland has greatly increased over the last 5 years. You could be at higher risk if you:
are a
man who has sex with men
have had sex overseas
have had multiple sexual partners
How to prevent syphilis
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with syphilis you should get tested for all STIs including:
HIV
chlamydia
gonorrhoea

About tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.
It is a serious condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.
TB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.
Symptoms of TB
Typical symptoms of TB include:
a persistent
cough
that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody
weight loss
night sweats
high temperature (fever)
tiredness and fatigue
loss of appetite
new swellings that haven’t gone away after a few weeks
You should see a GP if you have a cough that lasts more than three weeks or if you cough up blood.
Read more about the
symptoms of TB
and
diagnosing TB
What causes TB?
TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
TB that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it usually only spreads after prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. For example, it often spreads within a family who live in the same house.
In most healthy people, the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms.
Sometimes the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. This means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as ‘latent TB’.
If the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as ‘active TB’.
Latent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.
Read more about the
causes of TB
Who is affected?
Before antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common.
However, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common.
It’s estimated that around one-third of the world’s population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point.
How TB is treated
With treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for 6 months.
Several different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with 6 or more different medications may be needed.
If you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest
X-ray
,
blood tests
, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.
Read more about
treating TB
Tuberculosis vaccination
The
BCG vaccine
can provide effective protection against TB in up to 8 out of 10 people who are given it.
Currently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB.
This includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and people under the age of 16 who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB for more than three months.
It’s also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated because of the increased risk of contracting TB while working.
Symptoms of tuberculosis
The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs.
TB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.
In some cases the infection doesn’t cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It’s called active TB if you have symptoms. You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB.
Read about the
causes of tuberculosis
for more information about latent and active TB.
Main symptoms
General symptoms of TB include:
lack of appetite and weight loss
a high temperature (fever)
night sweats
extreme tiredness or fatigue
These symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB.
Additional symptoms
TB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.
Pulmonary TB
Most infections affect the lungs, which can cause:
a persistent
cough
that lasts more than 3 weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody
breathlessness
that gradually gets worse
This is known as pulmonary TB.
Extrapulmonary TB
Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the nervous system (brain and nerves).
This is known as extrapulmonary TB.
Symptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include:
persistently
swollen glands
abdominal (tummy) pain
pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint
confusion
a persistent
headache
seizures (fits)
Extrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with
HIV
.
Causes of tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain TB bacteria.
Although it is spread in a similar way to a
cold
or the
flu
, TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.
For example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.
Not everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection.
Latent or active TB
In most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB. However, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don’t cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active TB).
Up to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened – for example, during
chemotherapy
.
Who’s most at risk?
Anyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those:
who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB – around 3 in every 4 TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK
in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected
living in crowded conditions
with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as
HIV
having treatments that weaken the immune system, such as
corticosteroids
, chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of
arthritis
and certain gut conditions)
who are very young or very old – the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults
in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse,
alcohol misuse
, or homelessness
Diagnosing tuberculosis
Several tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected.
Your GP may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB.
Pulmonary TB
A diagnosis of pulmonary TB (TB that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed.
This will include a chest
X-ray
to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria.
These tests are important in helping to decide on the most effective treatment for you.
Extrapulmonary TB
If you have suspected extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These may include:
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
, or
ultrasound scan
of the affected part of the body
examining the inside of your body with a long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy)
urine and
blood tests
a
biopsy
– a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria
You may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
Screening for latent TB
In some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent TB (when you have been infected with TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms).
For example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active TB infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high.
If you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient.
Mantoux test
The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It’s also called the tuberculin skin test (TST).
If you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection.
If you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.
If you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB.
Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)
The IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available.
The IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB:
if you have a positive Mantoux test
if you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases)
as part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common
as part of a health check when you register with a GP
if you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system
if you are a healthcare worker
Treating tuberculosis
Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) will usually involve a long course of
antibiotics
lasting several months.
While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.
For most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.
Pulmonary TB
If you’re diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a 6-month course of a combination of antibiotics. The usual course of treatment is:
2 antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 6 months
2 additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first 2 months
It may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB.
After taking the medicine for 2 weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.
Taking medication for 6 months is the most effective method of ensuring the TB bacteria are killed. If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. This is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment.
If you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient.
If treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. However, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.
In rare cases TB can be fatal, even with treatment. Death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.
Extrapulmonary TB
Extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months.
If you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a
corticosteroid
such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas.
As with pulmonary TB, it’s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.
Latent TB
Latent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.
However, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent TB aged 35 to 65 isn’t recommended if this is a concern.
Latent TB is also not always treated if it’s thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active.
In some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids,
chemotherapy
or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active.
Treatment for latent TB generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for 3 months, or isoniazid on its own for 6 months.
Side effects of treatment
Isoniazid can cause nerve damage (
peripheral neuropathy
), but you’ll be given supplements of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. Your liver function may be tested before you start treatment.
In rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you are going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment.
Contact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as:
being sick
yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice)
an unexplained high temperature (fever)
tingling or numbness in your hands or feet
a rash or itchy skin
changes to your vision, such as blurred vision
Rifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception, such as the
combined contraceptive pill
. Use an alternative method of contraception, such as
condoms
, while taking rifampicin.
Preventing the spread of infection
If you are diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you will be contagious up to about 2 to 3 weeks into your course of treatment.
You will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it’s important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should:
stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it is safe to return
always cover your mouth – preferably with a disposable tissue – when coughing, sneezing or laughing
carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag
open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time
do not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it"

About type 2 diabetes
Diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.
The hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood
There are two main types of diabetes:
type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin
type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin
This topic is about type 2 diabetes.
Read more about type 1 diabetes
Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth.
Symptoms of diabetes
The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy.
Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine.
Typical symptoms include:
feeling very thirsty
passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
slow to heal cuts or ulcers
frequent vaginal or penile thrush
blurred vision
Read more about the
symptoms of type 2 diabetes
It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated.
Causes of type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy.
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. Due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. It’s far more common than type 1 diabetes.
Read about the
causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes
Treating type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease.
Read more about the
treatment of type 2 diabetes
Complications of type 2 diabetes
Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It’s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age.
Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes
screened
once a year for diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents.
Read more about the
complications of type 2 diabetes
Preventing type 2 diabetes
If you’re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes.
These include:
losing weight if you’re overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight
eating a
healthy, balanced diet
stopping smoking
if you smoke
drinking alcohol in moderation
taking plenty of
regular exercise
Living with type 2 diabetes
If you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. This also minimises your risk of developing complications.
Read more about
living with type 2 diabetes
Symptoms of type 2 diabetes
The symptoms of diabetes include feeling very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, and feeling tired all the time.
The symptoms occur because some or all of the glucose stays in your blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to get rid of the excess glucose in your urine.
The main symptoms of type 2 diabetes are:
urinating more often than usual, particularly at night
feeling very
thirsty
feeling very tired
unexplained weight loss
itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection)
cuts or wounds that heal slowly
blurred vision – caused by the lens of the eye becoming dry
The
signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes
are usually obvious and develop very quickly, often over a few weeks.
These signs and symptoms aren’t always as obvious, however, and it’s often diagnosed during a routine check-up.
This is because they are often mild and develop gradually over a number of years. This means you may have type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it.
Early diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on.
Hyperglycaemia
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can’t produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don’t respond properly to the insulin that is produced.
This means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia.
Hyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including:
eating too much
being unwell
ineffective diabetes medication
not taking enough medication
Hyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.
Causes of type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance).
The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. Insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s converted into energy.
In type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin.
Risk factors for type 2 diabetes
Four of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are:
age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south Asian people)
genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister
weight – being overweight or obese
ethnicity – being of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK
Age
Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older.
Maintaining a healthy weight by eating a
healthy, balanced diet
and
exercising regularly
are ways of preventing and managing diabetes.
White people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African descent have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age.
However, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition.
It’s also becoming more common for children – as young as seven in some cases – to develop type 2 diabetes, mainly due to rising obesity levels.
Genetics
Genetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition.
The closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition.
Being overweight or obese
You’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you’re overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.
Fat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body’s cardiovascular and metabolic systems.
This increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including
coronary heart disease
,
stroke
and some types of
cancer.
Measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal
obesity
, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity.
Women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more.
Asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more.
Exercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%.
Read about
measuring your waist size
Ethnicity
People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in south Asian communities than in the general UK population, and it’s three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin.
People of south Asian and African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developing
complications of type 2 diabetes
, such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population.
Other risks
Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.
This is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. Discuss your options with your GP.
Pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don’t take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include
eating healthily
,
losing weight
if you’re overweight, and taking plenty of
regular exercise
.
Women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.
Treating type 2 diabetes
Medicines for type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and usually gets worse over time. Making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term.
You may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels.
Initially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. It may also include insulin or another medication that you inject.
Metformin
Metformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. It also makes your body’s cells more responsive to insulin.
If you’re overweight, it’s also likely you’ll be prescribed metformin. Unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn’t cause additional weight gain.
However, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and
diarrhoea
, and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage.
SGLT2 inhibitors
SGLT2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. They’re particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease.
The three SGLT2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include:
dapagliflozin
canagliflozin
empagliflozin
Each medication is taken as a tablet once a day. The main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections.
If you’re unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it’s important you stop these medications. Get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing.
GLP-1 agonists
GLP-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone GLP-1 (see the section on gliptins, below).
They’re given by injection and boost your own insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (“hypos”). They’re also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease.
Sulphonylureas
Sulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that’s produced by your pancreas.
Examples include:
glibenclamide
gliclazide
glimepiride
glipizide
gliquidone
You may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can’t take metformin.
Alternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn’t control blood glucose on its own.
Sulphonylureas can increase the risk of
hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. They can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.
Pioglitazone
Pioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (TZD), which make your body’s cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood.
It’s usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. It may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema).
You shouldn’t take pioglitazone if you have
heart failure
or a high risk of bone fracture.
Gliptins (DPP-4 inhibitors)
Gliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1.
GLP-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down.
By preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don’t result in episodes of hypoglycaemia.
You may be prescribed a gliptin if you’re unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. They’re not associated with weight gain and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese.
Insulin treatment
If glucose-lowering tablets aren’t effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment.
This can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it.
Insulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently. Your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations.
Insulin injections
Insulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet.
If you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it.
They will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly.
Insulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). Most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day.
Your GP practice or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly.
You can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the Diabetes UK website.
Treatment for low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)
If you have type 2 diabetes that’s controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes of
hypoglycaemia
.
Hypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low.
Mild hypoglycaemia (a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary.
If you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets.
This should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit.
In most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. You should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes.
If blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. When your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate.
If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness.
If this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.
You may require input from a health care professional. If the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein.
Your diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.
Other treatments
If you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing
heart disease
,
stroke
, foot problems, eye and
kidney disease
is increased.
To reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including:
anti-hypertensive medicines to control
high blood pressure
a
statin
, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce
high cholesterol
low-dose aspirin to prevent a
stroke
an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease
Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. If treated early enough, it may be reversible.
Monitoring blood glucose levels
If you have type 2 diabetes, your GP or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months.
This will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working.
The HbA1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months.
HbA1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it.
A high HbA1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed.
Your diabetes care team can help you set a target HbA1c level to aim for. This will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team.
Read more about the
HbA1c test
Monitoring your own blood glucose
If you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home.
Even if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels.
Other factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.
A blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. It can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia).
If blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low.
Blood glucose meters aren’t currently available for free on the NHS but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. Ask a member of your diabetes care team if you’re unsure.
Regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible.
As your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you’re taking.
In home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood.
A millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. The measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short.
A normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person.
Your diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. It’s important to know your individual targets.
Complications of type 2 diabetes
If diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems.
High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.
Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have long-term damaging effects.
Heart disease and stroke
If you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to develop
heart disease
or have a
stroke
.
Prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis, where the blood vessels become clogged up and narrowed by fatty substances.
This may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing
angina
(a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking).
It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become blocked, leading to a
heart attack
or stroke.
Nerve damage
High blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in your nerves.
This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. It can also cause numbness, which can lead to ulceration of the feet.
Damage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the central nervous system, is known as
peripheral neuropathy
.
If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea
or
constipation
.
Diabetic retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is when the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, becomes damaged.
Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents light fully passing through to your retina. If it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision.
Annual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. If significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma.
The better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems.
Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.
If the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.
The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:
laser treatment
injections of medication into your eyes
an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes
Read about diabetic eye screening.
Kidney disease
If the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.
It’s usually associated with high blood pressure, and treating this is a key part of management.
In rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead to
kidney failure
. This can mean a kidney replacement, treatment with
dialysis
or sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary.
Foot problems
Damage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer.
About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection.
If you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have your feet examined at least once a year.
If poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist.
Sexual dysfunction
In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.
Women with diabetes may experience:
reduced sex drive (loss of libido)
less pleasure from sex
vaginal dryness
less ability to orgasm
pain during sex
If you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.
Miscarriage and stillbirth
Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of
miscarriage
and stillbirth.
If your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect.
Pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their
antenatal check-ups
in hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician).
This will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby.
The
Diabetes UK
website has more information about
diabetes complications
.
Looking after your eyes
The
NHS diabetic eye screening programme
will arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year.
Everyone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. Speak to your GP to register.
Living with type 2 diabetes
Look after your feet
If you have diabetes, you’re at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes.
This is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves.
To prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water.
Wear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early.
Regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged.
See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days.
Regular eye tests
If you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged.
It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). Left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss.
Read more about
diabetic eye screening
People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can’t be relied upon for other conditions.
Pregnancy
If you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.
If you’re taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. It’s important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team.
Planning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant.
You’ll need to tightly control your blood glucose level – particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby’s development – to reduce the risk of birth defects.
You should also:
check your medications – some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications
take a higher dose of folic acid tablets – folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it’s recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin D
have your eyes checked – retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant
Your GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.
Diabetes education
You’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed and on an ongoing basis.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.
Structured patient education
Structured patient education means there’s a planned course that:
covers all aspects of diabetes
is flexible in content
is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs
is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background
For type 2 diabetes, there are several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education.
Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.
Talk to others
Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes.
Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the condition. To
find your local diabetes support group
, visit
Diabetes UK
.
If you want to get in touch with a trained counsellor directly, you can call the Diabetes UK Helpline on 0345 123 2399 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm) or email
helpline@diabetes.org.uk
Financial support and benefits
Some people with diabetes may be eligible for disability and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their lives.
The main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, the elderly, and those with learning disabilities, mental health difficulties or diabetes complications.
People over the age of 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a type of disability benefit called Attendance Allowance.
Carers may also be entitled to some benefits, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.
Citizens Advice Scotland
can check whether you’re getting all the benefits you’re entitled to. Your diabetes specialist nurse and Citizens Advice can also provide advice about filling in the forms.
Driving with diabetes
It’s a common myth that people with diabetes aren’t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think.
You should always tell your insurer that you have diabetes as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.
Additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the
DVLA guidelines
.
Unfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos.
If you start to have a hypo whilst driving you should:
Pull over safely
Switch off your car engine
Take fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers
Don’t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or above
For more information about driving with diabetes, visit Diabetes UK.
Diabetes sick day rules
If you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”.
Contact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven’t received these.
The advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:
keep taking your insulin – it’s very important not to stop treatment when you’re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose
test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day
keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks
keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier
check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high
Seek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:
you’re not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment
you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis
you have any other concerns

About type 1 diabetes
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.
The hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.
There are two main types of diabetes:
Type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin
Type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin
This topic is about type 1 diabetes.
Read more about
type 2 diabetes
Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.
It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.
You should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).
Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1.
In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all.
If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body’s organs.
Diabetes symptoms
The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn’t used by your muscles as fuel for energy.
When blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated.
Typical symptoms include:
feeling very
thirsty
passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired all the time
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
persistent infections such as thrush
The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks).

symptoms of type 1 diabetes
Causes of type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.
Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely
dehydrated
.
This results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.

causes of type 1 diabetes
Treating type 1 diabetes
It’s important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It’s essential that treatment is started early.
Diabetes can’t be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.
If you’re diagnosed with diabetes, you’ll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.
As your body can’t produce insulin, you’ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You’ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.
Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You’ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.
Insulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid) acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that’s inserted under the skin with a needle.
There are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they’re only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:
islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes
a complete pancreas transplant – this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.

Complications
If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.
Having a consistently raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.
There is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. Your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly.
Read more about the
complications of type 1 diabetes
Living with diabetes
If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications.
For example, eating a
healthy, balanced diet
and
exercising regularly
will lower your blood glucose level.
Stopping smoking
(if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing
cardiovascular disease
.
Your healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through
My Diabetes My Way
. It’s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year.
Read more about
living with type 1 diabetes
Symptoms of type 1 diabetes
The symptoms of type 1 diabetes should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.
The main symptoms of diabetes are:
feeling very
thirsty
urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection)
blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape
Vomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.
When to seek urgent medical attention
You should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop:
a loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
a high temperature
stomach pain
fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves)
Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
If you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as
hypoglycaemia
(or a “hypo”).
In most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol on an empty stomach.
Symptoms of a “hypo” include:
feeling shaky and irritable
sweating
tingling lips
feeling weak
feeling confused
hunger
nausea (feeling sick)
A hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.
If it isn’t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.
In this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. Glucagon increases the glucose in your blood. Your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.
Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)
As diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.
If your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. They include:
extreme thirst
a dry mouth
blurred vision
drowsiness
a need to pass urine frequently
Left untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.
Your healthcare team will teach you about looking out for these symptoms and how to manage your
‘Sick Day’ rules
.
The Diabetes UK website has more information about
type 1 diabetes symptoms

Causes of type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that’s needed to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood.
When you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients – including glucose – into your bloodstream.
The pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it’s converted to energy.
However, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can’t be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.
Autoimmune condition
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.
It’s not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection.
Type 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.
If you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don’t have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%.

diagnosing type 1 diabetes
Diagnosing type 1 diabetes
If you experience the
symptoms of diabetes
, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. They’ll ask about your symptoms and may request a urine and blood test.
Urine and blood tests
Your urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn’t usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes.
The GP may do a finger prick blood test for glucose and ketones. A sample will be sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. These results will be discussed with the specialist diabetes service if there is concern you have Type 1 Diabetes.
Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control.
In people who’ve already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled.
The HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you’re taking to control your diabetes are working.
If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it’s recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if:
you’ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes
your blood glucose remains too high
your treatment plan has been changed
you’re planning a pregnancy
Unlike other tests, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn’t require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it’s less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy.
The advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes.

Treating type 1 diabetes
Monitoring blood glucose
An important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible.
You’ll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a
healthy, balanced diet
, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they’re not too high or too low.
Exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels.
In most cases, you’ll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. You may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you’re taking. There are different methods of checking your blood glucose that doesn’t involve pricking your finger. Discuss your options with your diabetes care team.
The normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it’s a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood.
There is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. This is called a
flash glucose monitor
(Freestyle Libre).
The Diabetes UK website has more information on
testing your glucose levels
.
Having your blood glucose levels checked
You’ll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels.
Your GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test.
This gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks.
It measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. A high HbA1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered.
The ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol.
Treating hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
Hypoglycaemia
can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It’s likely that you’ll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time.
Mild hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as:
200ml pure fruit juice
5 to 7 Dextrose tablets
4 to 5 Glucotabs
60ml Glucojuice
5 jelly babies
You may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly.
If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you’ll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.
Your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it.
Once you begin to come round, you’ll need to eat something sugary when you’re alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there’s a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. You’ll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body.
If the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn’t work, and you’re still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you’ll need urgent medical attention.
You’ll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional.
If you have type 1 diabetes, it’s recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic.
If significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using a
continuous glucose monitor (CGM)
.
Islet cell transplantation
Some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes.
In 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below).
You may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you’ve had:
two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia
a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment
You may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you:
weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb)
have poor kidney function
need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person
An islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that’s carried out under local anaesthetic.
The procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.
Pancreas transplant
People with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time.
Others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they’ve had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets.
If you’re having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended.
During the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you to get a new source of insulin.
Pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there’s a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.
The waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there’s a shortage of suitable donor organs.
Treating high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia)
Hyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin.
If you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.
If hyperglycaemia isn’t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.
The signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:
frequently passing urine
thirst
tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy)
blurry vision
abdominal (stomach) pain
nausea and vomiting
deep breathing
smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops)
collapse and unconsciousness
Read more about the
symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis
Your healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you’re unwell.
If you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you’ll need urgent hospital treatment. You’ll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). You may also need other fluids given by a drip if you’re dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.
Other treatments
Type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing
heart disease
,
stroke
, eye and
kidney disease
. To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take:
anti-hypertensive medicines to control
high blood pressure
a statin – such as simvastatin – to reduce
high cholesterol levels
low-dose aspirin
to prevent stroke
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease
Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It’s often reversible if treated early enough.
Care standards for diabetes
The aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications.
In Scotland there is a
National Diabetes Improvement Plan
produced by the Scottish Diabetes Group, patients and health care professionals.
The
Diabetes National Service Framework
has also been developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes:
access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme
an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle – including a named contact for their care
information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications
access to services to identify and treat possible complications – such as screening for
diabetic retinopathy
(where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care
effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason
Complications of type 1 diabetes
If diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.
A consistently raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.
Heart disease and stroke
If you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to develop
heart disease
or have a
stroke
.
Prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing
atherosclerosis
(furring and narrowing of your blood vessels).
This may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing
angina
(a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a
heart attack
or stroke.
Nerve damage
High blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea
or
constipation
.
Retinopathy
Retinopathy is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. If it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision.
The better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. Having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated.
Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.
If the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.
The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:
laser treatment
injections of medication into your eyes
an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes
Read about diabetic eye screening
Kidney disease
If the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.
In rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure and the need for
dialysis
(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.
Foot problems
Damage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection.
If you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have a foot examination at least once a year.
Sexual dysfunction
In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.
Women with diabetes may experience:
a reduced sex drive (loss of libido)
reduced pleasure from sex
vaginal dryness
a reduced ability to orgasm
pain during sex
If you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.
Miscarriage and stillbirth
Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of
miscarriage
and stillbirth. If your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect.
Pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. This allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood glucose levels and control their insulin dosage more easily.

Living with type 1 diabetes
Look after your feet
Having diabetes means that you’re more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet.
To prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early.
Regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days.
The Diabetes UK website has more information and advice about
taking care of your feet
.
Regular eye tests
If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.
Retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). If it isn’t treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss.

diabetic eye screening
Diabetes sick day rules
If you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”.
Contact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven’t received these.
The advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:
keep taking your insulin – it’s very important
not
to stop treatment when you’re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose
test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day
keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks
keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier
check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high
Seek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:
you’re not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment
you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis
you have any other concerns
Pregnancy
If you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.
A planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant. Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby.
You’ll need to keep your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects.
You should also take a higher dose of folic acid tablets. Folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. Doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. Women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they’re 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription).
Folic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that include
vitamin D
. Insulin and metformin are safe to take during pregnancy. It’s important to review any other medications you take to ensure these are safe to take during pregnancy.
You should also have your eyes checked. Retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. Pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant.
Your GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.
Diabetes UK
and
JDRF
also provide more useful information about
pregnancy and diabetes
to help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start.
Education
You’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis.
The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.
This gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. It also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).
Structured patient education
Structured patient education means there’s a planned course that:
covers all aspects of diabetes
is flexible in content
is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs
is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background
There are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.
Diabetes and your child
For a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher.
Although being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will involve coming to terms with the diagnosis, getting used to treatment and making changes to everyday life, your child can still lead a normal and healthy life.
The
Diabetes UK
website has information and advice about
your child and diabetes
.
Help and support
Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who’ve been diagnosed with the condition.
The Diabetes UK website enables you to
find your local diabetes support group
. If you want to contact a trained counsellor directly, you can phone Diabetes UK’s care line on 0345 123 2399, or email
helpline.scotland@diabetes.org.uk
Further information on Helpline Scotland
Financial support and benefits
Some people with diabetes may be eligible to receive disability benefits and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their life.
The main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, elderly people, people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, and those with
complications of diabetes
.
People over 65 who are severely disabled, may qualify for a type of disability benefit called
Attendance Allowance.
Carers may also be entitled to some benefit too, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.
Staff at your local
Citizen’s Advice Scotland
can check whether you’re getting all of the benefits you’re entitled to. Both they and your diabetes specialist nurse should also be able to give you advice about filling in the forms.
Driving with diabetes
It’s a common myth that people with diabetes aren’t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think.
You should always tell your insurer that you are diabetic as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.
Additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the
DVLA guidelines
.
Unfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos or being unable to recognise symptoms of a hypo (hypo unawareness).
To prevent hypos whilst driving you should
check your blood glucose levels before driving
keep medication close by in the car
take regular breaks on long journeys over 2 hours
avoid missing meals

Trichomonas is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a small parasite.
It infects the genitals and may lead to an infection in the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and the prostate.
Symptoms of trichomonas
Most people with trichomonas infection will have no symptoms but they can still pass the infection on.
If you do develop symptoms you may get:
a yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis, which can sometimes have an unpleasant smell
genital itching and soreness
pain or a burning sensation when peeing
Some women may get some pain or discomfort during sex.
Testing for trichomonas
If you think you might have trichomonas, get tested for free by:
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
What does a trichomonas test involve?
Testing is quick and straightforward. There are 2 main ways the sample can be collected:
using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina or penis
urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed
Most sexual health clinics can look at the sample straightaway under the microscope and see the parasite. In some clinics and at your GP, the swab needs to be sent away to a lab to make the diagnosis.
The test is more accurate from vagina samples. It’s less accurate from penis and urine samples.
Treating trichomonas
Trichomonas infection is treated with antibiotics.
It’s advised that both you and your partner(s) are treated if you have the infection.
You and your partner(s) may be asked to return to your GP practice or sexual health clinic for another test to check the infection has gone.
You should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) treatment has finished.
If your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
How trichomonas is passed on
Trichomonas infection is spread through unprotected sex and sharing sex toys.
It’s not passed on through oral or anal sex.
You can’t pass on trichomonas through:
kissing or hugging
sharing cups, plates or cutlery
toilet seats
How to prevent trichomonas
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice
safer sex
. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
Other STIs
If you have been diagnosed with trichomonas, you should get tested for all STIs including:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea

Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition where your large bowel (colon and rectum) gets swollen and inflamed.
Your colon is your large intestine (bowel). Your rectum is the end of your bowel, where poo is stored.
If you have ulcerative colitis, you get swelling, inflammation and ulcers in the lining of your large bowel. They can bleed and produce pus.
Ulcerative colitis can affect people of all ages, but it’s usually diagnosed between the age of 15 and 40.
Symptoms
The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:
recurring
diarrhoea
, which may contain blood, mucus or pus
abdominal pain
needing to poo often
You may also experience:
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
loss of appetite
weight loss
Some people also get symptoms in other parts of their body. For example, some people develop:
painful and swollen joints (
arthritis
)
mouth ulcers
areas of painful, red and swollen skin
irritated and red eyes
Speak to your GP practice if:
you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you haven’t been diagnosed with the condition
Symptoms of a flare-up
Some people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.
Symptoms of flare-ups vary from person-to-person. They may include:
diarrhoea 6 or more times a day
blood or mucus in your poo
severe abdominal pain
symptoms in other parts of your body
Severe ulcerative colitis can also cause symptoms like:
shortness of breath
a fast or irregular heartbeat
a high temperature (fever)
blood in your poo becoming more obvious
Speak to your inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) team if:
you have ulcerative colitis and think you’re having a flare-up
Causes
The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.
A combination of factors may be responsible, including:
problems with your immune system – where the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your large bowel, making it inflamed
genetics – genes you inherit from your family
environmental factors – like air pollution, medication and viruses or bacteria in your gut
Diagnosis
To help diagnose ulcerative colitis, your GP will ask about your:
your pattern of symptoms
your diet
any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers’ diarrhoea
whether you’re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines
whether anyone else in your family has a bowel condition
any health problems you’ve had in the past
Your GP may also:
examine your abdomen (tummy)
ask for a stool (poo) sample and use a qFIT test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin test
arrange
blood tests
to check for inflammation or
anaemia
Additional tests for ulcerative colitis
If your GP thinks that you have ulcerative colitis you may be referred to hospital for more tests. These could include:
colonoscopy
– a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel
sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel
X-ray
MRI scan
or
computerised tomography (CT)
You will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.
Treatment
Treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve and prevent symptoms.
Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and how often they flare up. Mild flare-ups can be usually be treated at home. But severe flare-ups usually need treatment in hospital to reduce the risk of complications.
Treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.
Medication
Most people will get medication to treat symptoms of ulcerative colitis. This includes medications like:
aminosalicylates (ASAs) – often the first treatment option, used to get and keep inflammation under control and can be given rectally as well as orally
corticosteroids
– used to get inflammation under control quickly, but not suitable for long-term use
If you have lots of flare-ups or aminosalicylates do not keep your inflammation under control, you may need other treatments, such as:
immunosuppressants like azathioprine or mercaptopurine – used to reduce the activity of the immune system
biologic medicines, like adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab
other advanced medicines like filgotinib, ozanimod, tofacitinib and upadacitinib
Surgery
Surgery to treat ulcerative colitis may be an option if:
you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects
medications don’t control your symptoms
your quality of life is severely affected by your condition
you have serious complications of ulcerative colitis
Surgery for ulcerative colitis involves removing part or all of your large bowel (known as a colectomy). This means the small intestine must be used to pass waste products out of your body instead.
During the surgery, your small intestine will either be:
joined to the surface of your tummy (known as an
ileostomy
or a colostomy) – after this type of surgery, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear
joined directly to your rectum (the end of your large bowel), so your poo comes out of your bottom as usual
used to create an internal pouch that’s connected to your bottom (known as an ileo-anal pouch or J-pouch) – this means your poo can pass through your bottom as usual
Diet
There’s no evidence that a particular diet causes ulcerative colitis. But alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people.
You could:
eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals
try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains
drink plenty of water
You could also speak to your IBD team about:
keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms
removing trigger foods from your diet – but do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need
taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet
being referred to a dietitian
Managing stress
Stress doesn’t cause ulcerative colitis. But, managing stress may reduce how often you get symptoms.
To help manage stress, you could:
exercise
– speak to your IBD team about a suitable exercise plan
try relaxation techniques like yoga, medication and breathing exercises
talk to others – Crohn’s & Colitis UK has details of
local support groups
speak to your GP if you think you may have
depression
Fertility and pregnancy
A woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by ulcerative colitis.
However, surgery for ulcerative colitis might affect your fertility, especially pouch surgery.
Most women with ulcerative colitis will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. But if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your IBD team. This is because they may need to change your medication.
If you’re having a flare-up of ulcerative colitis you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control.
Complications
If you have ulcerative colitis, you may be at an increased risk of developing other problems. This can include:
osteoporosis
poor growth and development in children and young people
More serious and rare complications can include:
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) – inflammation in the bile ducts, which can lead to liver damage
narrowing’s in the bowel (strictures) that may become blocked or make it difficult for poo to pass through
toxic megacolon – severe inflammation in the colon may lead to trapped gas so the colon becomes very enlarged and can rupture
a higher risk of getting
bowel cancer
a higher risk of getting blood clots in your legs or lungs"

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections that affect the bladder, the kidneys and the tubes connected to them.
Anyone can get them, but they’re particularly common in women. Some women experience them regularly (called recurrent UTIs).
UTIs can be painful and uncomfortable, but usually pass within a few days and can be treated with
antibiotics
.
This page is about UTIs in adults. There is a separate page about
UTIs in children
.
Urinary infection self-help guide
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Symptoms of UTIs
Lower UTIs
Infections of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra (tube that carries urine out of the body) are known as lower UTIs. These can cause:
a need to pee more often than usual
pain or discomfort when peeing
sudden urges to pee
feeling as though you’re unable to empty your bladder fully
pain low down in your tummy
urine that’s cloudy, foul-smelling or contains blood
feeling generally unwell, achy and tired
You can speak to your pharmacist for advice and treatment on lower UTIs.
Lower UTIs are common and aren’t usually a cause for major concern.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Upper UTIs
Infections of the kidneys
or ureters (tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder) are known as upper UTIs. These can cause the same symptoms as lower UTIs and also:
a high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above
pain in your sides or back
shivering and chills
feeling and being sick
confusion
agitation or restlessness
Upper UTIs can be serious if left untreated, as they could damage the kidneys or spread to the bloodstream.
Speak to your GP urgently if:
You think you, your child or someone you care for may have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and:
have a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery
have a low temperature below 36°C
are confused or drowsy
have pain in the lower tummy or in the back, just under the ribs
can see blood in your pee
If your GP is closed, phone 111.
These symptoms could mean you have a
kidney infection
, which can be serious if it’s not treated as it could cause
sepsis
.
Speak to your GP if:
you have symptoms of an upper UTI
your child has symptoms of a UTI
the symptoms are severe or getting worse
the symptoms haven’t started to improve after a few days
you get UTIs frequently
your symptoms come back after treatment
Your GP team can:
rule out other possible causes of your symptoms by testing a sample of your urine
prescribe antibiotics if you have an infection
Treatment for UTIs
UTIs are normally treated with a short term course of antibiotics.
Most women are given a 3-day course of antibiotic capsules or tablets. Men, pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course.
Your symptoms will normally pass within 3 to 5 days of starting treatment. Make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you’ve been prescribed, even if you’re feeling better.
Over-the-counter pain relief such as
paracetamol
can help with any pain. Drinking plenty of fluids may also help you feel better.
Return to your GP if your symptoms don’t improve, get worse, or come back after treatment.
Causes of UTIs
UTIs occur when the urinary tract becomes infected, usually by bacteria. In most cases, bacteria from the gut enter the urinary tract through the urethra.
This may happen when wiping your bottom or having sex. But often it’s not clear why it happens.
The following may increase your risk of getting a UTI:
conditions that obstruct your urinary tract, such as
kidney stones
difficulty emptying your bladder fully
using a
contraceptive diaphragm
or
condoms
coated in spermicide
diabetes
a weak immune system – for example from
chemotherapy
or
HIV
a urinary catheter (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
an
enlarged prostate gland
in men
Women may be more likely to get UTIs because their urethra is shorter than a man’s and is closer to their anus (back passage).
Preventing UTIs
There are some things you can do to try to prevent UTIs.
Do
go to the toilet as soon as you need to pee
always empty your bladder fully
stay well hydrated
wipe your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet
pee as soon as possible after having sex
have a shower rather than a bath
wear underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon
avoid tight jeans and trousers
Don’t
do not use perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals – use plain, unperfumed ones instead
do not use a diaphragm or condoms with spermicidal lubricant on them – try another type of contraception
Speak to your GP if these measures don’t work.
Drinking cranberry juice or using probiotics aren’t proven to reduce your chances of getting UTIs."

About vaginal cancer
Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the vagina.
Cancer that begins in the vagina is called primary vaginal cancer. Cancer that begins in another part of the body – such as the cervix, womb or ovaries – and spreads to the vagina is known as secondary vaginal cancer.
This topic is about primary vaginal cancer. There are separate topics on
cervical cancer
,
ovarian cancer
and
womb cancer
.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom of vaginal cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This includes:
bleeding between your normal periods, or after sex
bleeding after the
menopause
(post-menopausal bleeding)
Other symptoms can include:
smelly or bloody vaginal discharge
pain during sex
pain when urinating
needing to urinate more frequently than usual
blood in your urine
pelvic pain
an itch or lump in your vagina
Speak to your GP if you experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding, changes in your usual pattern of periods (such as irregular periods or heavier periods than usual), or problems urinating.
While it’s highly unlikely that these symptoms are caused by vaginal cancer, they should still be investigated by your GP.
Read more about diagnosing vaginal cancer.
What causes vaginal cancer?
The exact causes of vaginal cancer are unknown, but things that may increase your risk of developing it include:
being infected with a particularly persistent type of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be spread during sex
your age – 7 out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer affect women and anyone with a vagina over 60
a previous history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) – abnormal cells in the vagina or cervix that can sometimes become cancerous
As there is a possible link with HPV, it may be possible to reduce your risk of vaginal cancer by practising safe sex.
The
HPV vaccination
, which is routinely offered to girls who are 12 to 13 years old, provides protection against 2 strains of HPV thought to be responsible for most cases of vaginal and cervical cancer.
Read more about the
causes of vaginal cancer
.
How vaginal cancer is treated
Treatment for vaginal cancer depends on which part of your vagina is affected and how far the cancer has spread (known as the ‘stage’).
The main treatments for vaginal cancer are:
radiotherapy
– radiation is used to destroy the cancerous cells
surgery to remove the cancerous cells
chemotherapy
– medication is used to kill the cancerous cells; this is often used in combination with radiotherapy
These treatments can cause both short- and long-term side effects that should be discussed with your care team before treatment begins.

Causes of vaginal cancer
Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
The exact reason why this happens in cases of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.
There are many different types of HPV and up to 8 out of every 10 people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to vaginal cancer.
However, HPV is present in more than two-thirds of people with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition.
HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to
cervical cancer
. It’s thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina.
Abnormal cells in the cervix or vagina
You’re more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you’ve previously been found to have abnormal cells in your:
cervix – known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
vagina – known as vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)
CIN and VAIN are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. Both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent HPV infection.
The abnormal cells don’t usually cause any problems themselves and may only be detected during
cervical screening
, but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous.
If you’re found to have CIN or VAIN, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended.
Diethylstilbestrol
A medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. The medication was widely prescribed during pregnancy between 1938 and 1971, because it was thought it could help reduce the risk of
miscarriage
.
However, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine. The use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnant was then banned.
The risk of vaginal cancer associated with diethylstilbestrol is small and as it’s now over 40 years since it was last used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare.
Other possible factors
Other things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include:
your age – 7 out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women and anyone with a vagina over 60
having a history of reproductive cancers, such as
cervical cancer
or
vulval cancer
– particularly if you were treated with
radiotherapy
smoking
having
HIV

Cancer Research UK: risks and causes of vaginal cancer
Diagnosing vaginal cancer
To help diagnose vaginal cancer, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and may carry out a physical examination.
They may also refer you for
blood tests
to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection.
If your GP cannot find an obvious cause of your symptoms, they will probably refer you to a gynaecologist for further testing. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.
If your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2 weeks.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina.
Seeing a gynaecologist
If you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have:
external and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings
a
colposcopy
– an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detail
If your gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. This is known as a
biopsy
.
If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread.
These tests may include a more detailed internal vaginal examination carried out under
general anaesthetic
,
X-rays
,
computerised tomography (CT) scans
and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
.
Staging
Healthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced.
stage 1 – the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina
stage 2 – the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues
stage 3 – the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes
stage 4a – the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum)
stage 4b – the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungs
The stage of your cancer is important in determining which treatment is most appropriate and whether a cure is possible. Generally, the lower the stage when cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of a cure.
If a cure is not possible, treatment can still help relieve any symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. Read more about
how vaginal cancer is treated
.
Read further information:
Cancer Research UK: tests for vaginal cancer
Cancer Research UK: stages of vaginal cancer
Treating vaginal cancer
Treatment for vaginal cancer will depend on where the cancer is in your vagina and how far it has spread. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.
When you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Your MDT will include a range of specialists, including surgeons, clinical oncologists (specialists in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and specialist cancer nurses.
Your MDT will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, but the final decision will be yours.
Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
is the main treatment for vaginal cancer. It can be used:
as an initial treatment to cure the cancer
in combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation)
after surgery to prevent the cancer from returning
to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)
How it’s carried out
There are 2 main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given:
external radiotherapy – a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis
internal radiotherapy – a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vagina
The type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. For example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. You can receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy.
External radiotherapy is usually given for around 4 to 6 weeks in short daily sessions, from Monday to Friday. You return home between treatments and have a break at the weekends.
Internal radiotherapy may involve either a long treatment session where you need to stay in hospital for 24 hours, or several short day-case treatments.
Read more about
how radiotherapy is performed
.
Side effects
Following radiotherapy, it’s likely you will have some side effects. These occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones.
Possible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include:
sore, red skin – similar to
sunburn
vaginal discharge
pain while passing urine
diarrhoea
tiredness
feeling sick
narrowing of the vagina (see below)
early menopause and infertility (see below)
Read more about the
side effects of radiotherapy
.
Effects on sex
Radiotherapy may cause you to lose interest in sex, particularly if you have side effects such as tiredness or nausea, or you are anxious about your condition or treatment.
Radiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable.
If you feel up to it, your care team may suggest having sex regularly during treatment to help stop this happening. Devices called dilators, which are inserted into the vagina, can also be used after treatment stops to help stop your vagina getting narrower.
You may also experience some vaginal dryness or pain when having sex. If this happens, you can try using lubricants or asking your care team about possible treatments.
Menopause and fertility
If you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an early
menopause
(if you have not had the menopause already).
This means you will no longer be able to have children (infertility). Before your treatment, your care team will explain whether this is a risk and discuss the options and support available.
Surgery
There are 4 main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer:
partial vaginectomy – removing the upper section of your vagina
radical vaginectomy – removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes
radical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy – removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes
pelvic exenteration – removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage)
Partial vaginectomy
A partial vaginectomy can be used to treat stage 1 vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children.
Your surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread.
Your surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation.
Radical vaginectomy
A radical vaginectomy may be used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. The surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina.
A plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body – usually one of your thighs or buttocks.
You will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make.
Radical hysterectomy
A radical hysterectomy is often performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy.
During a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes.
Pelvic exenteration
Pelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer.
If you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. One solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. A bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. The bag is known as a urostomy bag.
Similarly, as you may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. Another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag.
Read more about
colostomies
.
A vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after a pelvic exenteration. It may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. In this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy.
As pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy). It’s usually given by injection (intravenous chemotherapy).
Like radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include:
tiredness
feeling sick
increased risk of infections
diarrhoea
hair loss
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
Coping with treatment
Treatment for vaginal cancer can have a significant emotional impact, particularly for young women who experience an early menopause as a result of treatment.
The removal of some or all of the vagina can be traumatic for pre- and post-menopausal women alike, and some women feel less ‘womanly’ than they did before. It’s not uncommon to feel a sense of loss and bereavement after treatment. In some women, this may lead to
depression
.
You may find it helpful to talk to other women who have had similar treatment. Your GP or hospital staff may be able to recommend a suitable local support group. Charities can also help:
Macmillan Cancer Support
has information on
groups you can join
and a support line that you can call for free on 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm)
Cancer Research UK
provides a free phone number that you can call on 0808 800 40 40 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm)
If feelings of depression persist, speak to your GP about the treatment and support available.
Clinical trials
As vaginal cancer is rare, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial. Clinical trials are an important way for healthcare professionals to learn more about the best way to treat specific conditions.
Most clinical trials involve comparing a new treatment with an existing treatment to determine whether the new treatment is more or less effective. If you do receive a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing one.
You can find out whether there are currently any clinical trials for vaginal cancer, or ask your care team if there are clinical trials in your area. Your care team can explain the advantages and disadvantages of taking part.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/transverse-myelitis/,"Transverse myelitis
Transverse myelitis is a rare neurological condition. It’s caused by inflammation (swelling) of the spinal cord. The swelling damages the nerves and can leave permanent scars or lesions.
The scars or lesions interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body.
‘Transverse’ refers to the swelling being across the width of the spinal cord. It’s also sometimes used to describe swelling that only affects part of the width of the spinal cord.
Symptoms of transverse myelitis
The symptoms of transverse myelitis can include:
muscle weakness in the legs, and sometimes the arms
mobility problems
unusual sensations and numbness
bladder problems
bowel problems
sexual problems
pain
Transverse myelitis can happen to anyone at any time in their life. In most cases there might only be one episode of symptoms, but sometimes it can happen repeatedly. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS or another condition.
Causes of transverse myelitis
There are several different causes of transverse myelitis. Sometimes a cause isn’t found, and this is called idiopathic transverse myelitis.
Autoimmune disease
Sometimes transverse myelitis is caused by an autoimmune reaction. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakes the body’s own tissue as dangerous and attacks it. This causes swelling that results in damage to the myelin sheath. This includes:
MS-like swelling
neuromyelitis optica (NMO)
myelin oligodendrocyte antibody (MOG) associated myelitis
sarcoidosis
Sjögrens syndrome
lupus
Viral infection
Sometimes transverse myelitis is caused indirectly by a viral infection, although often the virus responsible isn’t identified.
Transverse myelitis often develops after a viral infection like:
echovirus
enterovirus
Epstien-Barr
hepatitis A
herpes simplex
HIV
rubella
influenza (flu)
varicella zoster (the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles)
Bacterial infection
Bacterial infections such as
syphilis
might also lead to transverse myelitis.
Cancer
Some cancers might trigger an unusual immune response that can lead to transverse myelitis.
Diagnosing transverse myelitis
If your GP thinks you could have transverse myelitis, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.
Some of the tests you may need to confirm transverse myelitis are:
neurological examination
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
lumbar puncture
blood test
s
Sometimes your neurologist will do other tests to look for conditions that cause transverse myelitis. This might include
CT scans
.
Treating transverse myelitis
Sometimes transverse myelitis requires no treatment as it will improve on its own. Sometimes patients may require treatment for their symptoms, the swelling, or the underlying cause.
Treatment for transverse myelitis symptoms
There are different treatments available for transverse myelitis symptoms.
Muscle weakness
Physiotherapy can help improve strength, and the muscle spasms and stiffness that may sometimes develop.
Techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.
If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.
These medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your healthcare professional.
Mobility problems
Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance can also cause mobility problems.
If you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest:
an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist
mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair
home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings
An
occupational therapist
can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.
Treatment of the inflammation (swelling)
Sometimes your neurologist might offer treatment with steroids. This can help with some types of transverse myelitis. Steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible
steroid side effects
. The side effects could include reflux and stomach irritation, worsening infection, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping.
Bladder problems
Medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.
If you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.
Sometimes a
catheter
can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC).
In rare cases, people with transverse myelitis may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.
You might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. Read more about
treating urinary incontinence
.
Bowel problems
It might be possible to treat mild to moderate
constipation
by changing your diet or taking
laxatives
.
More severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools.
Anti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence.
Sexual problems
If you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help.
If you have transverse myelitis and find it hard to get or maintain an erection (
erectile dysfunction
) you may be prescribed medication to increase the blood flow to the penis.
Musculoskeletal pain
A physiotherapist might be able to help with this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions.
If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves.
Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation.
This type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers.
Other treatments for transverse myelitis
You may be offered other treatments depending on the cause of your transverse myelitis. Your neurologist will discuss your options with you."

The main symptom of hives (urticaria) is a rash.
The rash may:
be raised
be very itchy
be on one part of the body
spread over large areas
range is size from a few millimetres to the size of a hand
change in appearance within 24 hours
The image shows a hives rash on the side of the stomach. The rash is small, circular patches of pink on pale skin.

Diagnosing hives
Hives can usually be diagnosed by examining the distinctive red rash. The pharmacist or GP may also ask you questions to find out what triggered your symptoms.
If your symptoms last a while (chronic urticaria), a doctor may arrange for tests to help work out the cause. They’ll also ask about anything that makes your symptoms worse.
Treating hives
Most hives rashes don’t need treatment. The symptoms are usually mild and often get better within a few days.
If necessary, a pharmacist can give you advice about antihistamines to help treat hives.
Antihistamines may not be suitable for young children or if you’ve got a long term condition. You should discuss this with the pharmacist.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Treating severe hives
If hives are more severe, your doctor may prescribe:
steroid tablets (
oral corticosteroids
)
antihistamines
menthol cream to relieve itchiness
If hives don’t go away with treatment, a doctor may also refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).
Phone 999 or go to A&E if you:
have swelling in your mouth, eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, feet or hands
are wheezing
feel lightheaded or faint
get tightness in your chest or throat
have trouble breathing or talking
have abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
You could be having a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and may need immediate treatment in hospital.
Speak to a GP if:
the symptoms don’t improve after 2 days
you’re worried about your child’s hives
the rash is spreading
the symptoms are severe
hives keeps coming back (you may be allergic to something)
you also have a high temperature and feel unwell
you also have swelling under your skin (this might be angioedema)
the symptoms cause distress
the symptoms disrupt daily activities
Causes of hives
Hives occur when histamine and other chemicals are released from under the skin’s surface. This causes the tissues to swell.
Histamine can be released for many reasons, including:
eating certain foods
an insect bite or sting
cold – including exposure to cold water or wind
heat – including from exercise or eating spicy food
emotional stress
an infecti
o
n like a cold
having drinks like alcohol or caffeine
taking medicines like
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
or
antibiotics
a reaction to environmental factors like pollen, dust mites or chemicals
an allergic reaction to latex
scratching or pressing on your skin – like wearing itchy or tight clothing
a problem with your immune system
water or sunlight (though this is rare)
If you can, try to work out what’s causing your hives. This can help to avoid them in the future.

About underactive thyroids
An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones.
Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.
An underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making.
There’s no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. Most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage to the thyroid that occurs during some treatments for an overactive thyroid or
thyroid cancer
.
Read more about the
causes of an underactive thyroid
When to see your GP
Symptoms of an underactive thyroid
are often similar to those of other conditions, and they usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years.
You should see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have symptoms including:
tiredness
weight gain
depression
being sensitive to the cold
dry skin and hair
muscle aches
The only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have a thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your hormone levels.
Read more about
testing for an underactive thyroid
Who’s affected
Both men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although it’s more common in women. In the UK, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and 1 in 1,000 men. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid.
Around 1 in 3,500 to 4,000 babies are born with an underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism using a
blood spot test
when the baby is about 5 days old.
Treating an underactive thyroid
Treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine, to raise your thyroxine levels. You’ll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.
If an underactive thyroid isn’t treated, it can lead to complications, including
heart disease
, goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare).
Read more about
treating an underactive thyroid
and the
complications of an underactive thyroid
Symptoms of an underactive thyroid
Many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.
Symptoms usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.
Common symptoms include:
tiredness
being sensitive to cold
weight gain
constipation
depression
slow movements and thoughts
muscle aches and weakness
muscle cramps
dry and scaly skin
brittle hair and nails
loss of libido (sex drive)
pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)
irregular periods or heavy periods
Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.
If you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.
Read more about
getting tested for an underactive thyroid
If an underactive thyroid isn’t treated
It’s unlikely that you’d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.
Later symptoms of an underactive thyroid include:
a low-pitched and hoarse voice
a puffy-looking face
thinned or partly missing eyebrows
a slow heart rate
hearing loss
anaemia
Causes of an underactive thyroid
An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).
Most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of treatments for
thyroid cancer
or an
overactive thyroid
.
Immune system
An underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it’s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine, leading to the
symptoms of an underactive thyroid
.
A condition called Hashimoto’s disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction that causes an underactive thyroid.
It’s not clear what causes Hashimoto’s disease, but it runs in families. It’s also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as
type 1 diabetes
and vitiligo.
Previous thyroid treatment
An underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.
These treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid (where the thyroid gland produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.
Less common causes
Worldwide, a lack of dietary iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is uncommon in the UK.
Babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn’t develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It’s usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.
A problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.
An underactive thyroid has also been linked to some viral infections or some medications used to treat other conditions, such as:
lithium – a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including
depression
and
bipolar disorder
amiodarone – a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)
interferons – a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of
cancer
and
hepatitis C
Speak to your GP or specialist if you’re concerned that a medication you’re taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.
Diagnosing an underactive thyroid
It’s very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible.
Low levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), can change the way the body processes fat.
This can cause
high cholesterol
and
atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries)
, which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as
angina
and
heart attack
.
Therefore, you should see your GP and ask for a
blood test
if you repeatedly have
symptoms of an underactive thyroid
.
Thyroid function test
A blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether there’s a problem.
The test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood.
A high level of TSH and a low level of T4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid.
If your test results show raised TSH but normal T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.
Your GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid.
Blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called triiodothyronine (T3). However, this isn’t routine, because T3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid.
The
Lab Tests Online UK
website has more information about the different types of
thyroid function tests
.
Referral
Your GP may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you:
are younger than 16
are pregnant or trying to get pregnant
have just given birth
have another health condition, such as
heart disease
, which may complicate your medication
are taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithium
Treating an underactive thyroid
An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine.
Levothyroxine replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn’t make enough of.
You’ll initially have regular
blood tests
until the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached. This can take a little while to get right.
You may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds. Some people start to feel better soon after beginning treatment, while others don’t notice an improvement in their symptoms for several months
Once you’re taking the correct dose, you’ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.
If blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don’t have any symptoms or they’re very mild, you may not need any treatment. In these cases, your GP will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.
Taking levothyroxine
If you’re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take 1 tablet at the same time every day. It’s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night.
The effectiveness of the tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards.
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don’t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless advised otherwise by your doctor.
An underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you’ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.
Side effects
Levothyroxine doesn’t usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone.
Side effects usually only occur if you’re taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including sweating,
chest pain
,
headaches
,
diarrhoea
and vomiting.
Tell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. You should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don’t improve.
Combination therapy
In the UK, combination therapy – using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together – isn’t routinely used because there’s insufficient evidence to show it’s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy).
In most cases, suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as
atrial fibrillation
(an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate),
strokes
,
osteoporosis
and fracture.
However, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of
thyroid cancer
and there’s a significant risk of it reoccurring.
Complications of an underactive thyroid
Several complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn’t treated.
Heart problems
If you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developing
cardiovascular disease
is increased.
This is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood.
High cholesterol
can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting the flow of blood.
Contact your doctor if you’re being treated for an underactive thyroid and you develop
chest pain
, so that any problems can be detected and treated, if necessary.
Goitre
A goitre is an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat. Goitres can develop in people with an underactive thyroid when the body tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.
Pregnancy complications
If an underactive thyroid isn’t treated during pregnancy, there’s a risk of problems occurring. These include:
pre-eclampsia
– which can cause
high blood pressure
and fluid retention in the mother and growth problems in the baby
anaemia
in the mother
an underactive thyroid in the baby
birth defects
bleeding after birth
problems with the baby’s physical and mental development
premature birth or a low birthweight
stillbirth
or
miscarriage
These problems can usually be avoided with treatment under the guidance of a specialist in hormone disorders (an endocrinologist). Therefore, tell your GP if you have an underactive thyroid and you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant.
Myxoedema coma
In very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. This is where the thyroid hormone levels become very low, causing symptoms such as confusion,
hypothermia
and drowsiness.
Myxoedema coma requires emergency treatment in hospital. It’s usually treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication given directly into a vein. In some cases, other treatments such as breathing support,
antibiotics
and steroid medication (
corticosteroids
) are also required."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/vaginal-discharge/,"Vaginal discharge
You can experience vaginal discharge for many reasons. It doesn’t always mean you have an STI.
Vaginal discharge is nothing to worry about if it’s:
odourless (no unpleasant smell)
clear or white
thick and sticky
slippery and wet
The amount of discharge you might experience can vary. You might experience heavier or more frequent discharge if you’re:
pregnant
sexually active
using
contraception
, such as the contraceptive pill
During ovulation, you’ll notice more slippery and wet discharge, which is normal.
Contact your GP or sexual health service if:
You have vaginal discharge and:
you experience pelvic pain
you’re bleeding between periods or after sex
you experience pain when peeing
you feel itchy, sore or have blisters
your vaginal discharge changes in colour, smell or texture
You should look out for anything that doesn’t seem normal for you. This can include discharge which is:
foul-smelling
thick and white (like cottage cheese)
green or yellow and frothy
accompanied by pain or bleeding
accompanied by itchiness, blister or sores
STIs that can cause vaginal discharge include:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
genital herpes
trichomonas
If you’re sexually active and you experience any abnormal discharge,
contact your local sexual health clinic
to get tested for STIs.
Vaginal discharge can also be caused by
thrush
or
bacterial vaginosis
.
You might be asked to visit your local sexual health clinic for a vaginal examination to ensure you get the correct treatment.
Free treatment
If you’re experiencing discharge that you don’t think has been caused by an STI, you can
visit your local pharmacy
for advice.
If you experience discharge and think there’s a chance it could be caused by an STI, you should
contact your local sexual health clinic
. If they think you need treatment or aftercare for anything that’s caused vaginal discharge, you’ll be given this for free.
Free treatment is available for:
vaginal infections such as
bacterial vaginosis (BV)
and
thrush
all STIs
Genital hygiene
You can’t always prevent vaginal discharge. But it’s important to keep your vagina clean and healthy. Your vagina cleans itself internally. So you don’t need to clean inside with things like a vaginal douche.
You can use panty liners if you experience heavy discharge. But don’t use them all the time as they can cause irritation.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections. They can affect the urinary tract, including the:
bladder
urethra (the tube where urine leaves the body)
kidneys
UTIs aren’t usually serious and can be treated with antibiotics if needed.
Speak to your GP if your child has symptoms of a UTI like:
vomiting
tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)
irritability
not eating properly
not gaining weight
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) in very young children
pain or a burning sensation when peeing
needing to pee frequently
deliberately holding in their pee
a change in their normal toilet habits, like wetting themselves or wetting the bed
unpleasant-smelling pee
cloudy pee
Phone 111 or speak to a GP urgently if:
You think a child has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and they:
are under 3
have a very high temperature, or feel hot and shivery
have a very low temperature below 36C
are confused or drowsy
have pain in the lower tummy or in the back, just under the ribs
have blood in their pee
Types of UTI
A UTI may be either:
upper
lower
An upper UTI means an infection of the
kidneys
or ureters. Ureters are the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder.
A lower UTI means an infection of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra. This is the tube that carries urine out of the body.
Causes of UTIs in children
UTIs occur when the urinary tract becomes infected, usually by bacteria.
Bacteria from the gut can enter the urinary tract through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra). This may happen when a child:
wipes their bottom
soils their nappy
Some children may be more likely to get UTIs due to problems emptying their bladder. This can be due to:
constipation
dysfunctional elimination syndrome – a child ‘holds on’ to their pee, even though they have the urge to pee
vesicoureteral reflux – urine leaks back up from the bladder into the ureters and kidney
Treating UTIs in children
UTIs in children will often improve within 24 to 48 hours of treatment. A UTI won’t usually cause any long term problems.
Antibiotics
UTIs can usually be treated at home with antibiotics as long as the child is:
over 3 months
not at risk of serious illness
The most suitable antibiotic depends on what type of UTI the child has.
Sometimes children can experience side effects whilst taking antibiotics. This can include feeling sick or having an upset stomach. These symptoms are usually mild and should stop once the antibiotics have finished.
It’s very important to finish the prescribed course of antibiotics. This’ll prevent the infection from coming back.
Other treatments
If necessary, children can also take liquid
paracetamol
to help ease the symptoms of a UTI.
As a precaution, some children with a UTI may have to be treated in hospital. Your GP may advise you if this is necessary.
Don’t use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to treat a UTI. These can harm the kidneys.
Aspirin should never be given to children under the age of 16.
Preventing UTIs in children
It isn’t possible to prevent all childhood UTIs. But, there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of your child getting one.
Do
encourage girls to wipe their bottom from front to back
make sure children are well hydrated and go to the toilet regularly
avoid nylon and other synthetic underwear – pick loose, cotton underwear
avoid scented soaps or bubble baths – these can increase the risk of developing a UTI
Recurrent UTIs in children
A small number of children have recurring UTIs. If your child has had a UTI before, it’s important to watch out for any symptoms.
If any symptoms do come back, tell your GP as soon as possible."

About varicose eczema
Varicose eczema is a long-term skin condition that affects the lower legs and is common in people with
varicose veins
.
It is also known as venous eczema, gravitational eczema and stasis eczema.
Signs and symptoms
Like all types of eczema, the affected skin becomes:
itchy
red and swollen
dry and flaky
scaly or crusty
There may be periods when these symptoms improve and periods when they become more severe.
Your legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs.
Some people also have other symptoms, such as:
brown discolouration of the skin
red, tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis)
small, white scars (atrophie blanche)
pain
eczema affecting other parts of the body
Left untreated,
leg ulcers
can develop. These are long-lasting wounds that form where the skin has become damaged.
When to seek medical advice
See your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They will often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at the skin.
Read more about
diagnosing varicose eczema
.
What causes varicose eczema?
Varicose eczema is caused by increased pressure in the leg veins.
When the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it’s difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it can leak backwards.
This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.
Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren’t working properly.
Read more about the
causes of varicose eczema
.
How varicose eczema is treated
Varicose eczema tends to be a long-term problem. However, treatments are available to help keep it under control.
For most people, treatment involves a combination of:
self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs
emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry)
topical corticosteroids
– ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms
compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulation
If these treatments don’t help, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis.
If you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about the
treatment options for varicose veins
.
Read more about
treating varicose eczema
.
Causes of varicose eczema
Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins.
Inside your veins there are valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards.
Sometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. If the valves do not function properly, blood may leak backwards.
This increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin.
This increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged (
varicose veins
).
Who’s most at risk?
It is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken. Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are certain factors that increase the chances of this happening, including:
gender – varicose eczema is more common in women
obesity
– this can increase the pressure in your leg veins
pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins
not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation in your leg veins
having previously had
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
– blood clots that develop in leg veins, which can damage the valves in your veins
increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation
Diagnosing varicose eczema
See your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They can usually make a diagnosis by simply looking at the affected areas.
Your GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema.
To help make a diagnosis, your GP may want to know if you have a history of:
varicose veins
– swollen and enlarged veins
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
– a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs
leg ulcers
– areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal
cellulitis
– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue
surgery or injury to your legs
Your GP may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. See the section on
treating varicose eczema
for more information about these.
The ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use.
Referral to a specialist
You may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. This might be a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if:
you have varicose veins and changes to your skin, such as varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis (hard, tightened skin) or a history of leg ulcers
you have very poor blood flow in the blood vessels in your legs
your symptoms don’t get better, despite treatment
it is possible that you may have contact dermatitis

Treatment for varicose eczema aims to improve the condition of your skin, treat your symptoms and help improve your circulation (blood flow).
For many people, this will involve long-term treatment with a combination of:
emollients (moisturisers)
topical corticosteroids
compression stockings
There are also some self-help techniques that you can try. These treatment options are described in more detail below.
Lipodermatosclerosis (hardened, tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema. If you have a
venous leg ulcer
, you can also read about
treating venous leg ulcers
.
Self-help
There are some steps you can take to reduce the symptoms of varicose eczema and help prevent further problems, such as:
try to avoid injuring your skin – injuries to your skin could lead to an ulcer developing
raise your legs when you are resting – for example, by propping up your feet on some pillows (ideally so that they are above the level of your heart), as this can help reduce swelling
keep physically active – this will improve your circulation and help you maintain a healthy weight
Fluid can build up in the lower legs if you sit or stand for too long, so it is important to keep moving. Walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart.
The
National Eczema Society
also recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees.
Emollients
Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.
Choice of emollient
A number of different emollients are available. Some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your GP to recommend a suitable product.
You may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. You may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example:
an ointment for very dry skin
a cream or lotion for less dry skin
an emollient to use instead of soap
an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower
The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that they contain. Ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.
How to use emollients
If you have varicose eczema, you should use an emollient at least twice a day, even if you do not have any symptoms.
To apply the emollient:
use a large amount – you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas
don’t rub it in – instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows
apply every 2 to 3 hours for very dry skin
after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist
do not share emollients with other people
It is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture. Apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up.
Side effects
It’s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). If you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your GP, who can prescribe an alternative product.
Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.
Topical corticosteroids
If your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. They are also commonly known as topical steroids.
Different strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. If you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid.
How to use topical corticosteroids
When using corticosteroids, only apply the treatment to the affected areas. Your doctor can advise you on how much to apply and how often. You can also check the advice in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication.
Most people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. When applying the medication, you should:
apply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin)
apply it only to the affected area
use the topical corticosteroid for 7 to 14 days and continue to apply the treatment for 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared
If your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them.
If you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. Your GP will advise you on how often you should be applying them.
You should also speak to your GP if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.
Side effects
Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream.
Generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it.
Compression stockings
Medical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. They are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart.
Medical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins.
Choice of compression stockings
Compression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. They are also available in:
different colours
different lengths – some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema)
different foot styles – some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toes
Support stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. Compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first.
In some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead.
Wearing compression stockings
You will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. Wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them.
Pull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly.
Take care when putting compression stockings on and taking them off, as this can damage fragile skin. If you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings.
Caring for compression stockings
Compression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3 to 6 months. Speak to your GP if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective.
You should be prescribed 2 stockings (or 2 sets of stockings if you are wearing 1 on each leg) so that 1 stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat.
Treating varicose veins
If you have
varicose veins
, as well as varicose eczema, treating these may sometimes be helpful.
If your GP thinks treatment may be beneficial, they can refer you to a vascular surgeon, who can arrange for an
ultrasound scan
of your leg to find the faulty blood vessels. Treatment of your varicose veins can then be planned.
There are a number of treatments available that can improve the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins, including:
endothermal ablation – where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used to seal the affected veins
sclerotherapy – where a special foam is injected into your veins to seal them
ligation and stripping – where affected veins are tied off and surgically removed
These procedures are usually performed in the day surgery department of a hospital.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/vertigo/,"Vertigo
Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It’s the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.
This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks.
Vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds or much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making daily life very difficult.
Symptoms of vertigo may include:
loss of balance – which can make it difficult to stand or walk
feeling sick or being sick
dizziness
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
your vertigo comes on suddenly
you have vertigo that will not go away
you have vertigo that keeps coming back
vertigo is affecting your daily life
Diagnosing vertigo
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and can carry out an examination to help determine some types of vertigo. They may also refer you for further tests.
What causes vertigo?
Inner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes of vertigo. It can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain.
Causes of vertigo may include:
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where certain head movements trigger vertigo
migraine
labyrinthitis
or vestibular neuronitis – an inner ear infection
Ménière’s disease
Depending on the condition causing vertigo, you may have other symptoms, such as:
a high temperature
ringing in your ears (
tinnitus
)
hearing loss
Treatment for vertigo
Most people with vertigo get better without treatment. Treatment will depend on the cause.
Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines, can help in most cases of vertigo.
Your GP may refer you to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist or a balance physiotherapist if needed.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
There may be things you can do yourself to help your symptoms, and reduce how often you have vertigo.
Do
lie still in a quiet, dark room to reduce the spinning feeling
move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities
sit down straight away when you feel dizzy
turn on the lights if you get up at night
use a walking stick if you’re at risk of falling
sleep with your head slightly raised on 2 or more pillows
get up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing
try to relax and avoid stress – anxiety can make vertigo worse
Don’t
do not bend over to pick things up – squat to lower yourself instead
do not stretch your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf
Safety
If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example:
you should tell your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders
you may have a higher chance of falling – read about
preventing falls
for advice on reducing your risk
Driving and vertigo
If you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo.
Further information on driving with vertigo on GOV.UK
Fear of heights
The term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is ‘acrophobia’.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/kidneys-bladder-and-prostate/urinary-incontinence/,"Urinary incontinence
Urinary incontinence is when you pee by accident. It can happen when doing exercise like running, lifting weights at the gym or jumping on a trampoline.
Urinary incontinence can affect anyone. It tends to be more common in women.
Further information about
urinary incontinence in women
Although it’s common, it shouldn’t be thought of as normal. There are things you can do to reduce the chance of this happening and improve your symptoms.
How to prevent urinary incontinence
There are things you can do that may help reduce the chance of urinary incontinence in the future.
Do
strengthen you pelvic floor muscles with simple pelvic floor exercises
stay active
maintain a healthy weight
avoid or cut down on alcohol and caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, tea and some fizzy drinks
Types of urinary incontinence
The 2 most common types of urinary incontinence are:
stress incontinence – pee leaking out when your bladder is under pressure (life when you laugh, cough, sneeze, exercise or lift something heavy)
urge incontinence – feeling a sudden and very intense need to pee and being unable to stop it
Less common types of incontinence are:
mixed incontinence – having both stress and urge incontinence
overflow incontinence (also called chronic urinary retention) – the bladder cannot completely empty
total incontinence – severe and continuous urinary incontinence
When to get medical advice
Speak to your GP practice if:
You have any symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as:
peeing by accident
feeling a sudden need to pee and are unable to stop it
What causes urinary incontinence?
The causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type.
Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including:
being overweight
a family history of incontinence
getting older – but incontinence doesn’t happen just because you’ve aged
if you’re a woman, pregnancy and vaginal birth
if you’re a man, having surgery to remove the prostate gland
Diagnosing urinary incontinence
Your GP will ask you some questions to understand what may be causing the incontinence and how bad it is.
They may also:
try to rule out other things that could be causing your symptoms, such as a
urinary tract infection
suggest you keep a diary of how much fluid you drink and how often you have to pee
carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men) – as this is an intimate examination, there may be another person (chaperone) present
refer you to a specialist, usually a physiotherapist
Treatment for urinary incontinence
Treatments which do not involve taking medication or having surgery are usually tried first. These include:
treating the underlying cause, if urinary incontinence is caused by another condition
lifestyle changes – such as reducing your caffeine intake, changing how much you drink, and maintaining a
healthy weight
pelvic floor muscle training – your healthcare professional will explain how to do these exercises
bladder training – techniques to increase the length of time between feeling the need to go to the toilet and peeing
Incontinence products (like pads or pants) aren’t a treatment for urinary incontinence. But you might find them helpful while you are waiting for assessment or for a treatment to start working.
If these treatments don’t work for you, your doctor may suggest trying other treatments, like medication or surgery. This will depend on the cause and type of incontinence you are experiencing.
It’s ok to ask any questions about your care
to help you get the information you might need."

About vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can’t function properly.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin.
Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell.
There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example,
iron deficiency anaemia
, which occurs when the body doesn’t contain enough iron.
Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.
A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:
extreme tiredness
a lack of energy
pins and needles (paraesthesia)
a sore and red tongue
mouth ulcers
muscle weakness
disturbed vision
psychological problems, which may include
depression
and confusion
problems with memory, understanding and judgement
Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don’t have anaemia.

symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
When to see your GP
See your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a
blood test

Causes of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including:
pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK
a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time
medication – certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs
Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74.
Read about the
causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.
Vitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you’ll either require B12 tablets between meals or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life.
Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months.
In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas.

Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Although it’s uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you’ve been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time.
Potential complications can include:
problems with the nervous system
temporary infertility
heart conditions
pregnancy complications and birth defects
Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure.
Some complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others – such as problems with the nervous system – can be permanent.

complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can cause a wide range of symptoms. These usually develop gradually but can worsen if the condition goes untreated.
Anaemia is where you have fewer red blood cells than normal or you have an abnormally low amount of a substance called haemoglobin in each red blood cell. General symptoms of anaemia may include:
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
lack of energy (lethargy)
breathlessness
feeling faint
headaches
pale skin
noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)
hearing sounds coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (
tinnitus
)
loss of appetite and weight loss
Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency
If you have anaemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may have other symptoms in addition to those listed above, such as:
a pale yellow tinge to your skin
a sore and red tongue (glossitis)
mouth ulcers
pins and needles (paraesthesia)
changes in the way that you walk and move around
disturbed vision
irritability
depression
changes in the way you think, feel and behave
a decline in your mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgement (
dementia
)
Some of these symptoms can also occur in people who have a vitamin B12 deficiency, but have not developed anaemia.
Symptoms of folate deficiency
Additional symptoms in people with anaemia caused by a folate deficiency can include:
symptoms related to anaemia
reduced sense of taste
diarrhoea
numbness and tingling in the feet and hands
muscle weakness
depression
When to see your GP
See your GP if you’re experiencing symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.
Read more about
diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
It’s important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible if left untreated. The longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage.
Causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body’s ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Most people with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are larger than normal. The medical term for this is “megaloblastic anaemia”.
A vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below.
Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency
Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.
Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means your immune system (the body’s natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body’s healthy cells.
In your stomach, vitamin B12 is combined with a protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum.
Pernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means your body is unable to absorb vitamin B12.
The exact cause of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as
Addison’s disease
or vitiligo.
Diet
Some people can develop a vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin B12 from their diet.
A diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin B12, but people who don’t regularly eat these foods – such as those following a vegan diet or who have a generally very poor diet – can become deficient.
Stores of vitamin B12 in the body can last around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for any problems to develop after a dietary change.
Conditions affecting the stomach
Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of enough vitamin B12.
For example, a gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency.
Conditions affecting the intestines
Some conditions that affect your intestines can also stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12.
For example,
Crohn’s disease
(a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn’t get enough vitamin B12.
Medication
Some types of medicine can lead to a reduction in the amount of vitamin B12 in your body.
For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – a medication sometimes used to treat indigestion – can make a vitamin B12 deficiency worse. PPIs inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin B12 from the food you eat.
Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin B12 levels and will monitor you if necessary.
Functional vitamin B12 deficiency
Some people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood.
This can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency – where there’s a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in neurological complications involving the spinal cord.
Causes of folate deficiency
Folate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body’s store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.
Like vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below.
Diet
Good sources of folate include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. If you don’t regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency.
Folate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn’t involve eating good sources of folate.
Malabsorption
Sometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as
coeliac disease
.
Excessive urination
You may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as:
congestive
heart failure
– where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body
acute liver damage – often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
long-term
dialysis
– where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood
Medication
Some types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb.
These include some anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate.
Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary.
Other causes
Your body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency if you can’t meet your body’s demands for the vitamin.
Your body may need more folate than usual if you:
are pregnant (see below)
have cancer
have a blood disorder – such as
sickle cell anaemia
(an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally)
are fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling)
Premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) are also more likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal.
Pregnancy
If you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it’s recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you’re 12 weeks pregnant. This will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop.
Folic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your GP, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores.
If you’re pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body’s need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your GP will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic.
In some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. For example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg or 5,000 micrograms) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 0.4 milligrams (0.4mg or 400 micrograms).

vitamins and minerals in pregnancy
Diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
A diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your GP based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests.
Blood tests
Different types of
blood tests
can be carried out to help identify people with a possible vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check:
whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) than normal
whether your red blood cells are larger than normal
the level of vitamin B12 in your blood
the level of folate in your blood
However, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins or may have low levels despite having no symptoms. This is why it’s important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made.
A particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood.
This means it measures forms of vitamin B12 that are “active” and can be used by your body, as well as the “inactive” forms, which can’t. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is “inactive”, a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels, even though your body can’t use much of it.
There are some types of blood test that may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren’t yet widely available.
Identifying the cause
If your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, your GP may arrange further tests. If the cause can be identified, it will help to determine the most appropriate treatment.
For example, you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you’re unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat.
Tests for pernicious anaemia aren’t always conclusive, but they can often give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition.
Referral to a specialist
You may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. This may include:
a haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) – if you have vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your GP is uncertain of the cause, you’re pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected
a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) – if your GP suspects you don’t have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn’t absorbing it properly
a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) – if your GP suspects you have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet
A dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet.
Treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
The treatment for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what’s causing the condition. Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.
Treating vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia
Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin.
At first, you’ll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. Your GP or nurse will give the injections.
After this initial period, your treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which isn’t related to your diet.
Read more about the
causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
Diet-related
If your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.
People who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life.
Although it’s less common, people with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and their diet has improved.
Good sources of vitamin B12 include:
meat
salmon and cod
milk and other dairy products
eggs
If you’re a vegetarian and vegan, or are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products.
Check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12 different foods contain.
Not diet-related
If your vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you’ll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life.
If you’ve had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you’ll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. Your haematologist will advise on how long you need to keep taking the injections.
For injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer.
If you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months.
Cyanocobalamin injections aren’t routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin.
Treating folate deficiency anaemia
To treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake.
Good sources of folate include:
broccoli
Brussels sprouts
asparagus
peas
chickpeas
brown rice
Most people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer – possibly for life.
Before you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they’re normal. This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency.
If a vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system.
Monitoring your condition
To ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further
blood tests
.
A blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. This is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood.
Another blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful.
If you’ve been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months).
Most people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency won’t need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. If your GP feels it’s necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.
Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
As most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare.
However, complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you’ve been deficient in either vitamin for some time.
Anaemia complications
All types of anaemia, regardless of the cause, can lead to heart and lung complications as the heart struggles to pump oxygen to the vital organs.
Adults with severe anaemia are at risk of developing:
an abnormally fast heart beat (tachycardia)
heart failure
– where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure
Complications of vitamin B12 deficiency
A lack of vitamin B12 (with or without anaemia) can cause the following complications:
Neurological changes
A lack of vitamin B12 can cause neurological problems (issues affecting your nervous system), such as:
vision problems
memory loss
pins and needles (paraesthesia)
loss of physical coordination (ataxia), which can affect your whole body and cause difficulty speaking or walking
damage to parts of the nervous system (
peripheral neuropathy
), particularly in the legs
If neurological problems do develop, they may be irreversible.
Infertility
Vitamin B12 deficiency can sometimes lead to temporary infertility (an inability to conceive). This usually improves with appropriate vitamin B12 treatment.
Stomach cancer
If you have a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anaemia (a condition where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach), your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased.
Neural tube defects
If you’re pregnant, not having enough vitamin B12 can increase the risk of your baby developing a serious birth defect known as a neural tube defect. The neural tube is a narrow channel that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord.
Examples of neural tube defects include:
spina bifida – where the baby’s spine doesn’t develop properly
anencephaly – where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull
encephalocele – where a membrane or skin-covered sac containing part of the brain pushes out of a hole in the skull
Complications of folate deficiency
A lack of folate (with or without anaemia) can also cause complications, some of which are outlined below.
Infertility
As with a lack of vitamin B12, a folate deficiency can also affect your fertility. However, this is only temporary and can usually be reversed with folate supplements.
Cardiovascular disease
Research has shown a lack of folate in your body may increase your risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD)
.
CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as
coronary heart disease (CHD)
.
Cancer
Research has shown that folate deficiency can increase your risk of some cancers, such as
colon cancer
.
Problems in childbirth
A lack of folate during pregnancy may increase the risk of the baby being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or having a low birthweight.
The risk of placental abruption may also be increased. This is a serious condition where the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall, causing
tummy (abdominal) pain
and bleeding from the vagina.
Neural tube defects
As with a vitamin B12 deficiency, a lack of folate can also affect an unborn baby’s growth and development in the womb (uterus). This increases the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida developing in the unborn baby."

Nausea and vomiting in adults isn’t usually a sign of anything serious. It tends to only last 1 or 2 days.
Vomiting is the body’s way of getting rid of harmful substances from the stomach, or it may be a reaction to something that has irritated the gut.
One of the most common causes of vomiting in adults is
gastroenteritis
. This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus. It’ll normally improve within a few days.
Vomiting can occasionally be a sign of something more serious, such as
appendicitis
.
There is a separate page on
vomiting in children and babies
.

Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
You’re vomiting and you also have:
sudden, severe abdominal (tummy) pain
severe chest pain
blood in your vomit or what looks like coffee granules
have green or yellow-green vomit
a stiff neck and high temperature (fever)
a sudden, severe
headache
that’s unlike any headache you’ve had before
swallowed something poisonous, or think you may have
have a stiff neck and pain when looking at bright lights
Speak to your GP if:
you’ve been vomiting repeatedly for more than a day or two
you’re unable to keep down any fluids because you’re vomiting repeatedly
you have
signs of severe dehydration
, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine
you’ve lost a lot of weight since you became ill
you experience episodes of vomiting frequently
you’re worried about your vomiting and are feeling very unwell
you have
diabetes
and have been vomiting a lot, particularly if you take insulin as it can affect your blood sugar level
Common causes of vomiting in adults
Gastroenteritis
If you have
diarrhoea
as well as vomiting, it’s likely you have gastroenteritis. This is one of the most common causes of vomiting in adults.
It’s often caused by:
a virus, like
norovirus
food poisoning
caused by bacteria in contaminated food
Your immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days.
Pregnancy
Pregnant women often experience nausea and vomiting, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This is often called morning sickness but it can happen at any time of the day.
Migraines
If you have recurrent episodes of vomiting along with intense, throbbing headaches that last for a few hours to days at a time, you may be experiencing
migraines
.
Pain relief, such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
, can sometimes help control the pain. Your GP can prescribe anti-sickness medicine to help prevent vomiting.
Labyrinthitis
If you also feel dizzy, or feel like you’re spinning (
vertigo
), you may have an inner ear infection called
labyrinthitis
.
Labyrinthitis will usually improve over a few days. Your GP can prescribe medication to reduce your symptoms if needed.
Motion sickness
Nausea and vomiting when travelling could be a sign of motion sickness.
You can try:
looking at the horizon
distracting yourself by listening to music
Appendicitis
As well as vomiting,
appendicitis
can cause severe pain in your abdomen (tummy). You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you experience pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs that you appendix may have burst.
If you have appendicitis, you will often need surgery to remove your appendix.
Other causes of vomiting in adults
Vomiting in adults can also be caused by a number of other things, including:
certain medicines, such as
antibiotics
and opioid painkillers
drinking too much alcohol
kidney infections
and
kidney stones
a blockage in your bowel, which may be caused by a hernia or
gallstones
chemotherapy
or
radiotherapy
acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder)
Looking after yourself at home
Mostly, you can take care of yourself at home until you feel better.
Do
keep taking small sips of water frequently so you don’t become dehydrated
drink a sweet drink such as fruit juice to replace lost sugar, unless it make you feel sick
eat salty snacks, such as crisps, which can help replace lost salt
try ginger (in supplements, biscuits or tea) – but check with your pharmacist or GP before using ginger supplements"

About trigeminal neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock.
It usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly.
In the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face, with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time.
People with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day.
It’s possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.
Typically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever.
Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.

When to seek medical advice
You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.
Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.
However, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.

diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia
What causes trigeminal neuralgia?
In the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.
This compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.
In rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as
multiple sclerosis (MS)
or a tumour.

causes of trigeminal neuralgia
Who is affected
It’s not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare.
Some studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK.
The condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.
How trigeminal neuralgia is treated
Trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment.
The first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat
epilepsy
) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream.
Unless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor.
Carbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.
If this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help.
There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years.
Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as
hearing loss
, facial numbness or, very rarely, a
stroke
.

treating trigeminal neuralgia
Symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia
The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.
The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.
Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.
You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.
After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.
You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.
Symptom triggers
Attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:
talking
smiling
chewing
brushing your teeth
washing your face
a light touch
shaving or putting on make-up
swallowing
kissing
a cool breeze or air conditioning
head movements
vibrations, such as walking or a car journey
However, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.
Further problems
Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.
You may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.
The emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as
depression
. During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider
suicide
. Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.
When to see your GP
You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.
Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.

diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia
Causes of trigeminal neuralgia
Although the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve.
The trigeminal nerve
The trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. You have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. Small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. These are:
the upper branch (ophthalmic) – which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head
the middle branch (maxillary) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums
the lower branch (mandibular) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums
These branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the Gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa.
Trigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected.
Pressure on the trigeminal nerve
Evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the Gasserian ganglion.
In most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it’s not known why this happens.
It’s also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. It may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve.
However, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve.
Other underlying causes
Other reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include:
a tumour (a growth or lump)
a cyst (fluid-filled sac)
arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins)
multiple sclerosis (MS)
– a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)
Diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia
As the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their GP.
If you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dental
X-ray
and other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth.
If the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. If your dentist can’t find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem.
Often, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your GP.
Seeing your GP
There is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain.
If you have experienced facial pain, your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. The more details about your pain you can provide, the better.
Your GP will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful.
Ruling out other conditions
An important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain.
By asking about your symptoms and carrying out an examination, your GP may be able to rule out other conditions, such as:
migraine
joint pain in the lower jaw
giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) – a condition in which medium and large arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and cause pain in the jaw and temples
a possible injury to one of the facial nerves
Your medical, personal and family history will also need to be taken into consideration when determining possible causes of your pain.
For example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, and
multiple sclerosis (MS)
may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. However, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of MS.
MRI scans
If your GP is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
of your head.
An MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. It can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such as
sinusitis
(inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by MS.
An MRI can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main
causes of trigeminal neuralgia
. However, highly sophisticated MRI scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia.
Treating trigeminal neuralgia
There are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.
Identifying triggers and avoiding them can also help.
Most people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects.
Avoid triggers
The painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. Therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible.
For example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. A transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather.
Hot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. Using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. It is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals.
Certain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas.
Medication
As normal painkillers such as
paracetamol
are not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat
epilepsy
) to help control your pain.
These medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain.
They need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.  Unless otherwise instructed by your GP or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. Taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems.
Initially, your GP will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable.
Carbamazepine
The anticonvulsant carbamazepine is currently the only medication licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the UK. It can be very effective initially, but may become less effective over time.
You will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief.
Carbamazepine often causes side effects, which may make it difficult for some people to take. These include:
tiredness and sleepiness
dizziness (lightheadedness)
difficulty concentrating and memory problems
confusion
feeling unsteady on your feet
feeling sick and vomiting
double vision
a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia)
allergic skin reactions, such as urticaria (hives)
You should speak to your GP if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous.
Carbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts of
self-harm
or
suicide
. You should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your GP. If this is not possible, call the NHS 24
111
service.
Other medications
Carbamazepine may stop working over time. If this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures.
There are a number of specialists you may be referred to for further treatment, including neurologists specialising in headaches, neurosurgeons and pain medicine specialists (for example, at a pain clinic).
In addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including:
oxcarbazepine
lamotrigine
gabapentin
pregabalin
baclofen
None of these medications are specifically licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which means they have not undergone rigorous clinical trials to determine whether they are effective and safe to treat the condition.
However, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, “dummy” medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical.
However, many specialists will prescribe an unlicensed medication if they think it is likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks.
If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you.
With most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. Not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. Talk to your GP if you are finding the side effects unbearable.
Surgery and procedures
If medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain.
There a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. It is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual.
There is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won’t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. If one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently.
Some of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below.
Percutaneous procedures
There are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull.
These are known can “percutaneous” (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out using
X-rays
to guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under a
general anaesthetic
(where you are asleep).
Percutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include:
glycerol injections – where a medication called glycerol in injected around the Gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together)
radiofrequency lesioning – where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the Gasserian ganglion
balloon compression – where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the Gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removed
These procedures work by deliberately injuring or damaging the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to disrupt the pain signals travelling along it. You are usually able to go home the same day, following your treatment.
Overall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. The pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. Sometimes these procedures do not work at all.
The major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. The sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. Very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable.
The procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles.
Stereotactic radiosurgery
An alternative way to relieve pain by damaging the trigeminal nerve that doesn’t involve inserting anything through the skin is stereotactic radiosurgery. This is a fairly new treatment that uses a concentrated beam of radiation to deliberately damage the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem.
Stereotactic radiosurgery does not require a general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek.
A metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (a
local anaesthetic
is used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. The frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest.
It can take a few weeks – or sometimes many months – for this procedure to take effect, but it can offer pain relief for some people for several months or years. Studies into this treatment have shown similar results to the other procedures mentioned above.
The most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. This can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome.
Microvascular decompression
Microvascular decompression (MVD) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. Instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it.
This is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon.
During MVD, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. They will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue.
For many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.  Currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia.
However, it’s an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss,
stroke
and even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases).
More information and support
Living with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult.
You may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the
Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK
, for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences.
Research has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. Learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression.
However, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering “cures” for the condition. There is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media.
There are a number of research projects running both in the UK and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon."
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/wilms-tumour/,"Wilms’ tumour
Wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer in children. It most often affects children under the age of 5.
More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.
It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.
Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.
Wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It’s thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child’s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms’ tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found.
The kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. They clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine.
Causes
In most children, the causes of Wilms’ tumour are unknown. Very rarely, people who develop Wilms’ tumour have other specific conditions which are present at birth (congenital malformations). These include the lack of an iris in the eye (aniridia), abnormalities of the genitals, and a condition where one side of the body is slightly larger than the other (hemihypertrophy).
In 1 in 100 people with Wilms’ tumour, another family member will also have Wilms’ tumour.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.
How Wilms’ tumour is diagnosed
A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms’ tumour.
An abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an
MRI
and/or
CT scan
of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child’s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a
biopsy
, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.
Staging
The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and the stage of the cancer helps doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment.
In the case of a Wilms’ tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. As most Wilms’ tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child’s tumour straight away. An exception is that babies under 6 months old usually have surgery straight away.
Stage 1
The tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. It can be completely removed with surgery.
Stage 2
The tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it’s still possible to remove it completely with surgery.
Stage 3
The tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery.
Stage 4
The tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. Tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases.
Stage 5
There are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral Wilms’ tumour).
If the tumour comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent cancer or relapse.
Treatment
Treatment is planned by specialists in children’s tumours and cancers. This is usually based in a children’s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home.
Treatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.
Surgery
All children with Wilms’ tumour will have surgery. Initially, this may only involve taking a small sample of cells from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. This is called a biopsy and is usually done under a general anaesthetic using a needle inserted through the skin.
Apart from very young children (under 6 months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. The operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy).
After examining the whole tumour under the microscope, Wilms’ tumours can be divided into a number of risk groups based on knowledge about how these different types of tumours are likely to behave. The treatment following surgery will depend on these risk groups. The risk groups are known as LOW, STANDARD (or INTERMEDIATE), and HIGH.
The majority of tumours are in the ‘standard risk’ group. So-called ‘low risk’ tumours require less treatment than standard risk tumours.
Two types of Wilms’ tumour – anaplastic and blastemal – are considered to be ‘higher risk’ than other Wilms’ tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy.
Anaplastic Wilms’ tumour
About 5% to 10% of Wilms’ tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope.
Blastemal Wilms’ tumour
This group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. These cells are known as blastemal cells. Tumours, where most of these cells survive chemotherapy, are called blastemal tumours.
Other kidney tumours
Other, less common types of kidney tumours may occur in children. These are usually only recognised after surgery to obtain a tumour sample. ‘Clear cell sarcoma’ and ‘malignant rhabdoid tumour’ of the kidney are 2 types of cancerous tumour, with their own treatment recommendations.
Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumour that occurs in very young children. This type of tumour usually only needs surgery and no other treatment.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
What doctors find out about the tumour after surgery – for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread – helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). This is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). This chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.
Not all children with Wilms’ tumour need radiotherapy. For those that do, the area to be treated depends on the stage of the tumour at diagnosis. Some children receive radiotherapy to the area around the affected kidney or, less commonly, to the whole abdomen. If the tumour has spread to the lungs, then lung radiotherapy may be needed but this depends on how well the cancer responds to initial chemotherapy; it’s not always needed.
Radiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. This will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. Radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body.
Treatment for bilateral Wilms’ tumour
In about 1 in 20 cases, Wilms’ tumour affects both kidneys. Treatment usually involves surgery to both. The aim of the treatment is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, while leaving as much healthy kidney as possible. Chemotherapy is always given. Sometimes radiotherapy is needed as well.
Side effects of treatment
Treatment for Wilms’ tumour often causes side effects. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Many side effects are expected and managed effectively. Side effects can include feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), hair loss, bruising and bleeding, tiredness, diarrhoea, and an increased risk of infection. Less common effects may include impact on the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Late side effects
A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. Infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare.
Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. These will depend on the exact treatments given.
Clinical trials
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness. The trial may include comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It may just involve collecting patient and tumour details including response to treatment to increase specialists’ knowledge. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Treatment guidelines
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The
Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group
(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
Follow-up care
Most children with Wilms’ tumour are cured. If the cancer comes back, it’s usually within the first 2 years. When one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney.
Very few children have long-term kidney problems. Your child will have regular check-ups to look for any recurrence or problems following treatment.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.
Your feelings
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet
Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide
talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."

About vulval cancer
Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women and anyone with a vulva.
The vulva is a woman’s external genitals. It includes the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ that helps reach sexual climax), and the Bartholin’s glands (2 small glands each side of the vagina).
Most of those affected by vulval cancer are older women and anyone with a vulva over the age of 65. The condition is rare in women and anyone with a vulva under 50 who have not yet gone through the
menopause
.
Symptoms of vulval cancer
Symptoms of vulval cancer can include:
a persistent itch in the vulva
pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva
raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark
a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva
bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods
an open sore in the vulva
a burning pain when passing urine
a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour
Speak to your GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of cancer, these changes should be investigated.
Read more about
diagnosing vulval cancer
.
What causes vulval cancer?
The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors:
increasing age
vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) – where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous
persistent infection with certain versions of the human papilloma virus (HPV)
skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus
smoking
You may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection.
Read more about the
causes of vulval cancer
.
How vulval cancer is treated
The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.
Some people may also have
radiotherapy
(where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or
chemotherapy
(where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you’re not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it isn’t possible to remove it all.
Read more about
treating vulval cancer
.
Can vulval cancer be prevented?
It’s not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by:
practising safer sex – using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV
attending
cervical screening
appointments – cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN
stopping smoking
The
HPV vaccination
may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is offered to all girls who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme.
Causes of vulval cancer
Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
The exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.
These include:
increasing age
vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)
human papilloma virus (HPV) infection
skin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus
smoking
Increasing age
The risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. Most cases develop in women and anyone with a vulva aged 65 or over. Very occasionally women and anyone with a vulva under 50 can be affected.
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition. This means there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren’t cancerous, but could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. This is a gradual process that usually takes well over 10 years.
In some cases, the abnormal cells may go away by themselves. However, because of the risk of cancer, treatment to remove the affected cells is often recommended.
Symptoms of VIN are similar to those of vulval cancer, and include persistent itchiness of the vulva and raised discoloured patches. Speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.
There are 2 types of VIN:
usual or undifferentiated VIN – this usually affects women and anyone with a vulva under 50 and is thought to be caused by an HPV infection
differentiated VIN (dVIN) – this is a rarer type, usually affecting women and anyone with a vulva over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulva
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. It’s spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.
There are many different types of HPV, and most people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to further problems.
However, HPV is present in at least 40% of people with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to
cervical cancer
. It’s thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is known as VIN.
Skin conditions
Several skin conditions can affect the vulva. In a small number of cases these are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer.
Two of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus and
lichen planus
. Both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured.
It’s estimated that less than 5% of those who develop one of these conditions will go on to develop vulval cancer. It’s not clear whether treating these conditions reduces this risk.
Smoking
Smoking increases your risk of developing VIN and vulval cancer. This may be because smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the HPV virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus.
Diagnosing vulval cancer
Speak to your GP if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva.
Your GP will ask you about your symptoms, look at your medical history, and examine your vulva to look for any lumps or unusual areas of skin.
If you would prefer to be examined by a female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your GP practice know in advance of your appointment.
Referral to a gynaecologist
If your GP feels some further tests are necessary, they will refer you to a hospital specialist called a gynaecologist. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or ulcer, or unexplained bleeding.
The gynaecologist will ask about your symptoms and examine your vulva again, and they may recommend a test called a biopsy to determine whether you do have cancer.
Biopsy
A
biopsy
is where a small sample of tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous.
This is often done after a
local anaesthetic
has been given to numb the area, which means the procedure shouldn’t be painful and you can go home the same day. Occasionally, it may be done under
general anaesthetic
(where you’re asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital.
Your doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from. You may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards.
Your doctor will usually see you 7 to 10 days later to discuss the results with you.
Further tests
If the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is.
These may include:
a colposcopy – a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina
a cystoscopy – an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow tube inserted into the bladder
a proctoscopy – an examination of the inside of the rectum
biopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva to check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
– scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs
an
X-ray
to check that cancer has not spread to your lungs
The results of these tests will allow your doctor to ‘stage’ your cancer. This means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread.
Staging
Vulval cancers are staged using a number from 1 to 4. The lower the stage, the less the cancer has spread and the greater the chance of treatment being successful.
The staging system for vulval cancer is:
stage 1 – the cancer is confined to the vulva
stage 2 – the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected
stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes
stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodes
Stage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. Stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible.
Treating vulval cancer
Treatment for vulval cancer depends on factors such as how far the cancer has spread, your general health, and personal wishes.
The main options are surgery,
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
. Many women and anyone with a vulva with vulval cancer have a combination of these treatments.
If your cancer is at an early stage, it’s often possible to get rid of it completely. However, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread.
Even after successful treatment, there is up to a 1 in 3 chance of the cancer returning at some point later on, so you’ll need regular follow-up appointments to check for this.
Your treatment plan
Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat vulval cancer. MDTs are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.
Members of your MDT will probably include a specialist surgeon, a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer (clinical oncologist) and a specialist cancer nurse.
Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.
Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.
Surgery to remove vulval cancer
In most cases, your treatment plan will involve some form of surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer.
There are 3 surgical options to treat vulval cancer:
radical wide local excision – the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least 1cm wide, as a precaution
radical partial vulvectomy – a larger section of your vulva is removed, such as 1 or both of the labia and the clitoris
radical vulvectomy – the whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoris
The time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. For extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months before you start to feel better.
Your surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you’re having. Possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex.
Assessing and removing groin lymph nodes
An additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they’re found to contain cancer.
Sentinel node biopsy
If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it’s sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as sentinel nodes.
Sentinel nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying its flow to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. These are then removed and checked for cancerous cells.
Groin lymphadenectomy
In some cases, some or all of the nodes in your groin may need to be surgically removed. This is called a groin or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Further treatment with radiotherapy may also be recommended.
Removing cancerous lymph nodes reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid
(lymphoedema)
.
Pelvic exenteration
In cases of advanced vulval cancer or where the cancer returns after previous treatment, an operation called a pelvic exenteration may be recommended. This involves removing your entire vulva as well as your bladder, womb and part of your bowel. This is a major operation and isn’t carried out very often these days.
If a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). Stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. This is known as a
colostomy
.
If your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. This is known as a urostomy. Alternatively, it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in.
Reconstructive surgery
If only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva can often be neatly stitched together.
Otherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a skin graft, where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or tummy and moved to the wound in your vulva. Another option is to have a skin flap, where an area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and cover the wound.
These reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy
involves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. There are several ways it can be used to treat vulval cancer:
before surgery to try to shrink a large cancer – this is to help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs
after surgery to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left – for example, for cases where cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin
as an alternative to surgery, if you’re not well enough to have an operation
to relieve symptoms in cases where a complete cure is not possible – this is known as palliative radiotherapy
In most cases, you’ll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation on to the section of the body that contains the cancer.
This is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.
Side effects
While radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. This can lead to a number of side effects, such as:
sore skin around the vulva area
diarrhoea
feeling tired all the time
loss of pubic hair, which may be permanent
swelling of the vulva
narrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult
inflammation of your bladder
(cystitis)
In younger people, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger an
early menopause
. This means they will no longer be able to have any children.
Read more about the
side effects of radiotherapy
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is where medication is used to kill cancer cells. It’s usually given by injection.
It’s usually used if vulval cancer comes back or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible. Sometimes it may be combined with radiotherapy.
Side effects
The medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. Side effects are common and include:
tiredness
feeling and being sick
hair thinning or hair loss
sore mouth and
mouth ulcers
an increased risk of infections – tell your care team if you develop any symptoms of an infection, and try to avoid close contact with people known to have an infection
These side effects should pass once treatment has finished.
Read more about the
side effects of chemotherapy
.
Emotional support
The emotional impact of living with vulval cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a kind of rollercoaster effect. You may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, feel up when the cancer has been removed from your body, and then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of surgery.
Some people experience feelings of
depression
. If you think you may be depressed, contact your GP or care team for advice. There are a range of treatments that can help.
You may also find it useful to contact one of the main cancer charities, such as:
Macmillan Cancer Support
– the helpline is available on 0808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm
Cancer Research UK
– a cancer nurse helpline is available on 0808 800 4040, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/yellow-fever/,"Yellow fever
Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is spread by certain types of mosquito. It’s mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and parts of the Caribbean.
The condition can be prevented with a vaccination and is a very rare cause of illness in travellers.
Between 1999 and 2018, there were 12 cases of yellow fever reported among European travellers. None of these travellers were vaccinated, 5 of these cases occurred in 2018.
If you’re planning to visit places where yellow fever infection is found, you should seek travel health advice before you travel. A
map and list of countries where yellow fever is found
is available on the NHS Fit for Travel website.
How yellow fever is spread
The virus that causes yellow fever is passed to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. The mosquitoes that spread the infection are usually active and bite during daylight hours, and are found in both urban and rural areas.
Yellow fever can’t be passed directly from person to person through close contact.
Yellow fever symptoms
The symptoms of yellow fever occur in 2 stages. The initial symptoms develop 3 to 6 days after infection, and can include:
a high temperature (fever)
a
headache
nausea or vomiting
muscle pain, including backache
loss of appetite
This stage will usually pass after 3 to 4 days and most people will make a full recovery.
However, around 15% of people go on to develop more serious problems, including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach (causing blood in your vomit and stools).
Up to half of those who experience these symptoms will die.
When to seek medical advice
You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of yellow fever and are currently travelling in an area where the virus is found, or have recently returned from one of these areas.
To help determine whether you have yellow fever, the doctor will want to know exactly where you have been travelling and what symptoms you have. A
blood test
will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Treating yellow fever
There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but you will be monitored and the symptoms can be treated.
You will be admitted to hospital for assessment and supportive care.
Yellow fever vaccination
The yellow fever vaccine protects you from infection when you travel to a country where yellow fever virus occurs and prevents the disease from spreading between countries.
After you have received the vaccine you are given a yellow fever vaccine certificate to prove that you have received the vaccine and are protected from infection. This certificate is designed to fit inside your passport and is valid for life.
The countries that require proof of vaccination are those where either the disease occurs, or where it could occur because they have the correct mosquito and monkey species that could harbour the infection.

yellow fever vaccine

About venous leg ulcers
A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore that takes more than 4 to 6 weeks to heal. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle.
The
symptoms of a venous leg ulcer
include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge.
See your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it will need specialist treatment to help it heal.
Your GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions.

What causes venous leg ulcers?
A venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for over 90% of all cases.
Venous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, where persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has damaged the skin.
Read more about the
causes of venous leg ulcers
.
Who’s affected?
Venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age. It’s estimated that around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one.
You’re more at risk of developing one if you’ve previously had
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
or find it difficult to walk because of a problem such as:
osteoarthritis
a leg injury
obesity
paralysis
You’re also more at risk if you’ve recently had an operation on your leg, such as a
hip replacement
or
knee replacement
.
People with
varicose veins
(swollen and enlarged veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers.
How venous leg ulcers are treated
Most venous leg ulcers heal within 3 to 4 months if they’re treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. However, some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal.
Treatment usually involves:
cleaning and dressing the wound
using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs
Antibiotics
may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they don’t help ulcers to heal.
However, unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there’s a high risk of a venous leg ulcer recurring after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT, or varicose veins.

Can venous leg ulcers be prevented?
There are several ways to help prevent a venous leg ulcer in people at risk, such as:
wearing compression stockings
losing weight if you’re overweight
exercising regularly
elevating your leg when possible
This is particularly important if you’ve previously had a leg ulcer – once a leg has suffered a venous ulcer, you’re at risk of further ulcers developing within months or years.

Symptoms of venous leg ulcers
Venous leg ulcers are open, often painful, sores in the skin that take more than a month to heal. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle.
If you have a venous leg ulcer, you may also have:
swollen ankles (oedema)
discolouration and darkening of the skin around the ulcer
hardened skin around the ulcer, which may make your leg feel hard or even resemble the shape of an upside-down champagne bottle
a heavy feeling in your legs
aching or swelling in your legs
red, flaky, scaly and itchy skin on your legs (
varicose eczema
)
swollen and enlarged veins on your legs (
varicose veins
)
an unpleasant and foul-smelling discharge from the ulcer
Signs of an infection
A venous leg ulcer can be susceptible to bacterial infection. Symptoms of an infected leg ulcer can include:
worsening pain
a green or unpleasant discharge coming from the ulcer
redness and swelling of the skin around the ulcer
a high temperature (fever)
When to seek medical advice
Contact your GP if you think you’ve developed a venous leg ulcer. They’re unlikely to get better on their own, as they usually require specialist medical treatment.
You should also contact your GP or leg ulcer specialist if you’ve been diagnosed with a venous leg ulcer and have symptoms that suggest it could be infected.
Read more about
how venous leg ulcers are treated
.
Causes of venous leg ulcers
A venous leg ulcer can develop after a minor injury if there’s a problem with the circulation of blood in your leg veins. If this happens, pressure inside the veins increases.
This constant high pressure can gradually damage the tiny blood vessels in your skin and make it fragile. As a result, your skin can easily break and form an ulcer after a knock or scratch.
Unless you have treatment to improve the circulation in your legs, the ulcer may not heal.
Read more about
treating venous leg ulcers
.
Who’s most at risk?
A number of factors can increase your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer, including:
obesity
or being overweight – this increases the pressure in the leg veins
if you have difficulty walking – this can weaken the calf muscles, which can affect circulation in the leg veins
previous
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
– blood clots that develop in the leg can damage valves in the veins
varicose veins
– swollen and enlarged veins caused by malfunctioning valves
previous injury to the leg, such as a broken or fractured bone, which may cause DVT or impair walking
previous surgery to the leg, such as a
hip replacement
or
knee replacement
, which can prevent you from moving about
increasing age – people find it harder to move around as they get older, particularly if they suffer from arthritis
Diagnosing venous leg ulcers
See your GP if you think you have a venous leg ulcer. The ulcer is unlikely to heal without specialist treatment.
Diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and examination of your affected leg, although additional tests may be required.
Medical history and examination
Your GP or practice nurse will ask whether you have any other symptoms associated with venous leg ulcers, such as:
swelling in your ankles
discoloured or hard skin
They’ll try to determine the cause of the ulcer by asking about underlying conditions or previous injuries, such as:
diabetes
deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
injury or surgery in the affected leg
a previous leg ulcer
They’ll also examine your leg, both when you’re standing up and lying down.
Varicose veins
will be more obvious when you’re standing up, and it will be easier to look at the ulcer when you’re lying down.
They’ll also feel your pulse at your ankles to make sure the arteries in your leg are working properly.
Doppler study
To rule out peripheral arterial disease (a condition affecting the arteries) as a possible cause of your symptoms, your GP or nurse will carry out a test known as a Doppler study.
This involves measuring the blood pressure in the arteries at your ankles and comparing it to the pressure in your arms. If you have peripheral arterial disease, the blood pressure in your ankles will be lower than your arms.
It’s important to carry out this check as the main treatment for venous ulcers is compression bandages or stockings to improve the vein circulation in your legs. It’s not safe to apply compression if the ankle artery pressures are low.
Read more about
how venous leg ulcers are treated
.
Referral to a specialist
In some cases, your GP or nurse may decide to refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist).
For example, you may be referred to a vascular specialist if your GP or nurse is unsure about your diagnosis, or if they suspect your ulcer may be caused by artery diseases, diabetes or
rheumatoid arthritis
.
After taking your medical history and examining you, the vascular specialist may need to arrange further investigations to plan your treatment.
Treating venous leg ulcers
With appropriate treatment, most venous leg ulcers heal within 3 to 4 months.
Treatment should always be carried out by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. Usually, this will be a practice or district nurse.
Cleaning and dressing the ulcer
The first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. This provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal.
A simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. This usually needs to be changed once a week. Many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse.
Compression
To improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. These bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.
There are many different types of bandage or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which may be made in 2, 3 or 4 different layers. The application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff.
The bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed.
When compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it’s usually painful. Ideally, you should have
paracetamol
or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your GP. The pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days.
It’s important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. If you have any problems, it’s usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. If the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help.
However, you’ll need to cut the bandage off if:
you get severe pain at the front of your ankle
you get severe pain on the top of your foot
your toes become blue and swollen
Once you remove the bandage, make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.
In some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages, such as special stockings or other compressive devices. These may not be available in every clinic but could change the way ulcers are treated in future. Your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you.
Treating associated symptoms
Swelling in the legs and ankles
Venous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. This can be controlled by compression bandages.
Keeping your leg elevated whenever possible, ideally with your toes at the same level as your eyes, will also help ease swelling. You should put a suitcase, sofa cushion or foam wedge under the bottom of your mattress, to help keep your legs raised while you sleep.
You should also keep as active as possible and aim to continue with your normal activities. Regular exercise, such as a daily walk, will help reduce leg swelling. However, you should avoid standing or sitting still with your feet down. You should elevate your feet at least every hour.
Itchy skin
Some people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin.
This is often due to
varicose eczema
, which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient) and occasionally a mild
corticosteroid
cream or ointment. In rare cases, you may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment.
Itchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. If this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies.
It’s important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy, because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers.
Looking after yourself during treatment
To help your ulcer heal more quickly, follow the advice below:
Try to keep active by walking regularly. Sitting and standing still without elevating your legs can make venous leg ulcers and swelling worse
Whenever you’re sitting or lying down, keep your affected leg elevated – with your toes level with your eyes
Regularly exercise your legs by moving your feet up and down, and rotating them at the ankles. This can help encourage better circulation
If you’re overweight, try to reduce your weight with a
healthy diet
and regular exercise
Stop smoking
Moderate your alcohol consumption
Be careful not to injure your affected leg, and wear comfortable, well-fitting footwear
You may also find it helpful to attend a local healthy leg club, such as those provided by the
Lindsay Leg Club Foundation
, for support and advice.
Treating an infected ulcer
An ulcer sometimes produces a large amount of discharge and becomes more painful. There may also be redness around the ulcer. These symptoms and feeling unwell are signs of infection.
If your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual.
You should also elevate your leg most of the time and you’ll be prescribed a 7-day course of
antibiotics
.
The aim of antibiotic treatment is to clear the infection. However, antibiotics don’t heal ulcers and should only be used in short courses to treat infected ulcers.
Follow-up
You should visit your nurse once a week to have your dressings and compression bandages changed. They’ll also monitor the ulcer to see how well it’s healing. Once your ulcer is healing well, your nurse will see you less often.
After the ulcer has healed
Once you’ve had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop within months or years.
The most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you’re out of bed. Your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself.
Various accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off.

Preventing venous leg ulcers
You can help reduce your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer in several ways, such as wearing a compression stocking, losing weight and taking care of your skin.
People most at risk of developing a venous leg ulcer are those who have previously had a leg ulcer.
Compression stockings
If you’ve previously had a venous leg ulcer, or you’re at risk of developing one, treatment with compression stockings may be recommended by your GP.
These stockings are specially designed to squeeze your legs, improving your circulation. They’re usually tightest at the ankle and less tight further up your leg – this encourages blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.
To be most effective, these stockings should be put on as soon as you get up and only taken off at night.
Compression stockings are available in a variety of sizes, colours, styles and pressures. A nurse can help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. There are various accessories you can buy to help get the stockings on and off.
Losing weight
If you’re
obese
or overweight, losing weight can help treat and prevent venous leg ulcers. Excess weight leads to high pressure in the veins in your legs, which can damage your skin. Venous ulcers are much more common among people who are overweight.
To help you lose weight, regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet are recommended. You should also avoid sitting or standing for long periods. Elevating your legs whenever possible can also help.

Treating underlying problems
Treating severe
varicose veins
may help prevent leg swelling or ulcers. This may involve a procedure where a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into the affected veins with high-frequency radio waves or lasers used to seal them.
Alternatively, you may need surgery to repair the damage to your leg veins, or to remove the affected veins altogether.

Warts are small lumps that often develop on the skin of the hands and feet. They vary in appearance and may develop singly or in clusters.
Most people will have warts at some point in their life. They tend to affect children and teenagers more than adults.
Warts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV).

Cause of warts and verrucas
Warts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV).
There are lots of different strains of HPV and these cause different types of warts.
HPV causes too much keratin (a hard protein) to develop in the top skin layer (epidermis). The extra keratin produces the rough, hard texture of a wart.
How warts spread
HPV is passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. It can also be passed on indirectly by contact with contaminated objects like:
towels
shoes
areas surrounding swimming pools
the floors of communal changing areas
You’re more likely to get infected if your skin is wet or damaged.
Warts can also be spread to other parts of your own body. You can spread the virus if you:
scratch, knock or bite a wart
bite your nails or suck your fingers (if they have warts on them)
shave your face or legs
After you become infected, it can take weeks or even months for a wart or verruca to appear.
When to get help
Warts and verrucas aren’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist.
Your pharmacist will give you advice about the best treatment for you.
Find your nearest pharmacy
Speak to a GP if you have a:
growth on your skin that you’re worried about
wart or verruca that keeps coming back
wart or verruca that’s very large or painful
wart that bleeds
wart that changes in how it looks
wart on your face or genitals
Types of wart
There are several different types of warts. These vary in size and shape.
Common warts (verruca vulgaris)
If you have a common wart, it will:
be round or oval-shaped
be firm and raised
have a rough, irregular surface
often develop on the knuckles, fingers and knees
vary in size, from less than 1mm to more than 10mm (1cm) in diameter
You may develop one common wart or several.
Filiform warts (verruca filiformis)
Source:
dermnetnz.org
Filiform warts are long and slender in appearance. They often develop on the neck or face.
Mosaic warts
Mosaic warts grow in clusters and form a ’tile-like’ pattern. They often develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
Periungual warts
Source:
dermnetnz.org
Periungual warts develop under and around the fingernails or toenails. They:
have a rough surface
can affect the shape of the nail
can be painful
Plane warts
Source:
dermnetnz.org
It’s possible to have between one and several hundred plane warts, which can develop in clusters. They are usually:
a yellowish colour
smooth, round and flat-topped
2 to 4mm in diameter
common in young children – mainly affecting the hands, face and legs
Plane warts can sometimes develop on the lower legs of women. This is because the human papilloma virus (HPV) can be spread through shaving.
Verrucas (plantar warts)
Verrucas usually develop on the soles of the feet. The affected area of skin will be:
white, often with a black dot (blood vessel) in the centre
flat rather than raised
Verrucas can sometimes be painful if they’re on a weight-bearing part of the foot.
Treating warts and verrucas
Warts usually clear up without treatment.
The length of time it takes for a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. It can take up to 2 years for the virus to leave your system and for warts to disappear. Warts tend to last longer in older children and adults.
Leaving the wart to go away by itself is one option. But, you may want to consider treatment if your wart is:
painful
in an awkward position
causing you distress or embarrassment
A wart will sometimes return following treatment.
Types of treatment
Common ways to treat warts and verrucas include:
salicylic acid – available from pharmacies in creams, gels, paints and medicated plasters
cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is applied to the wart to freeze and destroy affected skin cells
chemical treatments – chemicals are applied to warts to kill affected skin cells
Surgery is not usually recommended for warts.
Preventing warts and verrucas
There are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting warts, and prevent them spreading to others.
Do
keep your feet dry
change your socks every day
take care when shaving – the virus can be spread easily if you cut yourself
wear gloves when using shared gym equipment if you have a wart on your hand
wear pool slippers or flip flops in communal changing rooms and showers
cover the wart or verruca with a waterproof plaster or a verruca sock when swimming or while doing PE at school
Don’t
do not touch other people’s warts
do not share towels, flannels or other personal items with someone who has a wart
do not share shoes or socks with someone who has a verruca
do not scratch or pick a wart or verruca – it’ll encourage the HPV to spread to other parts of your body"
https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/tooth-decay/,"Tooth decay
If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always
phone the dental practice that you normally attend
.
If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should
read our advice on dental emergencies
.
Tooth decay can occur when acid is produced from plaque, which builds up on your teeth.
If plaque is allowed to build up, it can lead to further problems, such as dental caries (holes in the teeth),
gum disease
or
dental abscesses
, which are collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums.
Symptoms of tooth decay
Tooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have:
toothache
– either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause
tooth sensitivity – you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet
grey, brown or black spots appearing on your teeth
bad breath
an unpleasant taste in your mouth
Seeing a dentist
Visit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin. Tooth decay is much easier and cheaper to treat in its early stages. Dentists can usually identify tooth decay and further problems with a simple examination or
X-ray
.
Find your nearest dentist
It’s also important to have regular
dental check-ups
. Adults should have a check-up at least once every 2 years and children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year.
Read more on
getting over a fear of the dentist
Treatments for tooth decay
Treatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is.
For early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a
fluoride
gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.
Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. This involves removing the dental decay, offering
local anaesthetic
to numb the tooth and filling the hole.
If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.
If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial
denture
, bridge or implant.
Cost of NHS treatment
NHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April.
Some people don’t have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women and new mothers. Financial help may also be available to those on a low income.
The cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment.
Preventing tooth decay
Although tooth decay is a common problem, it’s often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should:
visit your dentist regularly – your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums
cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed – some medications can also contain sugar, so it’s best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible
look after your teeth and gums – brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day
avoid
smoking
or
drinking alcohol
excessively – tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean, and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel
see your dentist or GP if you have a persistently
dry mouth
– this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions
Read:
how to keep your teeth clean
reading food labels
Protecting your child’s teeth
Establishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged.
It’s important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist can show you how to do this. Younger children should use a children’s toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it.
Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.
How plaque causes tooth decay
Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.
When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.
If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.
Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.
Without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.
The bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of
abscess

https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/whooping-cough/,"Whooping cough
Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways.
It causes repeated coughing bouts that can last for 2 to 3 months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill.
Whooping cough is spread in the droplets of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection.
Symptoms of whooping cough
The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a
cold
, such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature.
Intense coughing bouts start about a week later.
The bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night.
Coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting.
Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath – this may cause a ‘whoop’ sound, although not everyone has this.
The strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes.
Young children can sometimes briefly turn blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing – this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should start again quickly.
In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing.
The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely.
Who’s at risk of whooping cough
Whooping cough can affect people of any age, including:
babies and young children – young babies under 6 months of age are at a particularly increased risk of complications of whooping cough
older children and adults – it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and frustrating
people who’ve had whooping cough before – you’re not immune to whooping cough if you’ve had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around
people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child – protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years
You can get whooping cough if you come into close contact with someone with the infection.
A person with whooping cough is infectious from about 6 days after they were infected – when they just have cold-like symptoms – until three weeks after the coughing bouts start.
Antibiotic treatment can reduce the length of time someone is infectious.
When to get medical advice
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
You or your child:
have significant breathing difficulties, such as long periods of breathlessness or choking, shallow breathing, periods where breathing stops, or dusky, blue skin
develop signs of serious complications of whooping cough, such as fits (seizures) or
pneumonia
Speak to your GP practice or phone 111 if:
You or your child:
have symptoms of whooping cough
have had a cough for more than 3 weeks
have a cough that is particularly severe or is getting worse
Treatment for whooping cough
Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you’ve had the infection.
Children under 6 months who are very ill and people with severe symptoms will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment.
People diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of infection may be prescribed
antibiotics
to take at home. These will help stop the infection spreading to others, but may not reduce the symptoms.
People who’ve had whooping cough for more than 3 weeks won’t normally need any specific treatment, as they’re no longer contagious and antibiotics are unlikely to help.
While you’re recovering at home, it can help to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, clean away mucus and sick from your or your child’s mouth, and take painkillers such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
for a fever.
Avoid using cough medicines, as they’re not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help.
Stopping the infection spreading
If you or your child are taking antibiotics for whooping cough, you need to be careful not to spread the infection to others.
Do
stay away from nursery, school or work until 2 days after the start of antibiotic treatment or, if not taking antibiotics 3 weeks from when the coughing bouts started
cover your or your child’s mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing
dispose of used tissues immediately
wash your and your child’s hands regularly with soap and water
Other members of your household may also be given antibiotics and a dose of the whooping cough vaccine to stop them becoming infected.
Vaccinations for whooping cough
There are 3 routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough:
the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy – this can protect your baby during the first few weeks of life; the best time to have it is soon after the 16th week of your pregnancy
the 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age
the 4-in-1 pre-school booster – offered to children by 3 years and 4 months
These vaccines don’t offer lifelong protection from whooping cough, but they can help stop children getting it when they’re young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection.
Older children and adults aren’t routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak.
Complications of whooping cough
Babies and young children under 6 months are usually most severely affected by whooping cough.
They’re at an increased risk of:
dehydration
breathing difficulties
weight loss
pneumonia
– an infection of the lungs
fits (seizures)
kidney problems
brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen reaching the brain
death – although this is very rare
Older children and adults tend to be less severely affected, although they may experience problems caused by repeated coughing, such as
nosebleeds
, bruised ribs or a hernia."

Cancer of the womb (uterus) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. It’s also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer.
Abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer.
If you have been through the

The vast majority of womb cancers begin in the cells that make up the lining of the womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb is often called endometrial cancer.
In rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer.
This article uses the term womb cancer, and mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. Read more

.
Womb cancer is separate from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as
ovarian cancer
and
cervical cancer
.
Why does womb cancer happen?
It’s not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.
A hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body.
A number of things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
. There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.
It’s not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of
contraception
.

How is womb cancer treated?
The most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).
A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.
Radiotherapy
or
chemotherapy
are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery.
A type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.
Even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.

Living with womb cancer
Living with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways.
For example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive.
You may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer.

Who is affected?
Womb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It’s the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in women after
breast cancer
,
lung cancer
, and
cancer of the colon and rectum
.
Womb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. Most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.
Symptoms of womb cancer
The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer.
Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the
menopause
, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.
In women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:
periods that are heavier than usual
vaginal bleeding in between normal periods
Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.
If womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:
pain in the back, legs, or pelvis
loss of appetite
tiredness
nausea
When to seek medical advice
If you have postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP.
Only 1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by womb cancer, so it’s unlikely your symptoms will be caused by this condition.
However, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it’s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated. The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:
endometriosis
– where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb
fibroids
– non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus
polyps in the womb lining
Other types of gynaecological cancer can also cause unusual vaginal bleeding, particularly
cervical cancer
.

Causes of womb cancer
It’s not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it.
Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.
If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.
Increased risk
A number of things have been identified that increase the risk of developing womb cancer.
Age
The risk of developing womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases occur in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.
Oestrogen
The risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body’s exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system.
oestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the womb lining to divide
progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries
The levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn’t kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen.
After the
menopause
, the body stops producing progesterone. However, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. This unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which can increase the risk of womb cancer.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
Because of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and womb cancer, oestrogen-only
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
should only be given to those who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy).
In all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer.
Being overweight or obese
As oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer.
Women and anyone with a womb who is overweight is 3 times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with those who are a healthy weight.
One way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand
your healthy body mass index (BMI)
.
Reproductive history
Women and anyone with a womb who has not had children are at a higher risk of womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during pregnancy have a protective effect on the lining of the womb.
Tamoxifen
Women and anyone with a womb who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment for
breast cancer
) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer.
It’s important to visit your GP if you’re taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding.
Diabetes
Women and anyone with a womb with
diabetes
are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as those without the condition.
Diabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels.
Many women and anyone with ovaries with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
Women and anyone with ovaries with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies.
PCOS can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).
Endometrial hyperplasia
Endometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. It may be increase risk of developing womb cancer.

Diagnosing womb cancer
You should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure.
Your GP will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. They will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often.
You may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests.
In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (
NICE
) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on
Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral
.
Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU)
Another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of
ultrasound scan
that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe.
This is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful.
The TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.
Biopsy
If the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a
biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis.
In a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.
The biopsy can be carried out in several ways, including:
aspiration biopsy – a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells
hysteroscopy – this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it
In some cases, a
hysteroscopy
may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&C). D&C is a minor surgical procedure carried out under
general anaesthetic
, where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.
Blood test
A
blood test
can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test.
However, this type of test isn’t very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn’t mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don’t have these chemicals in their blood.

Tests if you have womb cancer
If you’re diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests to help determine the stage of the cancer. Staging the cancer will allow the doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you.
These tests may include:
a chest
X-ray
– where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
– where magnetic fields are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread
a
computerised tomography (CT) scan
– where a series of X-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread
further blood tests – these are usually done to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning
Read treating womb cancer
for more information about staging.
Treating womb cancer
Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are:
stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus)
stage 2 – the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix)
stage 3 – the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes
stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs
Your chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it’s diagnosed.

Treatment overview
The main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer.
Treatment if you haven’t been through the menopause
Having a hysterectomy means you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven’t already reached the
menopause
may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children.
In this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.
Treating advanced cancer
Advanced womb cancer requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy.
Advanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.
Even if there’s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible.
Radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth.

Surgery
Surgery for stage 1 womb cancer
If you have stage 1 cancer, you’ll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as the uterus (hysterectomy).
The surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread.
The most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it.
It’s sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments can be used.
This means the surgeon can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring.
You’ll probably be ready to go home 3 to 5 days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully.
After your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You’ll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications.
When you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you.
Surgery for stage 2 or 3 womb cancer
If you have stage 2 or 3 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy.
This involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
Surgery for advanced cancer (stage 4)
If you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery.
This won’t cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. Your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you.

laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer
Radiotherapy
A course of
radiotherapy
will be recommended if your treatment team thinks there’s a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. Radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible.
There are 2 types of radiotherapy used to treat womb cancer:
internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy) – where a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb
external radiotherapy – where a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis
A course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5 days a week with a break at the weekend. The treatment takes a few minutes. The whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4 weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer.
Some women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina.
There are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. With low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. You’ll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you.
Radiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and
diarrhoea
.
As your course of treatment progresses, you’re likely to get very tired. Most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes.
Chemotherapy
If you have stage 3 or 4 womb cancer, you may be given a course of
chemotherapy
. Chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. In cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms.
Chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You’ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital.
Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover.
Side effects of chemotherapy can include:
nausea
vomiting
hair loss
fatigue
There is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream
(sepsis)
, as your body’s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.
The side effects should stop once treatment has finished.

Hormone therapy
Some womb cancers are affected by the female hormone oestrogen. These cancers may respond to treatment with hormone therapy. Your doctor will discuss whether this is a possible treatment for your womb cancer.
Hormone therapy usually replaces a hormone called progesterone, which naturally occurs in your body. Artificial progesterone is used and is usually given as tablets.
It’s mainly used to treat advanced-stage womb cancers, or cancer that has come back, and can help shrink the tumour and control any symptoms.
The treatment may have some side effects, including mild nausea, mild muscle cramps, and weight gain. Your doctor will discuss these with you.

Clinical trials
A lot of progress has been made in the treatment of womb cancer. More people are living longer with fewer side effects. Some of these advances were discovered through clinical trials, where new treatments and combinations of treatments are compared with standard treatment.
All cancer clinical trials in the UK are carefully monitored to make sure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials often do better overall than those in routine care.
If you’re invited to take part in a trial, you’ll be given an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you’ll be asked to sign your consent. You’re always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Living with womb cancer
Women and anyone with a womb with womb cancer usually have a hysterectomy. This can be a major operation, and recovery may take from 6 to 12 weeks.
During this time you will have to avoid lifting things (for example, children and heavy shopping bags) and doing heavy housework. You won’t be able to drive for between 3 and 8 weeks after the operation.
Most people need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. The recovery time will depend on the type of surgery you have, whether or not any problems develop, and what type of work you will return to.
Some of the treatments for endometrial cancer, particularly radiotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.
Follow-up
After your course of treatment has finished, you’ll probably be invited back for regular check-ups. At the check-up, your doctor will examine you (this is likely to include an internal examination) and possibly carry out blood tests or scans to see how your cancer is responding to treatment.

Relationships and sex
Relationships with friends and family
Knowing how to talk to your friends and family about your cancer can be difficult, and they may find it hard to talk to you, too. People deal with serious problems in different ways.
It’s hard to predict how a diagnosis of cancer will affect you. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. But don’t feel shy about telling people that you want some time to yourself, if that’s what you need.

Your sex life
Womb cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. This can happen in several ways.
If you haven’t already had the menopause, removing the ovaries means you’ll go through an early menopause. Symptoms can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.
Radiotherapy for endometrial cancer can make your vagina narrower and less flexible. Sometimes the vagina gets so narrow that having sex becomes difficult. To stop this happening, you should be offered a set of vaginal dilators, which are plastic cones you put into your vagina to stretch it. You can also stretch your vagina by having sex, or by using your fingers or a vibrator.
It’s common to lose interest in sex after treatment for womb cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer, and you also may be grieving the loss of your fertility.
It’s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while having to cope with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you feel you have problems with sex that aren’t getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or a sex therapist.

Talk to others
Being diagnosed with cancer can be hard, both for patients and their families. You’ll need to deal with the emotional and practical difficulties.
With womb cancer, you have to cope physically with recovering from a hysterectomy, as well as the possible emotional impact of losing your womb.
Younger women may have to face the fact they won’t be able to have children and all the grief and anger that may cause.
Often, it can help to discuss your feelings and other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support:
your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor
if you’re struggling with feelings of depression, talk to your GP – a course of
antidepressant drugs
may be helpful, or your GP can arrange for you to get help from a counsellor or psychotherapist
it may be helpful to talk to someone who’s had the same experience as you – many organisations have telephone helplines and forums that may be useful to you, and they can put you in touch with other people who have been through cancer treatment
