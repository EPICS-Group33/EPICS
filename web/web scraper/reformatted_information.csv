Read more about the complications of AML Seeking medical advice If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they’ll arrange blood tests pale skin tiredness breathlessness a high temperature (fever) excessive sweating weight loss frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds easily bruised skin flat red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae) bone and joint pain a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen headaches , fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness. When to seek medical advice . Increased risk It’s not known what triggers the genetic mutation in AML, although a number of different factors that can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified. The main risk factors for AML are outlined below. Radiation exposure Being exposed to a significant level of radiation can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945. In the UK, most people are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML. However, some people who have had radiotherapy consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body The medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis. All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA) If you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you’ll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy. Side effects of ATRA can include headaches , nausea, bone pain, and dry mouth , skin and eyes. Consolidation a high temperature (fever) a headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness Bleeding If you have AML, you’ll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive. People with advanced AML are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition. Serious bleeding can occur: All these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring. Infertility ","Diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia AML occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells. Blast cells don’t have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). It’s not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there’s no identifiable cause. However, a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy Who’s affected AML is a rare type of cancer. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It’s most common in people over 65. How AML is treated Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells. The white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don’t have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as ‘blast cells’. ","Chemotherapy local anaesthetic . The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together. You won’t feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. The bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have. Further tests Additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below. Genetic testing As AML is a complex condition, it’s usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) – a group of different specialists working together. ","Complications of acute myeloid leukaemia About acute myeloid leukaemia Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are: lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Read more about diagnosing AML exposure to benzene – a chemical used in manufacturing that’s also found in cigarette smoke having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down’s syndrome Read more about the In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant , to achieve a cure. Read more about Benzene and smoking Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it’s also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. Benzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML. chemotherapy medications for an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later. Blood disorders People with certain blood disorders – such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or polycythaemia vera (PCV) – have an increased risk of developing AML. Genetic disorders People with certain genetic disorders, including Down’s syndrome and Fanconi’s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia. Other suggested triggers A number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there’s no clear evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML. Diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia In the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have blood tests . A haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page. Bone marrow biopsy For example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA). Scans If you have AML, a computerised tomography (CT) scan , X-ray or echocardiogram (an ultrasound scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. Lumbar puncture In rare situations where it’s thought there’s a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells. If you’re thought to have a high risk of experiencing Induction chemotherapy Intensive chemotherapy If you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you’ll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow. You’ll have regular blood transfusions because your blood won’t contain enough healthy blood cells. You’ll also be vulnerable to infection, so it’s important that you’re in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent further infection. In very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that’s placed into your spine, in a similar way to a lumbar puncture . Side effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include: nausea vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite sore mouth and mouth ulcers (mucositis) tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility – which may be temporary or permanent (see complications of AML for more information) Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy Non-intensive chemotherapy Radiotherapy Radiotherapy involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are 2 main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML: to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon Side effects of radiotherapy can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. Bone marrow and stem cell transplants bone marrow or stem cell transplant . Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication. This process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type. Transplantations are most successful when they’re carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there’s a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. Read about bone marrow donation Azacitidine It’s recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in certain circumstances – for example, depending on the characteristics of the person’s blood and bone marrow. Azacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that’s given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells. NICE has more information about clinical trials for AML . Your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved. Complications of acute myeloid leukaemia Weakened immune system Having a weakened immune system – being immunocompromised – is a common complication of AML. Therefore, you may be advised to: take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections maintain good personal and dental hygiene avoid contact with anyone who’s known to have an infection – even if it’s a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles check with your GP to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although you won’t be able to have any vaccine that contains ‘live’ viruses or bacteria, such as the shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) infertility . This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent. People who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant . ",
Acute myeloid leukaemia: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/acute-myeloid-leukaemia-children/,Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML can affect children of any age. Girls and boys are equally affected ,"As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. Sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells. A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands. How AML is diagnosed ","Down’s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child’s risk of developing AML. AML, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people. ",,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Leukaemia Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body. Bone marrow contains: red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding white blood cells, which help to fight infection There are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature. These immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection. There are 4 main types of leukaemia: acute lymphoblastic (ALL) acute myeloid (AML) chronic lymphocytic (CLL) chronic myeloid (CML) This page is about acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) Acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells). Cells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. Cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated. There are several classification systems for the sub-types of AML. The most commonly used system in the UK is the French-American-British (FAB) system. FAB classification of AML M0 – AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation M1 – AML without maturation M2 – AML with maturation M3 – Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) M4 – Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia M5 – Acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia M6 – Acute erythroleukaemia M7 – Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia A newer system known as the WHO (World Health Organization) classification system is also sometimes used. Induction Bone marrow transplant side effects Some of the main side effects are: hair loss reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection) loss of appetite and weight feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) Most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about side effects. A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way the heart works, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer in later life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-teenagers-and-young-adults/acute-lymphoblastic-leukaemia-teenagers-and-young-adults/,"Introduction Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow Tests for ALL ","looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) bruises – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection aches and pains in your bones swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin feeling unwell and run down fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection headaches and visual disturbance tests they think you might need. Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow To understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow. Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs. There are 3 main types of blood cells: white blood cells – which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding The bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature). The main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells. Once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed. How leukaemia develops In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made. They build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets. Types of leukaemia Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from two types of blood cells: lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils Leukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL: acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts There are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people. The information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contact Macmillan . We also have more information about: having tests for ALL being treated for ALL If you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read our general ALL section. Tests for ALL Visiting your GP This specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood problems. At the hospital blood tests being treated for ALL leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow If you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read our general ALL section. ","Young people with some genetic conditions, such as Down’s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with. If you’re worried about ALL ",,"Introduction This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia. If you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, please see our general ALL section. Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to: help fight infection (white cells) carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells) stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets) bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells chest X-ray – this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest If you have ALL, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, or an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart). Waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a Macmillan cancer support specialist on their free helpline. We also have more information about: chemotherapy . This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You’ll also have drugs called steroids , which help the chemotherapy to work. ALL is treated in 3 phases: getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy keeping the leukaemia away long-term – continuing or maintenance therapy You usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have ALL. You’ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). You’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can’t hide there. This is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy. It’s also known as intrathecal therapy. There will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings. We have more information about chemotherapy that has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults. Getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction) chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including CNS therapy) steroids to help the chemotherapy work drugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once another tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcers vincristine asparaginase daunorubicin mercaptopurine methotrexate Side effects Different chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s chemotherapy section . Central nervous system therapy It’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there. The chemotherapy drug used for CNS therapy is called methotrexate. Side effects Most people don’t have side effects after having intrathecal methotrexate. But occasionally it can cause headaches, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours. Rarely other side effects like seizures (fits), weakness of your arms or legs and changes in how awake you are can happen. But these almost always go away completely and you can still have the intrathecal injections in the future. Keeping leukaemia away You’ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. This is so the leukaemia cells don’t have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance). Drugs you may be given include: cyclophosphamide cytarabine (ara-C) mercaptopurine methotrexate vincristine asparaginase doxorubicin Side effects Chemotherapy does cause side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s chemotherapy section . Keeping the leukaemia away long term (maintenance therapy) Maintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles. You’ll have: mercaptopurine tablets each day methotrexate tablets once a week steroid tablets for 5 days every 4 weeks vincristine chemotherapy every 4 weeks methotrexate chemotherapy into your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) every 12 weeks At the moment, boys have just over 3 years of maintenance therapy and girls have just over 2 years. This is because it takes a bit longer in boys to get rid of any remaining leukaemia cells. During this time, you’ll have regular check-ups – usually every week or two – to check if your drug doses need to be adjusted and to make sure you’re OK. Very often, things like blood tests can be done at your GP practice or at home by a district nurse. Ask your doctor or nurse about arranging this. ",
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/,About abdominal aortic aneurysms ,"An AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture). A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery. The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen. If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Read more about the . The screening test is an ultrasound scan , which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one. Read more about diagnosing an AAA . a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that’s usually only noticeable when you touch it persistent back pain persistent abdominal pain Ruptured AAA If your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. In men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum. dizziness sweaty and clammy skin rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) shortness of breath feeling faint loss of consciousness Medical emergency A ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it’s important to get to hospital as soon as possible. Around 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don’t survive emergency surgery. This is why the NHS AAA Screening Programme was introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst. If you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. ","Diagnosing an abdominal aortic aneurysm AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group. This is why all men are invited for a screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan , which takes around 10-15 minutes. There are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level. Having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself. Read more about the . Diagnosing an AAA The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm. The abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide – about the width of a garden hosepipe  – but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm. Risk factors for an AAA One study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than people under 55 years old. Men are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than women. However, there are other risk factors that you can do something about – described below – the most important of which is smoking. Smoking Research has found that smokers are seven times more likely to develop an AAA than people who have never smoked. The more you smoke, the greater your risk of developing an AAA. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers. The risk may increase because tobacco smoke contains harmful substances that can damage and weaken the wall of the aorta. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, such as cholesterol. An AAA is thought to develop because these deposits (called plaques) cause the aorta to widen in an attempt to keep blood flowing through it. As it widens, it also gets weaker. Smoking, eating a high-fat diet and high blood pressure all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis. High blood pressure As well as contributing to atherosclerosis, high blood pressure (hypertension) can place increased pressure on the aorta’s wall. Family history Having a family history of AAAs means that you have an increased risk of developing one. One study found that people who had a brother or sister with an AAA were eight times more likely to develop one than people whose siblings were unaffected. This suggests that certain genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing an AAA. However, no specific genes have yet been identified. Read about how to reduce your risk of developing an AAA . Diagnosing an abdominal aortic aneurysm Tobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries. It is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an AAA. The more you smoke, the greater your risk. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers. If you want to stop smoking, your GP will be able to refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit. You can also call or chat online with Quit Your Way Scotland . The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement. Read more about stopping smoking and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) , which can make it easier to quit. Diet Eating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis. It’s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon. This is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls. Read more about high cholesterol . Find out more about healthy eating and how to reduce the amount of saturated fat you eat . Exercise Being active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. Regular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure. Adults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. Examples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking. For it to count, the activity should make you feel warm and slightly out of breath. Someone who is overweight may only have to walk up a slope to get this feeling. Physical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening. Get more ideas on being active . Weight Being overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. This can raise your blood pressure, which in turn puts pressure on your arteries. Use a BMI healthy weight calculator to find out if you need to lose weight. If you need to shed some weight, it’s worth remembering that losing just a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health. Get tips on losing weight safely and read more about preventing high blood pressure . ","Screening All men in the UK who are 65 or over are offered an ultrasound scan to check for AAAs. All men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. Men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting their local NHS AAA screening service .

","Preventing an abdominal aortic aneurysm About abdominal aortic aneurysms An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body. The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large AAA. This is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing. They include medications to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure , and quitting smoking . You will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning. Read more about . In general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing. This is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired. If you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size. You will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing – for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level. If you have a large AAA If you are diagnosed with an AAA that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation. If it’s decided that surgery isn’t suitable for you, it’s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size – in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated. There are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm: endovascular surgery open surgery Although both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable. Endovascular surgery Endovascular surgery is a type of “keyhole” surgery where the surgeon makes small cuts in your groin. A small piece of tubing called a graft– made of metal mesh lined with fabric – is then guided up through the leg artery, into the swollen section of aorta, and sealed to the wall of the aorta at both ends. This reinforces the aorta, reducing the risk of it bursting. This is the safest of the two types of surgery available. Around 98-99% of patients make a full recovery, and recovery time from the operation is shorter than if you have open surgery. There are also fewer major complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the way the graft is attached is not as secure as open surgery. You’ll need regular scans to make sure the graft hasn’t slipped, and in some patients, the seal at each end of the graft starts to leak and will need to be resealed. You will need to have surgery again if either of these occurs. Open surgery In open surgery, the surgeon cuts into your stomach (abdomen) to reach the abdominal aorta and replaces the enlarged section with a graft. This type of graft is a tube made of a synthetic material. Because the graft is stitched (sutured) into place by the surgeon, it’s more likely to stay in place, and will usually work well for the rest of your life. The risk of complications linked to the graft after surgery is lower than in people who have endovascular surgery. Open surgery isn’t usually recommended for people who are in poor health as it is a major operation. It is slightly more risky than endovascular surgery, with 93-97% of patients making a full recovery. The main risk of open surgery is death or heart attack, and recovery time is longer than with endovascular surgery. There is also a greater risk of complications, such as wound infection, chest infection and DVT. If you have a small or medium AAA If you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won’t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it’s unlikely you’d benefit from surgery. You’ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger – every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm. You will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including: stopping smoking eating a balanced diet ensuring you maintain a healthy weight taking regular exercise If you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. Aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers. Read more about stopping smoking and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) that can make it easier to stop smoking. Your GP will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have: high blood pressure – which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor high cholesterol – which you will probably be treated for with a medication called a statin The decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation. Preventing an abdominal aortic aneurysm The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels. This includes: smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obese If your GP finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. This will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Acne,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/acne/,About acne ,"Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse Don’t try to “clean out” blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin) Completely remove make-up before going to bed If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient Regular exercise can’t improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25. Further information You can find support and information from organisations like: Changing Faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice polycystic ovary syndrome – a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary Other triggers Other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include: some cosmetic products – however, this is less common as most products are now tested, so they don’t cause spots (non-comedogenic) certain medications – such as steroid medications , lithium (used to treat depression and bipolar disorder ) and some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat epilepsy ) regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as a headband or backpack smoking – which can contribute to acne in older people Acne myths Despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood. There are many myths and misconceptions about it: “Acne is caused by a poor diet” So far, research hasn’t found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it’s good for your heart and your health in general. “Acne is caused by having dirty skin and poor hygiene” Most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so the cleanliness of your skin has no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin. “Squeezing blackheads, whiteheads and spots is the best way to get rid of acne” “Sexual activity can influence acne” Having sex or masturbating won’t make acne any better or worse. There’s no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer. “Acne is infectious” You can’t pass acne on to other people. Diagnosing acne Your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules. excessive body hair (hirsutism) irregular or light periods The most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of ultrasound scans and blood tests . ","Diagnosing acne Acne most commonly develops on the: face – this affects almost everyone with acne back – this affects more than half of people with acne chest – this affects about 15% of people with acne Types of spots There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they’re not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won’t empty when squeezed papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they’re large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring Papules are small red bumps that may feel tender or sore. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Blackheads are small black or yellow lumps that form on the skin. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ What can I do if I have acne? The self-help techniques below may be useful: The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn’t help to remove this blockage. Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There’s no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. Read more about the , including some common acne myths. Who’s affected? Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Acne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked. Sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of. Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum. In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle. If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead. Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts. Testosterone Teenage acne is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls. The sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones. It’s thought that increased levels of testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs. Acne in families Acne can run in families. If your parents had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also develop it. One study has found that if both your parents had acne, you’re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you’re more likely to get adult acne too. Acne in women More than 80% of cases of adult acne occur in women. It’s thought that many cases of adult acne are caused by the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times. These times include: periods – some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period pregnancy ",,"Complications of acne About acne When to get professional advice Search for a pharmacy near you Acne isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics If you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your GP to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Why do I have acne? Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). 4 grades can be used to measure the severity of acne: grade 1 (mild) – acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules grade 2 (moderate) – there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face grade 3 (moderately severe) – there’s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne grade 4 (severe) – there’s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules More severe acne can affect the back and neck. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Acne in women See your GP if your acne is more widespread, as you probably need prescription medication. For example, if: you have a large number of papules and pustules over-the-counter medication hasn’t worked Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include: topical retinoids topical antibiotics azelaic acid antibiotic tablets in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill isotretinoin tablets a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face painful nodules Hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the progestogen-only pill or contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It’s used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne. It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream. Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes. Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include: dry and tense skin a burning, itching or stinging sensation some redness and peeling of the skin Topical retinoids Topical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating) which helps to prevent them building up within hair follicles. Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They’re available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed. Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face. It’s important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV. Topical retinoids aren’t suitable for use during pregnancy, as there’s a risk they might cause birth defects. The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin. A 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this. Topical antibiotics Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They’re available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day. Side effects are uncommon, but can include: minor irritation of the skin redness and burning of the skin peeling of the skin Azelaic acid Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It’s available as a cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive). The medication doesn’t make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don’t have to avoid exposure to the sun. You’ll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves. The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include: burning or stinging skin itchiness dry skin redness of the skin Antibiotic tablets In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use. It usually takes about 6 weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne. You’ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms , during this time. Hormonal therapies Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome. If you don’t already use it, your GP may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill , even if you’re not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen. Co-cyprindiol You’ll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2 to 6 months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne. There’s a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life. For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven’t taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5 years in their early twenties. There’s also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk is estimated to be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year. Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include: bleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months headaches sore breasts mood changes loss of interest in sex weight gain or weight loss Isotretinoin Isotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects: it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a dermatologist. Common side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils changes in your blood sugar levels inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis) blood in your urine Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) kidney disease Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you’ll need a blood test Isotretinoin and birth defects Isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you’re a woman of childbearing age: don’t use isotretinoin if you’re pregnant or you think you’re pregnant You’ll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you’re not currently sexually active. If you think you may have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately. Isotretinoin is also not suitable if you’re breastfeeding. Isotretinoin and mood changes There have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There’s no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication. However, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts. These include: comedone extractor – a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads chemical peels – where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it Complications of acne Acne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. Any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it’s more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin. Scarring can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it’s important not to do this. There are 3 main types of acne scars: ice pick scars – small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object rolling scars – caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance boxcar scars – round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin See your GP if you’re considering having cosmetic surgery. They’ll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the NHS. The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons Dermabrasion Dermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush. After the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars. Punch techniques Punch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. There are 3 types of punch technique: punch excision – used to treat mild ice pick scars. The scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. After the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin. punch elevation – used to treat boxcar scars. The base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. The base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it’s level with the surface of the skin. This makes the scar much less noticeable. punch grafting – used to treat very deep ice pick scars. As with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is “plugged” with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear). Subcision Depression Acne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. This combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming depressed . You may be depressed if during the last month you’ve often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things. If you think that you or your child may have depression, it’s important to speak to your GP. talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Read more about .

Alzheimer’s disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/alzheimers-disease/,About Alzheimer’s disease ,"The first sign of Alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the Who is affected? Alzheimer’s disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer’s disease affects people aged 40 to 65. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer’s live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it’s easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Alzheimer’s disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It’s also common for people with Alzheimer’s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite. There’s increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer’s disease need palliative care . This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer’s. Can Alzheimer’s disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease isn’t clear, there’s no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. Read more about preventing Alzheimer’s disease Stages of Alzheimer’s disease In the early stages, the main symptom of Alzheimer’s disease is memory lapses. For example, someone with early Alzheimer’s disease may: forget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items forget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word repeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions become less flexible and more hesitant to try new things There are often signs of mood changes, such as increasing anxiety or agitation, or periods of confusion. As Alzheimer’s disease develops, memory problems will get worse. Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends. increasing confusion and disorientation – for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members problems with speech or language (aphasia) disturbed sleep changes in mood, such as frequent mood swings, depression and feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated difficulty performing spatial tasks, such as judging distances hallucinations By this stage, someone with Alzheimer’s disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. For example, they may need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet. Hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get worse as the condition progresses. Sometimes people with Alzheimer’s disease can be violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them. difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia) difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance considerable weight loss – although some people eat too much and put on weight unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence) or stools ( bowel incontinence ) gradual loss of speech significant problems with short- and long-term memory In the severe stages of Alzheimer’s disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and using the toilet. Read more about how Alzheimer’s disease is treated Seeking medical advice If you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. Memory problems are not just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems. Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary. Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease You’ll usually be asked some questions and carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. This can help your GP decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments. Referral to a specialist computerised tomography (CT) scan – where several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brain Support is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life. Care plan If you’re diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, it’s helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for the future. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine (known as AChE inhibitors) can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take AChE inhibitors, or for those with late-stage disease. There’s no difference in how well each of the three different AChE inhibitors work, although some people respond better to certain types or have fewer side effects. All of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. They may be prescribed by your GP on the advice of a specialist. If you’re caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. These assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects. Read guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on ","Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease Alzheimer’s disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas. It’s also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain. These reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them. Over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories. Increased risk Although it’s still unknown what triggers Alzheimer’s disease, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition. Age Age is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age. However, it’s not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Around 1 in 20 people with the condition are under 65. This is called early onset Alzheimer’s disease and it can affect people from around the age of 40. Family history The genes you inherit from your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a close family member with the condition. However, in a few families, Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition being passed on are much higher. If several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling for information and advice about your chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease when you are older. The Alzheimer’s Society website has more information about the genetics of dementia . Down’s syndrome People with Down’s syndrome are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Head injuries People who have had a severe head injury have been found to be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Cardiovascular disease Research shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. These include: smoking obesity diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol You can help reduce your risk by: stopping smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet leading an active life, both physically and mentally losing weight if you need to drinking less alcohol having regular health checks as you get older Read more about reducing your risk of Alzheimer’s disease Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease It’s best to see your GP if you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia. If you’re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going with them. It’s often very helpful having a friend or family member there. ","If you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it’s a good idea to see your GP. If you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There’s no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer’s disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to: organise testing Seeing your GP Memory problems aren’t just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by: depression or anxiety stress medications alcohol or drugs other health problems – such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficiencies Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary. Your GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. They’ll also check other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. They may also organise some blood tests Memory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area: a nurse – usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia Read more about what to do if you’ve just been diagnosed with dementia Future care planning means considering, discussing and possibly recording your wishes and decisions for future care. It’s about planning for a time when you may not be able to make some decisions for yourself. In the earlier stages of the disease, you should have the opportunity to discuss with health professionals and your family about the future. This may involve the use of: advance statements ","Preventing Alzheimer’s disease About Alzheimer’s disease Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people in the UK. Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. The exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition previous severe head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease It’s becoming increasingly understood that it’s very common to have both changes of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia).

They will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions. Assessing your mental abilities A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions. One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). This involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. Different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests. Tests what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in whether you need any financial assistance Healthcare professionals (such as your GP or psychiatrist) and social care services (which is normally your local council working with the NHS), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans. Medication . Side effects Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine can cause side effects such as: feeling and being sick dizziness diarrhoea headache agitation insomnia muscle cramps more rarely, slowing of the heartbeat – which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm. These side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. Your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions. Common side effects of memantine include: dizziness headaches high blood pressure tiredness constipation shortness of breath more rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion very rarely, seizures For more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor. For example, an occupational therapist can identify problems or unsafe areas in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. They may suggest: ways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks – such as using diaries or calendars assistive technology – devices or systems to help maintain the independence and safety of people living with dementia adding grab bars and handrails to your home to help you move around safely other professionals visiting you at home and assisting with daily tasks to maintain your independence in the community Medication, other psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), music and art therapy, reminiscence and relaxation therapies may also be offered. These may help with managing depression , anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and challenging behaviour that can occur with Alzheimer’s disease.

Preventing Alzheimer’s disease As the exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still unknown, there’s no way to prevent the condition. However, there are steps you can take that may help to delay the onset of dementia. Reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease has been linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. You may be able to reduce your risk of developing these conditions – as well as other serious problems, such as strokes and heart attacks – by taking steps to improve your cardiovascular health, including: stopping smoking not drinking large amounts of alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet , including at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day exercising for at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) every week by doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) – this will improve both your physical and mental health make sure your blood pressure is checked and controlled through regular health tests if you have diabetes , make sure you keep to the diet and take your medication Read more about preventing dementia Staying mentally active There’s some evidence to suggest that rates of dementia are lower in people who remain as mentally, physically and socially active as possible throughout their lives, as well as among those who enjoy a wide range of different activities and hobbies. It may be possible to reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia by: reading writing for pleasure learning foreign languages playing musical instruments taking part in adult education courses playing tennis playing golf swimming group sports, such as bowling walking Interventions such as “brain training” computer games have been shown to improve cognition over a short period, but research hasn’t yet demonstrated whether this can prevent dementia. Future research Research into Alzheimer’s disease is continuing. As more is revealed about the condition, other ways to treat or prevent it may be found. Participation in research is important and helps to improve dementia care and support for people with dementia, plus their carers and families. You can read about ongoing dementia research on the Alzheimer’s Research UK website. You can also ask your local memory clinic about projects taking place. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has advised that there isn’t evidence to support the use of the following to prevent dementia: statins hormone replacement therapy – when chemicals are taken to replace those that your body no longer produces vitamin E – found in a variety of foods, such as olive oil, nuts and seeds non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ",
Acute myeloid leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-teenagers-and-young-adults/acute-myeloid-leukaemia-teenagers-and-young-adults/,"Introduction Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow Tests for AML ","looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) bruises or bleeding – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection aches and pains in your bones swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin feeling unwell and run down fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection headaches and blurred vision – because of too many white blood cells breathlessness – because of too many white blood cells. Leukaemia, blood tests and bone marrow To understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow. Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs. There are 3 main types of blood cells: white blood cells – which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding The bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature). The main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells. Once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed. How leukaemia develops In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made. They build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets. Types of leukaemia Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from 2 types of blood cells: lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils Leukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL: acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts There are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people. The information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contact Macmillan . We also have more information about: having tests for AML being treated for AML If you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read general AML section.

The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia . For information about AML in people of all ages, read our general AML section. Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to: help fight infection (white cells) carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells) stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets) bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells chest X-ray – this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest If you have AML, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart). Waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a cancer support specialist on Macmillan’s free helpline . We also have more information about: getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy central nervous system (CNS) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16) You usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have AML. Most chemotherapy for AML is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). So you’ll have a ‘line’ put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. There are different kinds of lines. There will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings. Being in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. Getting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction) You have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. You’ll usually have 4 cycles of chemotherapy overall with 2 courses in the induction phase. Some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. This normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. You’ll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you’re having remission induction. This is so that the doctors can check how things are going. Chemotherapy drugs Drugs you may have include: cytarabine (Ara-C) daunorubicin, doxorubicin or idarubicin etoposide thioguanine Side effects Different chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in Macmillan’s chemotherapy section . As well as the chemotherapy drugs, you’ll be given other drugs to: help prevent you from feeling sick or being sick help prevent infections protect your kidneys as sometimes when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once it can cause kidney problems You’ll probably also need blood and platelet transfusions to top up the numbers of red cells and platelets in your blood. being more at risk of infections feeling sick hair loss a sore mouth the results of the tests that were done when you were diagnosed The following drugs may be used to treat you: cytarabine (ara-C) methotrexate Central nervous system therapy (CNS) CNS therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (The CNS or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.) CNS therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around the spinal cord and brain. It’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there. If there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you’ll have 2 lots of CNS therapy, 1 after each cycle of remission induction therapy. If there are leukaemia cells in the CSF, you’ll have CNS therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your CSF have gone. You’ll then have 2 more lots of CNS therapy just to make sure. For CNS therapy for AML, you’ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone. Side effects We also have more information about: ",

When to seek medical help Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn’t possible, contact NHS 24’s 111 service or your local out-of-hours service for advice. Why it happens The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly. This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain. Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol. nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting diarrhoea indigestion a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy) When to seek medical advice Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn’t possible, contact NHS 24 111 Service or your local out-of-hours service for advice. A blood test computerised tomography (CT) scan . However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating, indigestion and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain. Pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into it through your skin. This can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid. Infected pancreatic necrosis In around 1 in 3 severe cases of acute pancreatitis, a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs. In infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. Without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. Necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue. The dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. Once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood ( blood poisoning ) and cause multiple organ failure. If left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal. antibiotics , and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning. In some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin. Alternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used. A small cut is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. If laparoscopic surgery isn’t possible, a cut can be made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed. Infected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. Even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1 in 5. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) Another common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis. a rise in body temperature to above 38C (100.4F) or a fall in body temperature to below 36C (96.8F) a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute) ","Diagnosing acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to: gallstones – which accounts for around half of all cases alcohol consumption – which accounts for about a quarter of all cases By reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis. Read more about the and preventing acute pancreatitis . Who is affected? Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age. Men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones. How it’s treated Most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn’t always clear. Gallstones Gallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas. The blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they can start to digest the pancreas instead if the opening is blocked. However, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don’t cause any problems. Alcohol consumption Whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol a week were 4 times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4 bottles of wine a week). Binge drinking , which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. accidental damage or injury to the pancreas – for example, during a procedure to remove gallstones or examine the pancreas certain types of medication, such as some antibiotics or chemotherapy medication – acute pancreatitis can be an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people a viral infection – such as mumps or measles a complication of cystic fibrosis certain rare conditions – including hyperparathyroidism, Reye’s syndrome and Kawasaki disease Severe pancreatitis Little is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. Factors thought to increase your risk include: being 70 years of age or over being obese (a person is considered obese if they have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above) having 2 or more alcoholic drinks a day smoking Researchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are 8 times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics. Diagnosing acute pancreatitis Most cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications. Some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you’re visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don’t be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive. ","At first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You’ll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure. People with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems. Further testing Several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and assess your risk of developing more serious complications. You may have any of the following tests: a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, 3D image of your pancreas a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body an ultrasound scan – where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) An ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on X-rays is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken. This test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed. ","Complications of acute pancreatitis Preventing acute pancreatitis About acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal. Acute pancreatitis is different to chronic pancreatitis , where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years. This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose. Most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days. Read more about . Complications About 4 out of 5 cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don’t cause any serious further problems. However, 1 in 5 cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure. In severe cases where complications develop, there’s a high risk of the condition being fatal. If a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it’s likely to be several weeks or months before they’re well enough to leave hospital. Read more about the possible complications of acute pancreatitis . Many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days. Read about the potential complications of acute pancreatitis for more information on severe cases. Fluids Your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid). In severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body. Nutritional support Although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn’t restricted, some people are advised not to eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas. Depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods for a few days or longer. If you need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and often involves using a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube). Oxygen To ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving. In severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing. Painkillers Once the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated. Gallstones If a gallstone is responsible for the pancreatitis, you may need a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or your gallbladder may need to be removed. Gallbladder removal surgery may be done while you’re in hospital, or it may be planned for several weeks’ time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods. X-rays guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope to remove the gallstones. Alcohol consumption one-to-one counselling self-help groups – such as Alcoholics Anonymous a medication called acamprosate – which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings Complications of acute pancreatitis Although most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications. Pseudocysts Pseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. They’re a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition. Chronic pancreatitis If you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to chronic pancreatitis . Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life. Preventing acute pancreatitis As acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition. Gallstones The most effective way of preventing gallstones is eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day). Your diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. This helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body. There is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones. Because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it’s advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content. Foods high in cholesterol include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter and lard cakes and biscuits Being overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also help reduce your risk of developing the condition. Read more information and advice about exercise , healthy eating and losing weight . Alcohol Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. It can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as liver cancer . Read the pages on drinking and alcohol for more information and advice. ",

It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital. The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder. The affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. Unlike some others types of abdominal pain , the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn’t go away within a few hours. ","a high temperature (fever) nausea and vomiting sweating loss of appetite yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a bulge in the abdomen When to seek medical advice Contact your GP practice if: If your GP practice is closed, phone 111. It’s important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly. Diagnosing cholecystitis To diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen. They will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy’s sign. You will be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP’s hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. Your gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor’s hand. Tests you may have in hospital include: blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder Other scans – such as an X-ray , a computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan diarrhoea after eating certain foods, you can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. The organ can be useful but it’s not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. Possible complications ","Calculous cholecystitis Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt. The blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. In around 1 in every 5 cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria. Acalculous cholecystitis Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. Acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns , blood poisoning (sepsis) , severe malnutrition or AIDS . Who is affected Acute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones. ",,"fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration taking medication to relieve your pain If you have a suspected infection, you will also be given antibiotics . These often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home. Surgery cholecystectomy . Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder. If you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. In some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks. Surgery can be carried out in two main ways: laparoscopic cholecystectomy – a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomen The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) In about 1 in every 5 cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications. Preventing acute cholecystitis It’s not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones. One of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is adopting a healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. However, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. Read more about preventing gallstones . ",

Read more about the When to seek medical advice Back pain and stiffness the pain gets better with exercise but doesn’t improve, or gets worse, with rest the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night – you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain you have pain in the area around your buttocks Arthritis arthritis pain on moving the affected joint tenderness when the affected joint is examined swelling and warmth in the affected area Enthesitis Enthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones). Common sites for enthesitis are: at the top of the shin bone behind the heel (Achilles tendon) under the heel where the ribs join to the breast bone If your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply. Fatigue Fatigue is a common symptom of untreated AS. It can make you feel tired and lacking in energy. When to seek medical advice Back pain associated with AS can be quite distinctive. For example, it usually doesn’t improve with rest and may wake you up during the night. Blood tests If your GP suspects AS, they may arrange blood tests If your results suggest you do have inflammation, you will be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. A rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints. Further tests Your rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. These are described below. X-rays An X-ray of your lower back can show damage to the joints at the base of your spine (the sacroiliac joints) and new bone forming between the vertebrae (bones in your spine), which are common signs of advanced AS. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may highlight changes in your sacroiliac joints that might not show up on an X-ray. It may also show any inflammation of ligaments in the spinal region. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan can pick up inflammation of the tissues (tendons and ligaments) attached to your bones. Genetic testing A genetic blood test may sometimes be carried out to see if you carry the HLA-B27 gene, which is found in most people with AS. Paracetamol If NSAIDs are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such as paracetamol , may be recommended. Anti-TNF medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of TNF, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis. Examples of anti-TNF medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab. Amyloidosis In very rare cases, it is possible to develop a condition called amyloidosis as a complication of AS. Amyloid is a protein produced by cells in your bone marrow (the spongy material found in the centres of some hollow bones). Amyloidosis is a condition where amyloid builds up in organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver. shortness of breath and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet. Problems with employment Over time, AS can increasingly affect your ability to work. Some people with the condition may be unable to work at all and others may need changes to their working life, such as working part-time, working from home or avoiding physically demanding work. When at work, it is important to maintain a good posture when sitting or standing for long periods of time. You should get up, stretch and move around regularly. This could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks. ","Diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis In AS, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed. As well as causing pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). This fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis. Read more about the . Who is affected AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45. AS is around three times more common in men than in women. There are around 200,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with the condition. How ankylosing spondylitis is treated In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the vertebrae (bones in the spine) and spinal joints. Over time, this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone, which in some cases can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility. This is known as ankylosis. HLA-B27 gene Research has shown that more than 9 out of 10 people with AS carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27). Having this gene does not necessarily mean you will develop AS. It is estimated that 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the HLA-B27 gene, but most do not have AS. It is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing AS, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors – although it is not known what these are. Testing for this gene may be carried out if AS is suspected. However, this test is not a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the HLA-B27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis. Read about how ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed . Can ankylosing spondylitis be inherited? AS can run in families, and the HLA-B27 gene can be inherited from another family member. If you have AS and tests have shown you carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. If you have AS but don’t carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%. If you have a close relative who has AS, such as a parent or a sibling (brother or sister), you are three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who does not have a relative with the condition. Diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis Codeine If necessary, as well as paracetamol, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine. Codeine can cause side effects including feeling sick, vomiting, constipation and drowsiness. Anti-TNF medication pain or numbness in your lower back and buttocks weakness in your legs – which can affect your ability to walk urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence (when you cannot control your bladder or bowels) ","Confirming ankylosing spondylitis Although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of AS. at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn’t improve with rest limited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back) limited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sex If you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis – or if you only have sacroiliitis – you will be diagnosed with “probable ankylosing spondylitis”. has been confirmed your level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved your Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Any complications of ankylosing spondylitis that arise will be treated as they develop. Complications of ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions. Some complications associated with AS are outlined below. Reduced flexibility Although most people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, around 4 in every 10 people with the condition will eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine. This usually only affects the lower back and is the result of the bones in the spine fusing (joining up). Fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your posture becomes fixed in one position, although it doesn’t lead to severe disability in most cases. In rare cases, surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine. Joint damage AS can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed. This can damage the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move. If a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one. Iritis Iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with AS where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. It usually only affects one eye, rather than both. If you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). Your vision may also become blurred or cloudy. You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly. ","Complications of ankylosing spondylitis About ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed. Read more about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis . exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation – such as painkillers and a type of medicine called anti-TNF medication Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon. Read more about . Outlook The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people, the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others the condition can get progressively worse over time. Around 70-90% of people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However, some people eventually become severely disabled due to the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees. For example, AS can lead to osteoporosis (weakening of the bones), spinal fractures and cardiovascular disease (a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels). Read more about the complications of ankylosing spondylitis . Information about you If you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register . Read more about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis . Physiotherapy and exercise Keeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful. Types of physiotherapy recommended for AS include: a group exercise programme – where you exercise with others an individual exercise programme – you are given exercises to do by yourself massage – your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with AS) hydrotherapy – exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the buoyancy of the water helps make movement easier by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles Some people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important. If you’re ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise. The National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition. Painkillers You may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) The first type of painkiller usually prescribed is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) . As well as helping to ease pain, NSAIDs can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen , naproxen and diclofenac. However, they have been used for longer in people with rheumatoid arthritis , and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety. If your rheumatologist recommends using anti-TNF medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. This is because anti-TNF medication can interfere with the immune system (the body’s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections. NICE guidelines The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance about the use of anti-TNF medication for AS. NICE states that adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if: your Corticosteroids Corticosteroids have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with AS. If a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. After the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours. It is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. This is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as: infection in response to the injection the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation) the surrounding tissue may waste away a tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst) Corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis. Two DMARDs sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Surgery Most people with AS will not need surgery. However, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged, joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. For example, if the hip joints are affected, a hip replacement may be carried out. In rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed if the spine becomes badly bent. Follow-up Iritis can usually be treated with corticosteroid eye drops. Osteoporosis and spinal fractures Osteoporosis is where the bones become weak and brittle. In AS, osteoporosis can develop in the spine and can increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone. The longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases. If you do develop osteoporosis, you will usually need to take medication to help strengthen your bones. There are a number of medications that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection. Read more about . Cardiovascular disease If you have AS, you may also have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) . CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke . Due to this increased risk, it is important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing CVD. stopping smoking – if you smoke losing weight – if you are overweight or obese taking regular exercise – 150 minutes of exercise per week can greatly increase your health making changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control – such as diabetes or high blood pressure You may also be prescribed medication to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level.

",", such as: sneezing itchiness a blocked or runny nose Some people only get allergic rhinitis seasonally because they’re allergic to things like tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. When to get medical advice Speak to your GP practice if: you also have asthma and it’s getting worse Do take over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines clean your nasal passages with a salt water solution avoid triggers if you can corticosteroids . ",Allergic rhinitis is caused by breathing in tiny particles that you’re allergic to. The most common allergens in the air that cause rhinitis are: house dust mites pollen and spores flakes of animal skin wood dust flour dust latex You’re more likely to develop an allergy if there’s a history of allergies in your family. Complications of allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include: nasal polyps – abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) growths inside the nose and sinuses sinusitis – inflammation that blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual blockage of the middle ear – due to a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum These problems can often be treated with medication.

Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) In rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening. This affects the whole body and usually develops within minutes of exposure to something you’re allergic to. swelling of the throat and mouth difficulty breathing lightheadedness confusion blue skin or lips collapsing and losing consciousness If your allergy is more severe or it’s not obvious what you’re allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP as you may need referred for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic. The tests that may be carried out are described below. Skin prick testing Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests. It involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes. Skin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don’t take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results. Blood tests Blood tests may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies. A sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen. Patch tests Patch tests are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen. A small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction. Elimination diet If you have a suspected food allergy After a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction. Don’t attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional. Challenge testing In a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy. During the test, you’re given the food you think you’re allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision. This test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop. Avoiding exposure to allergens For example, you may be able to help manage: food allergies by being careful about what you eat animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly mould allergies by keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation hay fever by staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high dust mite allergies by using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets Read more about preventing allergic reactions . Allergy medications Medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on the Pharmacy First Scotland service without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they’re not suitable for everyone. Antihistamines Antihistamines are the main medicines for allergies. They can be used: to prevent allergic reactions – for example, you may take them in the morning if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day Antihistamines can be taken as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy. Decongestants Decongestants Lotions and creams Red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as: emollients (moisturising creams) to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens calamine lotion to reduce itchiness steroids to reduce inflammation (see below) Steroids Steroid medications can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction. They’re available as: nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed nose and eyes creams for eczema and contact dermatitis inhalers for asthma tablets for hives (urticaria) Sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription.

Mould spores Tiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people. You can help prevent this by: keeping your home dry and well-ventilated removing any indoor pot plants from your home not drying clothes indoors, store clothes in damp cupboards or packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes dealing with any damp and condensation in your home avoiding damp buildings, damp woods and rotten leaves, cut grass and compost heaps Food allergies By law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that’s known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction. People with food allergies most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by: not relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens) communicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice avoiding places where there’s a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries let restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is always check what allergens are in the dish even if you have eaten it before, as recipes and ingredients can change Remember, simple dishes are less likely to contain “hidden” ingredients.

Hay fever Pollen allergies – more commonly known as hay fever – are caused when trees and grasses release pollen into the air. Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis. Different plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses). To help keep your hay fever under control, you can: check weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it’s high, if possible avoid drying clothes and bedding outside when the pollen count is high wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes keep doors and windows shut when possible shower and change your clothes after being outside avoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields – particularly in the early morning, evening or night, when the pollen count is highest if you have a lawn, try asking someone else to cut the grass for you Insect bites and stings If you’ve ever suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting, it’s important to take precautions to minimise your risk. When you’re outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could: cover exposed skin wear shoes apply insect repellent avoid wearing strong perfumes or fragrances, as these can attract insects Read more about preventing insect bites and stings . Preventing severe allergies (anaphylaxis) If you’re at risk of experiencing a severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors with you everywhere.

Consider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis . ","For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food’s ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling . Allergies occur when the body’s immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it’s harmful. It’s not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it’s the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. It’s thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances. choosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet fitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean choosing leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture cleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming using tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners regularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth – avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the air Concentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room. You can find more information on indoor allergies in the home on the Allergy UK website. Pets If you can’t permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try: keeping pets outside as much as possible, or limiting them to a particular area of the house, preferably an area without carpet not allowing pets in bedrooms washing pets at least once a week regularly grooming pets outside regularly washing all bedding and soft furnishings on which a pet has lain using an air filter in rooms where you spend most of your time increase ventilation with fans, air-conditioning or by opening windows ",,"Preventing an allergic reaction About allergies An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance. Allergies are very common. They’re thought to affect more than 1 in 4 people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren’t previously allergic to. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Common allergies Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen – an allergy to these is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) dust mites animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) food – particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow’s milk insect bites and stings medication – including ibuprofen , aspirin, and certain antibiotics latex – used to make some gloves and condoms mould – these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in household chemicals – including those in detergents and hair dyes Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren’t allergic to them.

Read more about and avoiding allergic reactions . anaphylaxis for information about what to do if it occurs. Testing for allergies The injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be taken at home. Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. If you’re at risk of this, you’ll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency. . Preventing an allergic reaction The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you’re allergic to, although this isn’t always easy or practical. Below is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens. House dust mites ",

Read more about fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness) muscle weakness low mood (mild depression ) or irritability loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss the need to urinate frequently increased thirst craving for salty foods Dehydration can also be an early sign of Addison’s disease. It’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water. You may go on to develop: low blood pressure when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea abdominal, joint or back pain muscle cramps chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression brownish discolouration of the skin, lips and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees a reduced libido (lack of interest in sex) , particularly in women Some women may also have irregular periods or miss some periods completely. Children with Addison’s disease may experience puberty later than usual. Some people with Addison’s disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) Read more about diagnosing Addison’s disease and Signs of an adrenal crisis include: severe dehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting and diarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know with Addison’s disease is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance. If an adrenal crisis isn’t treated, it can lead to a coma . It’s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families. Genetics Research has shown that some people with certain genes are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders. It’s not clear how these genes lead to Addison’s disease and similar conditions, but it does mean your risk of developing Addison’s disease is increased if you or a close family member have another autoimmune condition, such as: Diagnosing Addison’s disease They’re also likely to ask if anyone in your family has an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system). Your GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as: where skin creases on your palm in your elbow crease on any scars your lips and gums However, hyperpigmentation doesn’t occur in all cases of Addison’s disease. You’ll also be tested for low blood pressure (hypotension) while you’re lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position). Blood tests If Addison’s disease is suspected, blood tests will be carried out to measure the levels of sodium, potassium and cortisol in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate Addison’s disease. You may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood to be tested for the following: a low level of the hormone aldosterone a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy) positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland) Any of these could be a sign of Addison’s disease. Synacthen stimulation test Synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. When synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and other steroid hormones into the blood. A blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement. If the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it’s usually confirmation of Addison’s disease. Thyroid function test As well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it’s working properly. Your thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body’s growth and metabolism. People with Addison’s disease often have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) , where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism. Scans In some cases, your specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands. This could be a computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . appear quickly and severely. During an adrenal crisis, there’s not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison’s disease. ","Diagnosing Addison’s disease tuberculosis (TB) , although this is uncommon in the UK. Read more about the Addison’s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces. Problems with the immune system In the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison’s disease, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases. The immune system is your body’s defence against infection and disease. If you’re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness. However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder. Addison’s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won’t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you’ll experience type 1 diabetes – a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of Addison’s disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body. It can cause Addison’s disease if it damages your adrenal glands. infections – such as those linked to AIDS , or fungal infections a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis or other types of severe sepsis cancer – if cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them surgical removal of both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) – for example, to remove a tumour adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) – a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that most often affects young boys tuberculosis (TB) is treated with a course of antibiotics over a period of at least 6 months. However, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can’t be cured. Medication for Addison’s disease ","If Addison’s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where the ","About Addison’s disease Addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline. In Addison’s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced. About 8,400 people in the UK have Addison’s disease. It can affect people of any age. It’s most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It’s also more common in women than men. Addison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You’ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. Information about you If you have Addison’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register Adrenal crisis Read more about Driving If you’re diagnosed with Addison’s disease and have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it’s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Read about driving and Addison’s disease on the GOV.UK website. If you have Addison’s disease, you’ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue. corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. It’s usually taken in tablet form 2 or 3 times a day. In most cases, a medication called hydrocortisone is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used. Aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you’re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this may not be necessary. Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it. In general, the medications used for Addison’s disease don’t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there’s a risk of problems such as weakened bones (osteoporosis) , mood swings and difficulty sleeping (insomnia) . Living with Addison’s disease Many people with Addison’s disease find that taking their medication enables them to continue with their normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy. Some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health. Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late, can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia. Some people can develop associated health conditions, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid You’ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6 to 12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary. Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits. Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so you must: remember to collect your repeat prescriptions keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you take your medication every day at the right time pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below) carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary You could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one. Medical alert bracelets It’s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people you have Addison’s disease. After a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you’ll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis. Medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there’s one they recommend, or go to the MedicAlert website. If you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It’s important to note that this advice still applies if you’re not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason. Adjusting your medication At certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following: an illness or infection – particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F) an accident, such as a car crash an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy) you’re taking part in strenuous exercise not usually part of your daily life You and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency. This could be necessary if you go into shock after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you’re pregnant and have morning sickness. Your endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary. If you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always phone your GP immediately afterwards. Check what out-of-hours services are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours. You can also register yourself with your local ambulance service , so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance. Adrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Phone 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis. Signs of an adrenal crisis include: severe dehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting and diarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness In hospital, you’ll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You’ll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone. ",
Alcohol-related liver disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/alcohol-related-liver-disease/,About alcohol-related liver disease ,"feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. If you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. Read more about: diagnosing ARLD Alcohol and the liver With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. Its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and disease The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is very common in the UK – the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2 weeks, your liver should return to normal. Alcoholic hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis – which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis – is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they’re damaging their liver through alcohol. Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking) . The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis It’s generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. A person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn’t stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5 more years. How ARLD is treated abdominal pain loss of appetite fatigue feeling sick diarrhoea feeling generally unwell yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema) swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks very itchy skin hair loss unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers) blotchy red palms significant weight loss weakness and muscle wasting confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping ( insomnia ) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can’t process them) When to seek medical advice Read about alcohol misuse (drinking too much) . Contact your GP for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse. A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4 questions: Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? Have you ever drunk an ‘eye-opener’, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves? If you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP. Read more about how ARLD is diagnosed . If a doctor suspects ARLD, they’ll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption. cirrhosis – you may need further tests. Imaging tests Scans may be needed to produce detailed images of your liver. This may include: an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred. Liver biopsy During a liver biopsy , a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. The biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic , either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. Specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage. Endoscopy An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. During an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach. Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis. Many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month. In some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process. Some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so their progress can be closely monitored. If you’re staying at home, you’ll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service. Preventing relapses The use of medication to directly treat ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued there’s limited evidence for its effectiveness. agitation confusion disorientation muscle stiffness muscle tremors difficulty speaking in very serious cases, a coma Hepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood. Liver cancer Liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing liver cancer . Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse . It’s estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer. ","Diagnosing alcohol-related liver disease . Stages of ARLD There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there’s often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below. Alcoholic fatty liver disease Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. smoking and high blood pressure . Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancer Read more about the complications of ARLD . Preventing ARLD The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the low-risk drinking guidelines . Even if you’ve been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health. Read our drinking and alcohol pages for more information and advice. Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD. There are 2 ways alcohol misuse (drinking too much) can cause ARLD. These are: drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause hepatitis and cirrhosis , the more serious types of ARLD Evidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD. Read more about alcohol units and how to calculate them. Additional factors As well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These include: being overweight or obese being female – women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol having a pre-existing liver condition, such as hepatitis C genetics – alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families Diagnosing alcohol-related liver disease Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver. ",,"Complications of alcohol-related liver disease About alcohol-related liver disease support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn’t improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You’ll only be considered for a liver transplant if you’ve developed complications of cirrhosis , despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life. Read more about . Complications Blood tests Blood tests used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease. Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn’t functioning properly. A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage. Lab Tests Online has more information on liver function tests . Further testing Stopping drinking alcohol If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2 weeks. After this point, it’s usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption . If you have a more serious form of ARLD – alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis – life-long abstinence is recommended. This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease. Stopping drinking isn’t easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem. If psychological therapy alone isn’t effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as: acamprosate naltrexone disulfiram Read our page on Self-help groups Many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is Alcoholics Anonymous , but there are many other groups that can help. Read the alcohol support page for more information about the help available. Diet and nutrition Malnutrition is common in people with ARLD, so it’s important to eat a balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need. Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid. The damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen – a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet. Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals. Your GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian. In the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach. Other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include: anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands ) However, there’s a lack of good evidence that these help and they’re no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Liver transplants In the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. A liver transplant is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure. A liver transplant may be considered if: you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol you’re otherwise well enough to survive such an operation you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life Complications of alcohol-related liver disease A number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD). Portal hypertension and varices Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. It occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level. When the liver becomes severely scarred, it’s harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines. The blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices. If the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed. This can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to anaemia . Alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like. Split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices. Ascites A person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites. Initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic . One of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death. Hepatic encephalopathy One of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy. ",
Anxiety,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/anxiety/,"Anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear, that can be mild or severe. Generalised anxiety disorder ","Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal. But some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and often affect their daily lives. Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) social anxiety disorder (social phobia) The information on this page is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). restlessness a sense of dread feeling constantly “on edge” difficulty concentrating irritability dizziness tiredness a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat ( palpitations ) muscle aches and tension trembling or shaking dry mouth excessive sweating shortness of breath stomach ache feeling sick headache pins and needles difficulty falling or staying asleep ( insomnia ) You may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem. Anxiety triggers If you’re anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder , you’ll usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety. However, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you’re feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it. You may start to worry that there’ll be no solution.

Anal cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/anal-cancer/,Anal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the very end of the large bowel. ,"(haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores). bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding) itching and pain around the anus small lumps around the anus a discharge of mucus from the anus loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) Diagnosing anal cancer They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its 2015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks. If you’re referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions. Some of the tests you may have include a: sigmoidoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities proctoscopy – where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread. You can read more about the stages of anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. How anal cancer is treated palliative care . Chemoradiation Surgery ","The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) – a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body having anal sex or lots of sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV having a history of cervical , vaginal or vulval cancer smoking having a weakened immune system – for example, if you have HIV Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men. Further information about anal cancer Cancer Research UK: anal cancer Macmillan: anal cancer ",,"chemoradiation – a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel The tube means you don’t need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you. A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC. Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for 5 to 6 weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required. Read more about how radiotherapy is carried out Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including: tiredness sore skin around the anus sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women hair loss – limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area feeling sick diarrhoea These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility Other possible long-term side effects can include: bowel control problems long-term (chronic) diarrhoea erectile dysfunction vaginal pain when having sex dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic , that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days. An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery. During the operation, a permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation. Before and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time. Read more about living with a colostomy Follow-up To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually become less frequent over time. ",
Anaphylaxis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/immune-system/anaphylaxis/,About anaphylaxis ,"Call 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available. If you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it. Adrenaline injections If there’s no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. This should be injected into the opposite thigh. Read Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2014 guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (PDF, 188kb) . Positioning and resuscitation In most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart. Pregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart. If the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. If the person is unconscious, check that their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. Then put them in the recovery position to make sure they don’t choke on their vomit. Place the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin. If the person’s breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed. Admission to hospital While in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure. As well as adrenaline, additional medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids Blood tests may also be carried out while you’re in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis. You will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis. An adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis . Preventing anaphylaxis If you have anaphylaxis, you should be offered advice and medication to help prevent further episodes. Allergy clinic You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic for tests to find out what caused the anaphylaxis. Knowing what allergen triggered the allergic reaction can help you avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis. Some of the tests commonly used to determine allergies include: a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts by becoming red, raised and itchy a blood test – a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergen Read more about diagnosing allergies . Adrenaline auto-injectors You may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if you’ve had a previous episode of anaphylaxis and there’s a risk of you having another episode in the future. There are 3 types of auto-injector: EpiPen Jext Emerade Each type is slightly different, and you should make sure you know how to use your auto-injector correctly. You can also ask for a “trainer” kit so you can practise giving yourself or your child injections. The following points are important: Carry your auto-injector(s) at all times – there should be no exceptions. It may also be recommended that you get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor’s contact details to alert others. Extremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective, so don’t leave your auto-injector in the fridge or your car’s glove compartment. Check the expiry date regularly. An out-of-date injector will offer limited protection. The manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information. If your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately 4.5 stone). Avoid triggers If a trigger has been identified as causing your episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to take steps to avoid it in the future. Food You can reduce the chances of being exposed to a food allergen by: checking food labels letting staff at a restaurant know what you’re allergic to, so it’s not included in your meal remembering that some types of food may contain small traces of potential allergens – for example, some sauces contain wheat and peanuts See our page on living with a food allergy for more information. Insect stings You can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as: moving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking – don’t wave your arms around or swat at them using an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summer ","Anaphylaxis is the result of your body’s immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens. Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4 hours later. The most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are: insect stings – particularly wasp and bee stings peanuts and tree nuts other types of foods – such as milk and seafood certain medicines – such as antibiotics Read more about the . Preventing further episodes If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it’s important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers. You may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis . Who is affected? Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as asthma or the allergic skin condition atopic eczema , are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. In the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat. Triggers Some of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below. Insect stings Most cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis. It’s estimated around 1 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis. Foods More than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts. Other foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include: nuts – such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts milk fish and shellfish eggs some types of fruit – such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries Medicines Medicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include: antibiotics – particularly penicillin-like antibiotics general anaesthetic – muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – a type of painkiller that includes ibuprofen and aspirin An adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected. The signs of suspected anaphylaxis are: problems breathing feeling faint or dizzy loss of consciousness The injection can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes – if it’s a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example – another person may need to do it. Before attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. You should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector. After injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Injections can be given through clothing. After injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better. ",,"Preventing anaphylaxis About anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly. It is also known as anaphylactic shock. Signs of anaphylaxis include: itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet feeling lightheaded or faint swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties wheezing abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting collapse and unconsciousness What to do Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline should be given as soon as possible. Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline. This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device. You should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not. If after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh. A second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again. The person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. If the person is unconscious, you should move them to the recovery position – on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person’s breathing or heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed. Read more about . For example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around: 1 in 1,480 after taking a NSAID-type painkiller 1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin 1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaesthetic Contrast agents Contrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such as X-rays . For example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the X-ray. This is known as angiography . The risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than 1 in 10,000. Rubber latex Less than 1 in 100 people in the population has a natural rubber latex allergy. Healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy. Those with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected. Idiopathic anaphylaxis Sometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis. Read more about preventing insect stings . Medicines If you’re allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. For example, if you’re allergic to: penicillin – you can normally safely take a different group of antibiotics known as macrolides non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen and aspirin – you can normally safely take paracetamol , but read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don’t contain NSAIDs one type of general anaesthetic – others are available, or it may be possible to perform surgery using a local anaesthetic or an epidural injection angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – alternative blood pressure medications, such as calcium channel blockers, can be used Always tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them. Contrast agents There may be times when it’s necessary to use contrast agents – for example, if you had bleeding inside your brain – even if this places you at risk of anaphylaxis. In such circumstances, you can be given injections of antihistamines and corticosteroids ",
Angina,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/angina/,About angina ,"The main symptom of angina is chest pain. This can: feel like a dull pain, ache, ‘heavy’ or ‘tight’ feeling in your chest spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back be triggered by physical exertion Angina itself is not life threatening, but prolonged chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack. Phone 999 immediately if: central chest pain or discomfort in the chest that doesn’t go away – it may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing pain that radiates down the left arm, or both arms, or to the neck, jaw, back or stomach unconsciousness seizures or fitting difficulty breathing (snoring or rasping) chest pain alongside breathlessness, nausea and sweating Speak to your GP if you: test If your GP is closed, phone 111. Diagnosing angina To diagnose angina, you will be assessed and you may need to have several tests. You will also be asked some questions about: if there were any triggers for the pain your family’s medical history lifestyle risk factors (like smoking, for example) Tests for angina You might also be given some tests to determine if you already have heart disease or you’re at risk of it. measuring your weight measuring blood pressure taking blood to check cholesterol levels, diabetes or anaemia If it’s thought that you have angina, you might be referred to the hospital for some more tests. These might include: electrocardiogram (ECG) – measures the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart exercise tolerance test (ETT) – measures the activity of the heart during exercise myocardial perfusion scan (MPS or MYoview) – measures how well blood is reaching the heart coronary angiography – shows whether your coronary arteries are narrow and how severe any blockages are blood tests – help to identify increased enzyme levels (troponin) which are released when the heart is damaged Types of angina The 2 main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina. Stable angina is more common. Attacks are more likely to have a trigger (like physical activity or stress). Attacks of unstable angina can be unpredictable and develop without any clear triggers. They might also last longer and continue even when resting. You may be given: low-dose aspirin clopidogrel Ticagrelor ",,,"About angina Angina is chest pain which occurs when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted because of narrowing or blockages in the blood vessels around the heart. There are various ways to treat and manage angina. Stable angina If you have stable angina you may be given medicine to: prevent and treat angina attacks reduce your risk of a heart attack Nitrates You may be given nitrates if you have stable angina. These work by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels so that blood can pass through more easily. You might be given nitrates as: slow release tablets a fast acting spray or tablet Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is usually given in a fast acting spray or tablets. You should keep this with you at all times. If you experience an episode of angina you can use the spray or tablet under your tongue. The pain should then ease within a few minutes. You can repeat the dose after 5 minutes if the pain has not gone away. If the pain has still not gone 5 minutes after you take the second dose you should call an ambulance. Beta blockers Beta blockers work mainly by slowing down the heart. Calcium channel blockers Calcium channel blockers relax the arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart muscle. If you cannot have beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, you may be given another medicine. Your doctor will discuss this with you. Reducing your risk of a heart attack or stroke To reduce your risk of more serious cardiovascular problems, your doctor might give you: a low dose of aspirin to prevent blood clots statins to reduce your cholesterol (blood fats) level ACE inhibitors to reduce your blood pressure Unstable angina Surgery for angina There are 2 types of procedures that are used to treat angina. These are a: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) The best option for you depends on your circumstances. You should discuss the different options with your doctor. It’s likely that you will need to continue taking some medicines after surgery. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) A CABG is where a section of a blood vessel is taken from another part of the body. This is then used to re-route the flow of blood past a blocked or narrow section of artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) PCI is where a narrowed section of artery is widened using a balloon and a tiny tube called a stent. It’s also known as a coronary angioplasty. ",
Arterial thrombosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/arterial-thrombosis/,About arterial thrombosis ,"Who’s at risk of arterial thrombosis? Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when a process called atherosclerosis damages an artery. Fatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow. Depending on where the clot is in your body, a bloodclot in an artery (arterial thrombosis) can cause: angina heart attack stroke peripheral vascular disease Find out about each of these below. Heart attack A heart attack can happen when a blood clot completely blocks an artery that pumps blood to your heart muscle. You may experience: a crushing central chest pain or mild chest discomfort shortness of breath a clammy, sweaty and grey complexion dizziness nausea and vomiting If you suspect you or someone you know is having a heart attack, dial 999 Stroke Arterial thrombosis can cause a stroke if a blood clot is blocking an artery that supplies blood to your brain. numbness or weakness down one side, ranging in severity from weakness in your hand to complete paralysis of the whole side of your body weakness in your face, which can make you drool saliva dizziness difficulty talking and understanding what others are saying problems with balance and co-ordination difficulty swallowing If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, dial 999 Further information on a stroke Peripheral vascular disease If you have a narrowing of an artery in one or both of your legs (peripheral vascular disease) you may: be more susceptible to developing a clot have pain when exercising, usually in the lower half of your legs have pain that may affect both legs, but develops in one leg before the other have pale, cold skin and numbness in one of your legs Peripheral vascular disease can also cause other problems such as impotence ( erectile dysfunction ). 999 . ","Diagnosing arterial thrombosis Arterial thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms within an artery, slowing or stopping the flow of blood. How it happens Your blood contains cells called platelets and proteins (clotting factors). Together they make up the blood-clotting mechanism. When a blood vessel is cut, the platelets and clotting factors in your blood mesh together to form a solid clot at the site of the wound. This clot acts as a plug to stop the wound from bleeding. Normally, the blood-clotting mechanism is triggered when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeds, such as when you cut yourself. However, the blood may sometimes begin to clot even when a blood vessel has not been damaged. If this happens, a blood clot can form within a vein or artery (thrombosis). Most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by atherosclerosis. Fatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow. The risk factors for a blood clot in an artery include: eating a high-fat diet smoking alcohol misuse obesity lack of exercise diabetes (both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes ) high blood pressure (hypertension) Diagnosing arterial thrombosis The tests used to diagnose blood clots in the arteries (arterial thrombosis) will depend on what medical condition the blood clot has triggered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Suspected cases of unstable angina and heart attacks are diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals that will show on paper. This allows your doctor to see how well your heart is functioning or if there are any areas not receiving blood as in a heart attack. Find out more about having an ECG Blood test Blood may also be taken to measure levels of a protein called troponin. This is released when the heart muscle is damaged by a heart attack. Find out more about blood tests Scans Suspected cases of stroke are diagnosed by producing a scan of the brain using a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . ",,"Preventing arterial thrombosis About arterial thrombosis Arterial thrombosis is a blood clot that develops in an artery. It’s dangerous as it can obstruct or stop the flow of blood to major organs, such as the heart or brain. If a blood clot narrows one or more of the arteries leading to the heart, muscle pain known as angina can occur. If a blood clot blocks the arteries leading to part of the heart muscle, it will cause a heart attack. If it blocks an artery in the brain, it will cause a stroke . Medication Medication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart. Surgery Surgery involves a surgeon accessing the affected artery. They will either: unblock it re-route the blood flow via another blood vessel “graft” the blood vessel to travel around, or past, the section that’s blocked Preventing arterial thrombosis If you’ve had a blood clot in an artery, you may need to take medication to prevent it from happening again. It’s also vital that you live a healthy lifestyle. This includes: stopping smoking (if you smoke) doing some physical activity reducing the amount of salt and saturated fat that you eat Find out more about preventing arterial thrombosis medication surgery Medication Medication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart. Surgery You may need a heart procedure if the blood clot is in an artery that supplies blood to your heart. Coronary angioplasty A coronary angioplasty is the most common type of procedure for a heart attack. A hollow metal tube called a stent is inserted to widen the artery and stop it from blocking again. Find out more about having a coronary angioplasty Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) Occasionally, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may be carried out after a heart attack. A blood vessel that is taken from another part of the body is used to bypass where the blockage is. Find out more about having a CABG Carotid endarterectomy Another type of surgery for arterial thrombosis is called carotid endarterectomy, which you may have if you have had a blood clot in an artery in your neck (causing a stroke). The surgeon makes a cut in your neck to open up the artery and remove the fatty deposits. Preventing arterial thrombosis It’s not possible to prevent blood clots altogether, but there are a number of ways to reduce the risks of developing a blood clot in an artery. Medication If you’ve had blood clot in an artery before, you might need to take medication to prevent it from happening again. Medication can include: statins – used to lower your blood cholesterol levels anticoagulant medicines- such as warfarin antiplatelet medicines – such as low-dose aspirin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) Lifestyle In addition to medication, it’s vital that you look after your health and take steps to improve your lifestyle. Most cases of arterial thrombosis are associated with atherosclerosis (the ‘furring up’ of your arteries with fatty deposits). This can lead to a blood clot in an artery and cause a heart attack or stroke. Making healthy changes to your lifestyle can greatly reduce the effects of this condition, and others such a heart disease. Things you could do include: stopping smoking (if you smoke) reduce your alcohol intake to recommended limits reduce salt intake eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables and 2 portions of fish per week (1 oily) do a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate exercise such as walking or cycling at least 5 times a week ",
Appendicitis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/appendicitis/,About appendicitis ,"Diagnosing appendicitis . When to get medical help If you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren’t available, phone NHS 24’s 111 service for advice. You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Read more about: diagnosing appendicitis complications of appendicitis How appendicitis is treated In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent. The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted. Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult. Most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6 weeks after open surgery. Read more about Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. feeling sick (nausea) being sick loss of appetite diarrhoea a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face When to get medical help If you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren’t available, phone NHS 24 111 Service for advice. Appendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as: gastroenteritis severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) constipation bladder or urine infections Crohn’s disease pelvic infection ectopic pregnancy or menstrual pain. Also, some people’s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as: the pelvis behind the large intestine around the small bowel near the right lower part of the liver Some people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it’s caused by something else, such as: gastroenteritis severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) constipation a bladder or urine infection Further tests Further tests may involve: a blood test to look for signs of infection a pregnancy test for women a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection an ultrasound scan to see if the appendix is swollen a computerised tomography (CT) scan Risks Appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare. However, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include: antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections severe continuous abdominal pain feeling sick or being sick a high temperature (fever) a rapid heartbeat shortness of breath with rapid breathing swelling of the abdomen ","For example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel. This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting. Who’s affected? Appendicitis is a common condition. It’s estimated around 1 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life. Appendicitis can develop at any age, but it’s most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old. You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst. If the appendix bursts, it can cause peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen. Read more about the complications of appendicitis . Diagnosing appendicitis scarring – both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made a collection of pus (abscess) – in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery hernia – at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach The use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to pneumonia . However, serious complications like this are very rare. Alternatives to emergency surgery In some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass. This lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself. If an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it’s not necessary to operate immediately. Instead, you’ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled. Another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis. However, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn’t enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case. Complications of appendicitis If appendicitis isn’t treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections. Phone 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst. Peritonitis If your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. This can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen. ","You’ll usually be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it’s eventually found to be normal. This is because it’s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting. In humans, the appendix doesn’t perform any important function and having it removed doesn’t cause any long-term problems. The procedure Appendectomies are carried out under general anaesthetic using either a keyhole or open technique. Keyhole surgery Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery. This operation involves making 3 or 4 small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including: a tube that gas is pumped through to inflate your abdomen – this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work a laparoscope – a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor small surgical tools used to remove the appendix Once the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable stitches. Regular stitches may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later. Open surgery In some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn’t recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include: when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass when the surgeon isn’t very experienced in laparoscopic removal people who have previously had open abdominal surgery In these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix. When there’s widespread peritonitis – infection of the inner lining of the abdomen – it’s sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy. As with keyhole surgery, the incision is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches that need to be removed at a later date. After both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it’s rare for a serious problem to be found. Recovery One of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation. If the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery – for example, if you have peritonitis – it may take up to a week before you’re well enough to go home. For the first few days after the operation you’re likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary. If you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation. You may also experience some short-term constipation . You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome. Before leaving hospital, you’ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid. In most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery. When to seek medical advice While you recover, it’s important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems. Contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice: increasing pain and swelling you start vomiting repeatedly a high temperature (fever) any discharge coming from the wound the wound is hot to touch ","Complications of appendicitis About appendicitis Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5 to 10cm (2 to 4 inches) long. It’s connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed. Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn’t harmful. Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhoea . Read more about the . Read more about . If you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy. antibiotics and the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy). Abscesses Sometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix. This is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body’s attempt to fight the infection. It can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases. Abscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess. This can be carried out under ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) guidance using local anaesthetic and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the placement of a drain. If an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed out and a course of antibiotics is given. ",
Atrial fibrillation,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/atrial-fibrillation/,About atrial fibrillation ,"Atrial fibrillation can lead to a number of problems, including: dizziness feeling faint shortness of breath fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations) feeling very tired Find out more about the Why does atrial fibrillation happen and how common is it? Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance and affects up to 800,000 people in the UK. The cause of atrial fibrillation is not fully understood, but it tends to occur in certain groups of people and may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking. The condition can affect adults of any age or gender but: is more common the older you get affects about 10% of people over 75 more common in men than women Atrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, like: high blood pressure diabetes coronary heart disease Find out more about the The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation (AF) is palpitations caused by a fast and irregular heartbeat. A normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. In atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute. If you notice an irregular heartbeat and/or have chest pain, see your doctor immediately. How to check your heart rate You can check your heart rate by pressing gently on the pulse in your wrist or neck. As well as a fast and irregular heartbeat, you may also experience: tiredness (inability to carry out  normal exercise for you) breathlessness dizziness feeling faint palpitations chest discomfort or pain Electrocardiogram (ECG) An ECG is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart. Small stickers called electrodes are attached to your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine. Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. An ECG machine traces these signals on paper. An ECG is usually carried out in a hospital or GP surgery. It takes about five minutes and is painless. ","Diagnosing atrial fibrillation Most commonly, the heart rate will be unusually fast with this condition; but it is possible for the heart rate to be within accepted limits or slower and still be in atrial fibrillation. You can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your wrist or neck. A normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. In atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute. How is atrial fibrillation defined? Atrial fibrillation is defined in various ways, depending on how it affects you: and how it’s diagnosed What is the outlook with atrial fibrillation? The exact cause of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown, but it becomes more common with age and affects certain groups of people more than others. People with other heart conditions Atrial fibrillation is common in people with other heart conditions, such as: high blood pressure coronary heart disease heart valve disease congenital heart disease (heart defects at birth) heart failure (from any cause) People with other medical conditions Atrial fibrillation is also associated with other medical conditions such as: hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) heavy alcohol consumption pneumonia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary embolism (a blockage in a blood vessel in your lungs) Cause is unknown Not everyone with atrial fibrillation falls into one of the above groups. Sometimes the cause can be idiopathic (no known cause) and can affect extremely athletic people. Triggers Sometimes there is a trigger to an episode of atrial fibrillation, including: drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, particularly binge drinking being overweight taking illegal drugs, particularly amphetamines or cocaine smoking heightened emotional stress Diagnosing atrial fibrillation ","If you notice your heartbeat is irregular and/or you have chest pain, see your GP straight away. However, it may be difficult to capture an episode, as the irregular rhythm may ‘come and go’, therefore, to capture this your GP or cardiologist, may ask you to wear a small, portable ECG recorder for a longer period of time away from the hospital or GP surgery. Find out more about having an ECG Echocardiogram (Echo) An echocardiogram, sometimes called an echo, is an ultrasound scan of the heart. It can help identify any other heart problems and assess the structure and function of your heart and valves. Find out more about having an echocardiogram Chest X-ray A chest X-ray may be performed and will identify any lung problems that may have caused the atrial fibrillation. Blood tests Blood tests hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). ","Complications of atrial fibrillation About atrial fibrillation persistent atrial fibrillation – this lasts for longer than seven days, or less when it is treated. longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation – this means you have had continuous atrial fibrillation for a year or longer. permanent atrial fibrillation – this is when atrial fibrillation is present all the time and no more attempts to restore normal heart rhythm will be made What happens in atrial fibrillation? When the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, so the heart can fill with blood again. This process is repeated every time the heart beats. Atrial fibrillation occurs when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). This condition increases your risk by about four to five times of having a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke . This is because when the atria in the heart do not contract properly there is a risk of blood clot formation. Clots from the atria may break off and go to other parts of the body. A blood clot passing up to the arteries supplying the brain may cause a stroke. Find out how to treat atrial fibrillation and possible complications of having AF the type of atrial fibrillation age overall health Some people may be treated by their GP, whereas others may be referred to a cardiologist. Finding an underlying cause For example, medication to correct hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) may cure atrial fibrillation. If there is no underlying cause found medicines to control atrial fibrillation restoring a normal heart rhythm medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke cardioversion (a controlled electrical shock to reset the heart rhythm) catheter ablation having a pacemaker fitted You can find out more about each of these below. Medicines to control atrial fibrillation Medicines called anti-arrhythmics can control atrial fibrillation by: restoring a normal heart rhythm controlling the rate at which the heart beats The choice of anti-arrhythmic medicine depends on: the type of atrial fibrillation any other medical conditions you have side effects of the medicine chosen how well the atrial fibrillation responds. Some people with atrial fibrillation may need more than one anti-arrhythmic medicine to control it. Restoring a normal heart rhythm There are a number of drugs that can be used to try to restore a normal heart. The best option for you will be decided by your cardiologist and /or GP. Commonly, these drugs include: flecainide beta-blockers amiodarone Dronedarone may also be used for certain people. It is important you know what side effects to look out for if taking such medication and seek medical advice if you experience any of them. To find out about side effects, read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more details. Medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke The way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation means that there is a risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. If these get into the bloodstream, they can cause a stroke (our complications of atrial fibrillation section has more information on this). Your doctor will assess your risk to minimise your chance of a stroke. They will consider your age and whether you have a history of any of the following: stroke or blood clots heart valve problems heart failure high blood pressure diabetes heart disease You will be classed as having a high, moderate or low risk of a stroke and will be given medication according to your risk. Depending on your level of risk, you may be prescribed warfarin . Anticoagulants Anticoagulants help to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Newer anticoagulants like apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivoroxaban are now more commonly used than warfarin. They do not require dose changes and continuous blood test monitoring. Cardioversion Cardioversion may be tried in some people with atrial fibrillation. The heart is given a controlled electric shock to try to restore a normal rhythm. The procedure normally takes place in hospital with heavy sedation or anaesthetic and careful monitoring. In people who have had atrial fibrillation for more than two days, cardioversion is associated with an increased risk of clot formation. If this is the case, warfarin is given for three to four weeks before cardioversion and for at least four weeks afterwards to minimise the chance of having a stroke. If the cardioversion is successful, warfarin may be stopped. However, some people may need to continue with warfarin if there is a high chance of their atrial fibrillation returning and they have a moderate to high risk of a stroke. Catheter ablation Catheter ablation is a procedure that very carefully interrupts abnormal electrical circuits. It is an option if medication has not been effective or tolerated. Catheters (thin, soft wires) are guided through one of your veins into your heart where they record electrical activity. When the source of the abnormality is found, an energy source (such as high-frequency radiowaves that generate heat) is transmitted through one of the catheters to destroy the tissue. This procedure commonly takes two to three hours, so it may be done under general anaesthetic , where you are put to sleep. Find out more about catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation on the Arrhythmia Alliance website Having a pacemaker fitted A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that is implanted in your chest, just below your collarbone. It will not cure, reverse or actively treat your atrial fibrillation. A pacemaker provides beats where your heart is not supplying its own. If your heart beat is very slow the pacemaker will override this and pace at a set rate. If there are significant pauses between your heart beats beats, the pacemaker will supply a beat, acting as a ‘safety net’. Having a pacemaker fitted is usually a minor surgical procedure performed under a local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). Complications of atrial fibrillation When the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, do not pump efficiently then there is a risk of blood clots forming. These blood clots may move into the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, and get pumped into the blood supply to the lungs or the general blood circulation. Stroke Clots in the general circulation can block arteries in the brain, causing a stroke . The risk of a stroke in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) is four to five times greater than the general population. However, the risk depends on a number of factors, including age, whether you have high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes and a previous history of blood clots. Heart failure If your atrial fibrillation is persistent, it may start to weaken your heart muscle. In extreme cases, it can lead to heart failure , where your heart cannot pump blood around your body as efficiently as before. ",

Read more about the However, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections. self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers Search for a pharmacy near you Atopic eczema isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required. Read more about Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults. The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching. Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work. Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It’s not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old inflammation and will eventually return to its normal colour. Atopic eczema often occurs on the insides of the elbows. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Atopic eczema can occur on the face. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Signs of an infection Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include: your eczema getting a lot worse fluid oozing from the skin a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema the skin becoming swollen and sore a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected. Read more about infections and other complications of atopic eczema . Common triggers include: irritants – such as soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid and bubble bath environmental factors or allergens – such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds food allergies – such as allergies to cows’ milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat certain materials worn next to the skin – such as wool and synthetic fabrics skin infections diagnosing atopic eczema . Diagnosing atopic eczema These questions may include asking: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears whether it comes and goes over time whether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma You should tell your pharmacist or GP if your condition is affecting your quality of life – for example, if you have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or your eczema limits your everyday activities. Checklist for diagnosing atopic eczema Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4) Establishing triggers Your pharmacist should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse. Allergy tests Read more about Try to reduce the damage from scratching Eczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur. It may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods. If your GP suspects you have a food allergy , you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you’re allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need. Alternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician. If you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet. Emollients To apply the emollient: use a large amount don’t rub it in – smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in You should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin. During a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid as emollients used on their own are not enough to control it. Don’t put your fingers into an emollient pot – use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people. Topical corticosteroids If your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days. Topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected. They can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone). Antihistamines Antihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema. They can either be sedating, which cause drowsiness, or non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating antihistamine. Sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child’s school know they may not be as alert as normal. Bandages and wet wraps In some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema. These can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out. Corticosteroid tablets Corticosteroid tablets are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5 to 7 days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control. You should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected. They will usually prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules or cream to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled. areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin a high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some cases Contact your doctor immediately if you think you or your child may have eczema herpeticum. If you cannot contact your GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital. If you are diagnosed with eczema herpeticum, you will be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir. Psychological effects As well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically. Preschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who do not have the condition. They are also more likely to be more dependent on their parents. Bullying Schoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with. Your child may become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child’s teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling. The National Eczema Society provides information about regional support groups , where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema. Problems sleeping Sleep-related problems are common among people with eczema. A lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work. If your child has problems sleeping because of their eczema, they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It might help to let their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration. During a severe eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies. Self-confidence Atopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may lead to them having a poor self-image. If your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child’s self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance. Speak to your GP if you are concerned your child’s eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support. ","Diagnosing atopic eczema Atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, but the most common areas to be affected are: backs or fronts of the knees outside or inside of the elbows around the neck hands cheeks scalp Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it’s clear it’s not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get allergies – “atopic” means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever . . Atopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things. People with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain much moisture. This dryness may make the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy. You may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents. Research has shown children who have 1 or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves. Atopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact. Eczema triggers . Try to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin. Keep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching. Avoid triggers Your pharmacist will work with you to establish what might trigger the eczema flare-ups, although it may get better or worse for no obvious reason. Once you know your triggers, you can try to avoid them. For example: if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin – use soap substitutes instead Although some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn’t recommended as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps.

It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults. topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups When to get professional advice and the complications of atopic eczema . Who is affected? About 1 in 5 children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. Many children develop it before their first birthday. Atopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve by the age of 16. However, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults. emollients (moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry topical corticosteroids – creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups Self care In addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have. Choosing an emollient Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your pharmacist will be able to recommend another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day. How to use emollients How to use topical corticosteroids Most people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often. When using a topical corticosteroid: apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night) apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated Occasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed to help prevent flare-ups. Side effects Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause: thinning of the skin – especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks) acne (spots) – especially when used on the face in teenagers increased hair growth Seeing a specialist A dermatologist may be able to offer the following: topical calcineurin inhibitors – creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus very strong topical corticosteroids bandages or wet wraps phototherapy – ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation immunosuppressant tablets – to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate alitretinoin – medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults Complications of atopic eczema People with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems.

Asbestosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis/,About asbestosis ,"shortness of breath – this may only occur after physical activity at first, but it can eventually become a more constant problem a persistent cough wheezing fatigue (extreme tiredness) chest pain in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips Nowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace. Read more about diagnosing asbestosis . lung cancer in people with asbestosis. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure – usually over many years – to relatively high numbers of asbestosis fibres is necessary. Occupations associated with asbestos exposure The use of asbestos increased significantly after World War II. It peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period. Occupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period include: insulation workers boilermakers plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters shipyard workers sheet metal workers plasterers chemical technicians heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics Now that asbestos is no longer used, those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers, electricians and demolition workers. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website has further information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure. Diagnosing asbestosis If your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in. Your GP will also ask about your work history, particularly about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working. Referral to a specialist If asbestosis is suspected, you will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include: a chest X-ray – to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the lungs – which produces more detailed images of the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities lung function tests – to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstream Not smoking If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it’s very important to stop as soon as possible. lung cancer at a later stage. Speak to your GP for help with giving up smoking. They can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. Your GP can also put you in touch with local support groups in your area. You can also phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking. Read more about stopping smoking . Vaccinations If you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection. It’s recommended that you have the influenza (flu) vaccination to protect against flu , and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such as pneumonia . Your GP can arrange for you to have these vaccinations. You will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. Most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor. Long-term oxygen therapy If you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all the oxygen it needs to function properly. Oxygen therapy may be recommended if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air. This oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula). You may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you’re out of the house. This is known as ambulatory oxygen. It’s very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. This is because high concentrations of oxygen are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion. Medication Most people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . More severe cases may benefit from medicines, such as small doses of morphine to reduce breathlessness and a cough . Serious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. The most common problem is constipation , and a laxative will usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools. Preventing asbestosis Although asbestos is no longer widely used in the UK, it’s still important to take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure, because it’s still found in many old buildings. Strict regulations were introduced in 1970 to regulate the use of asbestos in the workplace. However, the import, supply and use of brown (amosite) and blue (crocidolite) asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1985. White asbestos (chrysotile) was banned in 1999, except for a small number of specialist uses of the material. This means that buildings that were built or refurbished before the year 2000 could still contain asbestos. Asbestos in your home If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. In these circumstances, it may be best to leave any asbestos-containing materials where they are – especially if they are in good condition and unlikely to get damaged. You should check the condition of the materials from time to time to make sure they haven’t been damaged or started to deteriorate. Slightly damaged asbestos-containing materials can sometimes be repaired by sealing or enclosing them. However, this should only be done by someone with the necessary training. Any badly-damaged asbestos material that cannot be protected should be removed by someone who is appropriately trained. Your local environmental health officer can advise you about this. If you are planning any home improvements, repairs or maintenance, and you intend to bring in any additional workers or contractors, you should inform them of any asbestos materials in your home before they start work. This will help reduce the risks of any asbestos-containing material being disturbed. You can search for who to contact about asbestos in your home on the GOV.UK website. Asbestos in your workplace If your job doesn’t directly put you at risk of asbestos exposure, but you are concerned about asbestos in your workplace, speak to the building duty holder about what they are doing to monitor and manage the situation. A duty holder is someone who is responsible for maintaining and repairing non-domestic premises. If any asbestos-containing materials in your workplace are assessed as being in good condition, and not in a position where they are likely to be damaged, they will usually be left in place and monitored. However, asbestos-containing materials that are in a poor condition or are likely to be damaged during the normal use of the building should be sealed, enclosed or removed as appropriate. Working with asbestos If your job means that you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure the appropriate precautions are taken before and during any work you do. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has drawn up the following checklist for employers, managers and traders to go through before carrying out work on a building that may contain asbestos: Identify whether asbestos is present and determine its type and condition – this may mean checking with the building manager or having the area surveyed. Carry out a risk assessment to determine whether it’s possible to carry out the work, while avoiding the risk of asbestos exposure completely. Decide if the work needs to be carried out by a licensed contractor – the removal of certain types of asbestos-containing material will need to be done by a contractor holding a licence from the HSE. If the work is not licensable, decide if the work needs to be notified – some jobs require the relevant enforcing authority to be notified of what you are doing Ensure that those carrying out the work are suitably trained – any worker who may disturb asbestos during their daily work needs to receive appropriate training, so that they can protect themselves and others. Steps that may help reduce your exposure to asbestos during your work include wearing protective equipment (such as a suitable face mask), cleaning up as you go (using a vacuum cleaner or wet rags, rather than sweeping) and not using power tools whenever possible. Want to know more? The HSE website has more information about: managing and working with asbestos dos and don’ts when working with asbestos task sheets outlining how to carry out non-licensed work with asbestos You may also find it useful to read the Control of Asbestos Regulations (2012), which outline the measures that should be in place to reduce the risk of asbestos exposure. Read the full Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (PDF, 143 KB) . ","Diagnosing asbestosis . Compensation If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through: industrial injuries disablement benefit – this is a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed) a civil claim for compensation through the courts – you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this a claim for a lump compensation sum under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979 – if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven’t been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading Read more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website . Preventing asbestosis There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these – called crocidolite and amosite – were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999. However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings. It’s therefore important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos. If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself. If your job means you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely. Read about preventing asbestosis . Who is affected Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years. However, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012. Asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past. What is asbestos? Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. Materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant. There were three main types of asbestos in commercial use: crocidolite (‘blue asbestos’) amosite (‘brown asbestos’) chrysotile (‘white asbestos’) All these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air. No crocidolite was imported into the UK after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). Chrysotile was not banned until 1999. This means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. How asbestos fibres affect the lungs When you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream. However, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. In an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. This scarring is what is known as asbestosis. rheumatoid arthritis . ",,"Preventing asbestosis About asbestosis Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction. Asbestos can be very dangerous. It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres. When the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure. Read more about the There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs. One of the most important things someone with the condition can do is to stop smoking Read more about . Outlook The outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present. Asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person’s health and shorten their life expectancy, but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all. However, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: pleural disease – where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort mesothelioma – a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut lung cancer ",
Arthritis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/arthritis/,About arthritis Living with arthritis About arthritis ,"The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis . Oligo-articular JIA Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body – most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there’s a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended. Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis) Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood. . The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. Systemic onset JIA Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone. ","In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children (see below). Types of arthritis The two most common types of arthritis are: osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people. It most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. It’s also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hips Rheumatoid arthritis In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men. Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body’s immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint’s shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. Other types of arthritis and related conditions Ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. Cervical spondylosis – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. Fibromyalgia Lupus – an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body’s tissues. Gout Psoriatic arthritis – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis . Enteropathic arthritis – a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease . About one in five people with Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. Reactive arthritis – this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through). It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. Secondary arthritis – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. Polymyalgia rheumatica ","joint pain, tenderness and stiffness inflammation in and around the joints restricted movement of the joints warm, red skin over the affected joint weakness and muscle wasting Arthritis and children Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis. ","For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: painkillers non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: arthroplasty (joint replacement) arthodesis (joint fusion) osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned) analgesics (painkillers) physiotherapy regular exercise Read more about how rheumatoid arthritis is treated . Living with arthritis Living with arthritis isn’t easy and carrying out simple, everyday tasks can often be painful and difficult. However, there are many things you can do to make sure you live a healthy lifestyle. A range of services and benefits are also available. Work Many people with arthritis want to continue working for many reasons, including better financial security and higher self-esteem. You may find work challenging, but your employer should help you with the training and support you need. Help is also available if your arthritis is so severe that you’re unable to work. Find out more about the Personal Independence Payment (formerly known as the Disability Living Allowance). Healthy eating It’s very important to eat a healthy, balanced diet if you have arthritis. Eating healthily will give you all the nutrients you need and help you maintain a healthy weight. Your diet should consist of a variety of foods from all 5 food groups. These are: fruit and vegetables starchy foods – like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta meat, fish, eggs and beans milk and dairy foods foods containing fat and sugar Further information about how to have a healthy, balanced diet . Weight If you’re overweight, losing weight can really help you cope with arthritis. Too much weight places excess pressure on the joints in your hips, knees, ankles and feet, leading to increased pain and mobility problems. Further information about how you can lose weight. Exercise If your arthritis is painful, you may not feel like exercising. However, being active can help reduce and prevent pain. Regular exercise can also: improve your range of movement and joint mobility increase muscle strength reduce stiffness boost your energy As long as you do the right type and level of exercise for your condition, your arthritis won’t get any worse. Combined with a healthy, balanced diet (see above), regular exercise will help you lose weight and place less strain on your joints. Your GP can advise about the type and level of exercise that’s right for you. Versus Arthritis also has further information about exercising with arthritis . Joint care If you have arthritis, it’s important to look after your joints so there’s no further damage. For example, try to reduce the stress on your joints while carrying out everyday tasks like moving and lifting. Some tips for protecting your joints, particularly if you have arthritis, include: use larger, stronger joints as levers – for example, take the pressure of opening a heavy door on your shoulder rather than on your hand use several joints to spread the weight of an object – for example, use both hands to carry your shopping or distribute the weight evenly in a shoulder bag or rucksack don’t grip too tightly – grip as loosely as possible or use a padded handle to widen your grip It’s also important to avoid sitting in the same position for long periods of time and to take regular breaks so you can move around. At home If you have arthritis, carrying out tasks around the home can be a challenge. However, making some practical changes to your home and changing the way you work should make things easier. Practical tips that could help include: keeping things in easy reach using a hand rail to help you get up and down the stairs using long-handled tools to pick things up or to clean fitting levers to taps to make them easier to turn using electric kitchen equipment, like tin openers, when preparing food Versus Arthritis has further information and tips for living with arthritis . Occupational therapy An occupational therapist can help if you have severe arthritis that’s affecting your ability to move around your home and carry out everyday tasks, like cooking and cleaning. They can advise about equipment you may need to help you live independently. Depending on the exact nature of your condition, your GP may be able to refer you to an NHS occupational therapist. However, you may need to access this type of therapy through your local council. Find your local council Further information about occupational therapy .

Asthma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asthma/,About asthma ,"and diagnosing asthma The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition. Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people. Read more about the For most people, this will involve the occasional – or, more commonly, daily – use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important. Read more about For children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on. wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe) shortness of breath a tight chest – which may feel like a band is tightening around it coughing Read our page on the Asthma attacks Asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action. You might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. Read about diagnosing asthma for more information. Signs of a particularly severe asthma attack can include: wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep breathing faster a rapid heartbeat feeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy your lips or fingers turning blue (cyanosis) respiratory tract infections – particularly infections affecting the upper airways, such as colds and the flu allergens – including pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers airborne irritants – including cigarette smoke, chemical fumes and atmospheric pollution medicines – particularly the class of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , which includes aspirin and ibuprofen , and beta-blockers sometimes given for high blood pressure or some types of heart disease emotions – including stress or laughing foods containing sulphites – naturally occurring substances found in some food and drinks, such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals weather conditions – including a sudden change in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms, poor air quality and hot, humid days indoor conditions – including mould or damp, house dust mites and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials exercise food allergies – including allergies to nuts or other food items Once you know your asthma triggers, you may be able to help control your condition by trying to avoid them. Further information Asthma UK: asthma triggers A-Z Occupational asthma In some cases, asthma is associated with substances you may be exposed to at work. This is known as “occupational asthma”. Your GP may also ask whether you have any allergic (atopic) conditions such as eczema and hay fever , which often occur alongside asthma. Spirometry A breathing test called spirometry will often be carried out to assess how well your lungs work. This involves taking a deep breath and exhaling as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer. The spirometer takes two measurements – the volume of air you can breathe out in the first second of exhalation (the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (the forced vital capacity or FVC). You may be asked to breathe into the spirometer a few times to get an accurate reading. The readings are then compared with average measurements for people your age, sex and height, which can show if your airways are obstructed. Sometimes an initial set of measurements is taken, and you are then given a medicine to open up your airways (a reliever inhaler) to see if this improves your breathing when another reading is taken. This is known as reversibility testing, and it can be useful in distinguishing asthma from other lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . Peak expiratory flow test A small hand-held device known as a peak flow meter can be used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. This is your peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the test is usually called a peak flow test. This test requires a bit of practise to get it right, so your GP or nurse will show you how to do it and may suggest you take the best of two or three readings. You may be given a peak flow meter to take home and a diary to record measurements of your peak flow over a period of weeks. This is because asthma is variable and your lung function may change throughout the day. The test often involves inhaling progressively increasing amounts of the medication at intervals, with spirometry measurement of FEV1 in between to see if it falls below a certain threshold. In some cases, however, exercise may be used as a trigger. Testing airway inflammation It may also be useful in some cases to carry out tests to check for inflammation in your airways. This can be done in two main ways: a mucus sample – the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm) so it can be tested for signs of inflammation in the airways nitric oxide concentration – as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine; a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of airway inflammation Allergy tests Skin testing or a blood test can be used to confirm whether your asthma is associated with specific allergies, such as dust mites, pollen or foods. Tests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to certain substances known to cause occupational asthma. Read more about diagnosing allergies The inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again. Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused. The preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone. Some inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk. Smoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers. Read further information: Asthma UK: preventer inhalers These work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover. Regular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours. You should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself. In view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a ‘combination’ inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device. Examples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon. Other preventer medicines leukotriene receptor antagonists – tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways theophyllines – tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents Oral steroids Read further information: In most cases, the following actions will be recommended: Take one to two puffs of your reliever inhaler (usually blue) immediately. Sit down and try to take slow, steady breaths. If you do not start to feel better, take two puffs of your reliever inhaler (one puff at a time) every two minutes (you can take up to 10 puffs) – this is easier using a spacer, if you have one. If you do not feel better after taking your inhaler as above or if you are worried at any time, phone 999. If an ambulance does not arrive within 10 minutes and you are still feeling unwell, repeat step three. If you are admitted to hospital, you will be given a combination of oxygen, reliever and preventer medicines to bring your asthma under control. Your personal asthma action plan will need to be reviewed after an asthma attack, so reasons for the attack can be identified and avoided in future. Read further information: Asthma UK: what to do in an asthma attack Personal asthma action plan As part of your initial assessment, you should be encouraged to draw up a personal asthma action plan with your GP or asthma nurse.

Diet Most people with asthma can eat a normal, healthy diet. Occasionally, people with asthma may have food-based allergic triggers and will need to avoid foods such as cows’ milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, yeast products, nuts, and some food colourings and preservatives. However, this is uncommon. Read more about eating well Read further information: Asthma UK: exercise Asthma UK: diet and food Know your triggers Read our page on the Read further information: Often, people who die from asthma do so at home because they do not recognise when their condition is getting worse or leave it too long to take action. Do not let this happen to you. Be confident in recognising deterioration of your asthma and what action to take. Take action promptly – never ignore severe asthma. Asthma and pregnancy It’s important to ensure your condition is well controlled during pregnancy, because poorly controlled asthma can lead to complications such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth and restricted growth of the baby in the womb. Good asthma control also minimises the chance of problems during labour and delivery. You should manage your asthma in the same way you did before you were pregnant. The medicines used for asthma – particularly those that are inhaled – are generally considered to be safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding your child. The one exception is leukotriene receptor antagonists. These are not known to be harmful, but there is insufficient experience of their use in pregnancy to be absolutely certain. If, however, you do need to take leukotriene receptor antagonists to control your asthma, you may decide (in discussion with your GP or asthma clinic and obstetrician) that you should carry on taking them and that the potential risks to you and your child from uncontrolled asthma are likely to be far higher than any potential risk from this medicine. Read further information: Asthma UK: pregnancy Asthma at school Most children with well-controlled asthma can learn and participate in school activities completely unaffected by their condition. However, it is important to ensure the school has up-to-date written information about your child’s asthma medicines, how much they take, and when they need to take them. Your child’s school should have an asthma policy in place, which you can ask to see. Read further information: Asthma UK: your child at school Financial support Depending on how severely asthma affects you on a daily basis, you may be entitled to some benefits, such as: Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) – a benefit paid to people who are not able to work because of ill health or disability Attendance Allowance – a benefit for help with the extra costs you may have if you’re 65 or over and have a physical or mental disability, and need someone to help look after you Read further information: GOV.UK: benefits Asthma UK: financial help Occupational asthma If you develop asthma because of your work, and this is fully documented by your doctor and your employer, you can make a claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit from the Benefits Agency. This is a weekly amount paid to people with asthma caused by exposure to a specific substance through their work and is known to be associated with asthma (a complete list is available from the Health and Safety Executive ). ","Diagnosing asthma Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal. When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs – known as a trigger – your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). Common asthma triggers include: house dust mites animal fur pollen cigarette smoke exercise viral infections Who is affected? for more information about potential triggers. Some of these may be genetic. However, a number of environmental factors are thought to play a role in the development of asthma. These include air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards (known as the ‘hygiene hypothesis’). There is currently not enough evidence to be certain whether any of these can cause asthma, although a variety of environmental irritants, such as dust, cold air and smoke, may make it worse. Who is at risk? Although the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. These include: a family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema, food allergy or hay fever having another atopic condition having bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy being born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth having a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job. Asthma triggers In people with asthma, the small tubes (bronchi) that carry air in and out of the lungs become inflamed and more sensitive than normal. This means that when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs (a trigger), your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). isocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint) flour and grain dust colophony (a substance often found in solder fumes) latex animals wood dust You may be at an increased risk of developing occupational asthma if you are regularly exposed to substances such as these through your work. Occupations that are commonly associated with the condition include paint sprayers, bakers and pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, food processing workers and timber workers.

","Living with asthma About asthma Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. Read more about the That’s the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men. How asthma is treated and living with asthma Outlook For many people, asthma is a long-term condition – particularly if it first develops in adulthood. Reliever inhalers Everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a ‘reliever’. Read further information: Asthma UK: relievers Preventer inhalers Preventer inhalers – usually brown, red or orange – work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring. They must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control. Long-acting reliever inhalers Oral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways: to regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset – for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped Omalizumab (Xolair) Omalizumab, also known as Xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. This lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack. It is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma. Asthma UK: steroid tablets NICE: omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthma Bronchial thermoplasty Bronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure that can be used in some cases of severe asthma. It works by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can reduce their ability to narrow the airways. The procedure is carried out either with sedation or under general anaesthetic . A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose so it touches the airways. There is some evidence to show this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma. However, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission. Read further information: NICE: bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma Side effects of relievers and preventers Relievers are a safe and effective medicine, and have few side effects as long as they are not used too much. The main side effects include a mild shaking of the hands (tremors), headaches and muscle cramps. These usually only happen with high doses of reliever inhaler and usually only last for a few minutes. Preventers are very safe at usual doses, although they can cause a range of side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use. The main side effect of preventer inhalers is a fungal infection of the mouth or throat (oral candidiasis) . You may also develop a hoarse voice and sore throat . Using a spacer can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after using your preventer inhaler. Your doctor or nurse will discuss with you the need to balance control of your asthma with the risk of side effects, and how to keep side effects to a minimum. Side effects of add-on therapy Theophylline tablets have been known to cause side effects in some people, including nausea, vomiting, tremors and noticeable heartbeats (palpitations). These can usually be avoided by adjusting the dose according to periodic measurement of the theophylline concentration in the blood. Side effects of leukotriene receptor agonists can include tummy (abdominal) pain and headaches. Side effects of steroid tablets Oral steroids carry a risk if they are taken for more than three months or if they are taken frequently (more than three or four courses of steroids a year). Side effects can include: osteoporosis (fragile bones) high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes increased appetite, leading to weight gain cataracts and glaucoma (eye disorders) thinning of the skin easy bruising muscle weakness With the exception of increased appetite, which is very commonly experienced by people taking oral steroids, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon. However, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for them regularly, especially side effects that are not immediately obvious, such as high blood pressure, thinning of the bones, diabetes and glaucoma. You will need regular appointments to check for these.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/autism-spectrum-disorder-asd/,"About autism Characteristics of autism Diagnosing autism Living with autism Facts and myths about autism About autism Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually called autism, is something you’re born with. Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you. Read more about characteristics of autism here Autism is highly variable – the word ‘spectrum’ refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. Autism is considered a spectrum because it’s different for every autistic person – some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. The way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments. Read more about support here Talking about autism Many people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term ‘autistic’ to describe themselves – this is known as identity-first language (for example, “I’m autistic”). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated. For a long time people used the term ‘person on the autism spectrum’, known as person-first language (for example, “I’m on the autism spectrum”), and some people still prefer this. In this guide, we’ll mostly use the term ‘autistic’. If in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they’d prefer. In the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including: Asperger’s Syndrome autistic disorder Kanner’s Syndrome childhood autism atypical autism Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Because these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism for short. People also use the term ‘autism spectrum condition’ (ASC). Learn more about autism from autistic people How common is autism? At least 1 in 100 people in Scotland are autistic. Currently, between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 people diagnosed with autism are assigned female at birth (AFAB). Read more about autism and gender Autism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children. ",,"The exact cause of autism is unknown, but researchers think it’s at least partly genetic – that autism can run in the family. However, autism can also develop when there’s no family history. There’s no way to predict whether a child will be autistic, even if one or both of their parents are autistic. More research is being done to find out which genes cause autism – it’s thought to be caused by more than one. Living with autism Like everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment – however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person. Autism doesn’t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. However, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don’t have them. Therapies for autistic people There’s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn’t want to be ‘cured’ even if it was possible. Many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated. Related conditions These things do not cause autism: bad parenting vaccines, or any ingredients in vaccines trauma or distress at a young age diet infections ","Read more about characteristics of autism Characteristics of autism Every autistic person is different and has different experiences. However, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people. The way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you’re in. For example: the way you use language and talk might be different to most people you may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people making and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you you may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not you might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently autistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers you may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes you might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time – these interests can change throughout your life you might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly there might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can’t be around due to their texture or smell when working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole – you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else’s part while autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects autistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up you might find you’re always determined to make sure things are ‘perfect’, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you’re working on something it can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn’t clear communication about what they’re expected to do There are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic. Read more about diagnosing autism here Autism and gender At the moment, men and those assigned male at birth are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth. Autism and environment Some environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. Every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are: social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’ on things like who speaks when – for example, parties and nights out busy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at once Many environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. When autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they’re likely to: feel more relaxed perform better at tasks find it easier to learn use less time and energy trying to fit in with their environment Because every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. It may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid. If there’s an autistic person in your life, it’s important to ask them what they’d prefer and if there’s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them. If you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they’re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. Autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don’t enjoy. Read more about finding the right environment Diagnosing autism The signs of autism can be different depending on the person and how old they are. Because autism is present from birth, it can usually be diagnosed in childhood. However, it may only be recognised later in life. Understanding of autism has grown over time, so more people are now being diagnosed when they’re older if the signs weren’t recognised when they were children. It’s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren’t caused by autism. If you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your GP or health visitor. Signs of autism in children The signs of autism can change as children grow – babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older. Babies and toddlers Signs of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour. Talking and showing emotions Autistic babies and toddlers might: start talking later than most children seem less aware of others around them – for example, they might not respond to their name being called make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedly Autistic babies and toddlers might not: smile back when you smile at them point to show when they want something point to show you something they find interesting share when they’re feeling happy – for example, they might be having fun playing, but they might not turn around and smile at you Playing Autistic babies and toddlers might: spend a long time setting up toys in a certain way, and set them up the same way every time enjoy lining toys up in order, or watching parts of them move Autistic babies and toddlers might not: seem interested in playing with other children their age seem to use their toys to make up stories or pretend – they might also start pretend play at a later age than most children Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes) Autistic babies and toddlers might: react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, if they like the way a stuffed toy feels, they want to spend a lot of time stroking the toy become upset if given something to eat or drink that’s new to them eat a limited range of foods Children aged 4 and up As children grow and experience different environments, such as nursery and school, the characteristics of autism can appear differently. Communicating Autistic children might: speak differently to most children – for example, they might use an unusual accent, talk slowly or quickly compared to others, speak in a ‘flat’ tone that doesn’t change, or use a ‘sing-song’ voice use longer or more complicated words than most children, even in relaxed situations struggle to ask other people questions about themselves find it hard to keep a conversation going Relationships Autistic children might: show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest them, but experience significant difficulty when talking about other people’s interests find it difficult to make and keep friends want to play with other children, but find it hard to ask if they can join in have 1 or 2 good friends that they spend a lot of time with spend free time, such as school break times, by themselves find it hard to tell the difference between someone being friendly or joking and someone trying to bully them or hurt their feelings get on better with adults than other children their age get on better with children who are younger or older than them spend time with a group of children, but find it hard to join in with other children’s play, and so spend a lot of time on the edge of the group have friends at school, but show little to no interest in seeing them outside of school Different situations and routine Autistic children might: accidentally make social mistakes, for example correcting a teacher about classroom rules find some social situations, like parties or busy places, overwhelming and difficult to cope with be passive around other children or adults, agreeing to everything and doing everything people ask often tell others what to do, including while playing struggle with social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’, such as free play or school break times find it difficult to cope with changes to their routine, especially if the change is unexpected – for example, having a different teacher for a day or having plans change due to bad weather Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes) Autistic children might: react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, being unable to cope with seams in their socks or the noises in supermarkets find certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes particularly calming or enjoyable – for example, coloured lights or being tucked tightly into bed make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedly Signs of autism in teenagers and adults The characteristics of autism can affect you differently as you get older – you may also recognise some of the signs of autism in children in yourself as an adult. Many people are diagnosed with autism as teenagers or adults based on noticing that they think and behave differently from most other people. Signs of autism in teenagers As you age and experience different environments, you might notice different signs of autism. Communicating As an autistic teenager, you might: find it hard to be understood in conversations, find it hard to work out when to talk in conversations – you might never get to say what you want to say, or find yourself talking over other people find it easier to communicate with other autistic people be able to talk for a long time about the subjects that particularly interest you show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest you, but experience significant difficulty when trying to talk about other people’s interests be able to answer other people’s questions, but struggle to know what questions to ask or how to answer when someone tells you something about themselves find other people say you use a lot of long words, or use longer or more complicated words than most people often use the same phrases when you’re talking struggle with hidden meanings when other people are talking to you – it might be difficult for you to understand a ‘hint’, or notice when someone is flirting with you find people can take the wrong meaning from your words or behaviour – for example, if you make a lot of eye contact, they might think you’re flirting with them Behaviour and different situations As an autistic teenager, you might: find eye contact uncomfortable, or struggle to know how much eye contact to use do well when you’re in your routine, but find it difficult when routines change – changes might make you feel anxious, make it hard to concentrate, or mean you have to work harder on things it’d normally be easy to do struggle to imagine things that you haven’t experienced before – for example, if you’re going to a party for the first time, it might be hard for you to imagine what will happen and what you’ll be expected to do find yourself making social mistakes without realising why – for example, during conversations you might not realise there are things other people would rather not talk about, or don’t think are important to talk about Learning and hobbies As an autistic teenager, you might: have a lot of knowledge on particular topics, and spend a lot of time learning about them and telling others about them have a hobby you feel very passionate about and spend a lot of time on find it hard to start a new activity but get very focused on it once you get started – you might be able to focus on it better than most people find it difficult to stop doing an activity you’re very focused on, even if you need to move on to something else – you might forget to eat or sleep Emotions and relationships As an autistic teenager, you might: spend a lot of time being careful to avoid making social mistakes, or trying to make sure you don’t accidentally hurt anyone’s feelings find that other people struggle to understand your feelings from your face or tone of voice find that your friends are often older or younger than you find that your friends tend to be autistic people have to ask people to explain idioms (phrases that say one thing, when they’re actually talking about something else), for example: “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it”, which means “we’ll talk about that problem later” have a clear idea of right and wrong, and strong views on issues that are important to you – you might struggle to understand exceptions to rules, or ‘grey areas’ find a lot of people don’t understand your sense of humour, and you might not understand why their jokes are funny be trusting, and find people can often take advantage of you find it hard to work out when someone is being unkind Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes) As an autistic teenager, you might: have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like gyms have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying flashing, multi-coloured lights in nightclubs or how loud the music is at a concert seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyable Signs of autism in adults As you age and experience different environments, life events, and circumstances, you might notice different signs of autism. You might also have developed coping strategies for environments you find difficult, changing the way you manage them. Work and education As an autistic adult, you might: find it more difficult than most people to communicate in interviews – for example, talking about your skills – which can make it hard to get a job find it more difficult than most people to keep a job – you may be good at your work, but it might be hard to have good relationships with colleagues and managers have a lot of knowledge or feel very passionate about a subject that’s useful for your work or studies find it difficult or frustrating when rules or ways of doing things don’t make sense to you find it more difficult than most people would to work on a project or task that has unclear instructions for how to complete it Relationships and being social As an autistic adult, you might: find socialising hard work – when others seem to have a lot of energy after meeting a group of friends, for example, you might feel exhausted have had relationships with friends or partners end because you couldn’t understand how each other thought, behaved, and communicated find dating challenging prefer to be alone during breaks at work find it difficult to make ‘small talk’ – meaning conversation about day-to-day things such as the weather – or understand the reasons for making small talk enjoy spending time with other people, but find activities that don’t have clear ‘rules’ or a schedule – for example, going to parties or nightclubs – difficult because you aren’t sure what to do prefer meeting up with people to do structured activities, like cooking or taking part in a shared hobby or interest Hobbies and skills As an autistic adult, you might: have a lot of detailed knowledge about a particular topic or hobby and feel very passionate about it find that the hobbies or topics you’re particularly passionate about have changed several times in your life Communication and emotions As an autistic adult, you might: find other people often misunderstand you, or seem upset by things you say even if you don’t mean to upset them find it hard to understand why people around you see a situation one way, and not the way you understand it find change more difficult than most people do – things that disrupt your daily routine, like changes to your job or going on holiday, can make you feel stressed and anxious Sensory (sights, smells, sounds, touch, and tastes) As an autistic adult, you might: have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like busy buses or trains have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying lying under a weighted blanket, or the loudness of the music at a concert seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyable Autistic traits – meaning things that autistic people often do, think, and feel – are often shared by people who don’t have autism too. This doesn’t mean that everyone is ‘a little bit autistic’, or that autistic people don’t need support. To be diagnosed with autism, a person has to have a lot of autistic traits from birth, and those traits need to have a big effect on their life. In order to be diagnosed with autism, those traits must cause what a healthcare professional would call ‘clinically significant difficulties’ in their day-to-day life. This means that they have difficulties with day-to-day life due to their autistic traits and need to use their own ways of overcoming those difficulties, or the people in their life need to help them to overcome them, or both. Being in a supportive environment makes a big difference to an autistic person’s wellbeing and quality of life. Learn more about how autism is diagnosed Other health conditions People who have these conditions can be more likely to also have autism: developmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or learning disability muscular dystrophy Down’s syndrome cerebral palsy epilepsy neurofibromatosis – a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2) rare genetic conditions, including fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome ","low mood anxiety sleep problems Psychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are often used to treat depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, both in people who have autism and people who don’t. Challenges in daily living Depending on what’s offered by your NHS board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience. Possible therapies include: help with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives groups for autistic people to share experiences and advice sensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world training courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible support Finding the right therapies Interventions that aim to ‘train out’ behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. However, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience – this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour. For example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills. These therapies don’t aim to change a person’s autism, but to give them skills they can use. If you’re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. If you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs. Learn about avoiding harmful and unhelpful therapies for autism Autism and your environment Sometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed. Meltdowns and shutdowns When an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn’t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have ‘meltdowns’ or ‘shutdowns’. It’s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn’t a tantrum. A tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. A meltdown or shutdown isn’t something an autistic person can control, and it’s caused by being overwhelmed. During a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. This can include doing things like: trying to get away from people – for example by running away or hiding trying to get people away from them – for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressively During a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out – for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them. Read more about meltdowns Challenging behaviour Like everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they’re in the wrong environment. While it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating. Behaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don’t have any other way to do so. It’s not ‘bad’ behaviour, or intended to cause harm. This kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs – for example, people with a learning disability. If you’re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges. If someone in your life is autistic, or you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there’s effective support for everyone involved. Behaviour that challenges can also be caused by: trying to meet sensory needs – for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls wanting something – for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy needing assistance or attention – for example, because they’re bored or want help with a project at school trying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the road Behaviour that people can find challenging includes: being destructive – breaking things, for example being disruptive – making noise in class or throwing things, for example self-harm aggression Help is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. Finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. Contact your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you for advice. Getting the right environment Environment is important to quality of life for autistic people. There are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child. The social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. These barriers can be physical – for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. Barriers can also be caused by people’s attitudes – for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don’t make eye contact while talking. The social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them. Learn more about the social model of disability Autism is covered by the Equality Act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make “reasonable adjustments” to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work. Learn more about the Equality Act (2010) Common changes to an environment that can help autistic people include: sensory changes – for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working communication changes – for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words routine – keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possible Every autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes – the best way to find the right ones is to ask an autistic person, or in the case of a child, their parents or caregivers.

This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin. Angioedema can cause swelling in any part of the body, including the lips. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Angioedema can cause swelling around the eye. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Why does angioedema happen? The cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4 main types of angioedema: allergic angioedema – the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with anaphylaxis drug-induced angioedema – the swelling is a side effect of certain medications, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors hereditary angioedema – the swelling is caused by “faulty” genes that are inherited from a person’s parents Read more about the However, further tests, such as blood tests or allergy tests, may be required to determine the type of angioedema. Idiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found. Read more about diagnosing angioedema . How is angioedema treated? The main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin’s surface. Swollen skin The swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin. It most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below). The swelling usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1 to 3 days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible. The swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop urticaria (hives) , which is red and itchy. Swelling caused by angioedema often affects the hands and feet. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ a hot or painful sensation in the swollen areas swelling of the inside of the throat, the windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects vision People with hereditary angioedema may also experience: abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine When to seek medical advice Contact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have. When to seek emergency medical advice Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) . Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis. a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to breathing problems swelling of the tongue and throat If you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Drug-induced angioedema Some medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) , are usually responsible. It’s estimated that around 1-5% of people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop this side effect than white people. Certain things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as: trauma – including surgery or infection the oral contraceptive pill pregnancy The mutated C1-inh gene is passed down through families. If you have hereditary angioedema, you have a 50% chance of passing it on to your children. Diagnosing angioedema It can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. There is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or blood tests if a specific cause is suspected. Allergic angioedema You’re likely to be asked if you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex. You may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such as urticaria (hives) or asthma . People with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions. Tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins. Your GP may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants – or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected. If allergic angioedema is suspected, you are likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests may include: a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction a blood test – a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen Read more about diagnosing allergies . Drug-induced angioedema If you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your GP will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. You should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional. Read more about Antihistamines Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell. A 2-week course of a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended – these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription. Antihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery. If you also have urticaria (hives) and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine to take before going to bed. These types cause drowsiness and should help you sleep. A minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid: driving drinking alcohol operating complex or heavy machinery Other side effects of the newer antihistamines include: headache dry mouth dry nose These side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids (steroids) work by blocking many of your immune system’s actions. In most cases, a 3 to 5 day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice. Side effects of prednisolone include: nausea abdominal (stomach) pain tiredness oral thrush – a fungal infection inside your mouth dizziness Danazol However, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause: weight gain depression disruption to the menstrual cycle – such as irregular periods or absent periods high blood pressure in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men – such as excessive body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone liver problems Due to these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated. Tranexamic acid Tranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women. Icatibant Icatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema. Icatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a second injection is often required. Common side effects of icatibant include: adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection – such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness itchiness in other areas of the skin dizziness C1-inhibitors Purified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It’s needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It’s used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein. Many patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use. Icatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema. ","Diagnosing angioedema . Who is affected Angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although some types are more common than others. Hereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. Angioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified. Allergic angioedema Normally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body. Substances known to trigger allergic angioedema include: certain types of food – particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs some types of medication – such as penicillin, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen insect bites and stings – particularly wasp and bee stings latex – a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms Idiopathic angioedema In cases of idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as: anxiety or stress minor infections hot or cold temperatures exercise bupropion – a medication that helps people to give up smoking vaccines selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) – a type of antidepressant COX-II inhibitors – a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as arthritis NSAIDs – a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or ibuprofen angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists – another medication used to treat high blood pressure statins – used to treat people with high cholesterol levels proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – used to treat stomach ulcers Hereditary angioedema Hereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour. ","Hereditary angioedema Hereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the C1-inh gene. A very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema. Idiopathic angioedema As angioedema can be associated with other medical problems – such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland – your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions. ","About angioedema Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid. For cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and oral steroids (steroid tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling. Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have. Read more about . While they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the “chemical balance” and trigger an episode of severe swelling. Allergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and corticosteroids to help relieve the swelling. . Medication for hereditary angioedema The medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1 of 2 categories: medication used to prevent angioedema ",
Bladder cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/bladder-cancer/,About bladder cancer ,"Types of bladder cancer Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has spread. If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases. Most people don’t die as a result of this type of bladder cancer. When the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it’s referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is less common, but has a higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal. If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it’s known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Read more about diagnosing bladder cancer Why does bladder cancer happen? Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder’s cells over many years. Tobacco smoke is a common cause and it’s estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. Contact with certain chemicals previously used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since been banned. Read more about the Blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer. The medical name for this is haematuria and it’s usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn’t always noticeable and it may come and go. a need to urinate on a more frequent basis sudden urges to urinate a burning sensation when passing urine pelvic pain bone pain unintentional weight loss swelling of the legs When to seek medical advice If you ever have blood in your urine – even if it comes and goes – you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated. In some cases, your GP may request a urine sample, so it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells. who should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer . At the hospital Some hospitals have specialist clinics for people with blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems. Cystoscopy If you’re referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered a cystoscopy . This procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate). A cystoscope is a thin tube with a camera and light at the end. Before having a cystoscopy, a local anaesthetic gel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so you don’t feel any pain. The gel also helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily. The procedure usually takes about 5 minutes. Imaging scans You may be offered a CT scan or an MRI scan if the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder. urinary tract infections Other side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting hair loss lack of appetite tiredness Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer Chemotherapy radiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area You can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief. Read more about end of life care Complications of bladder cancer For more information and advice about giving up smoking, have a browse through ","Diagnosing bladder cancer and preventing bladder cancer a urinary tract infection , such as cystitis a kidney infection kidney stones urethritis an enlarged prostate gland , in men Bladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. It’s often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn’t always known. What is cancer? Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. Increased risk Several factors have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer. Smoking Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. This is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals. If you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys into your urine. The bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. This can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may lead to bladder cancer. It’s estimated that just over a third of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. People who smoke may be up to four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers. Exposure to chemicals Exposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. Previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases. Chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include: aniline dyes 2-Naphthylamine 4-Aminobiphenyl xenylamine benzidine o-toluidine Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving: dyes textiles rubbers paints plastics leather tanning Some non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes. The link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above have been banned. However, these chemicals are still linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to 30 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop. Other risk factors Other factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include: radiotherapy to treat previous cancers near the bladder, such as bowel cancer If your doctor suspects bladder cancer, you’ll be referred to a hospital for further tests. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Read more about ",Emotional impact This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger feelings of depression . Signs that you may be depressed include: having continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness no longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoy ,"Complications of bladder cancer Preventing bladder cancer About bladder cancer Bladder cancer is where a growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles. The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless. If you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated. Read about the In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it’s usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact. This is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. In cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. When the bladder is removed, you’ll need another way of collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy. If it’s possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery is not suitable, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy. Read more about Who is affected? Bladder cancer is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed in people aged 75 and over. Bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the manufacturing industry. chemotherapy medications, such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin benign prostate enlargement type 2 diabetes having a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis long-term or repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs) long-term bladder stones having an early menopause (before the age of 42) an untreated infection called schistosomiasis , which is caused by a parasite that lives in fresh water – this is very rare in the UK How does bladder cancer spread? Bladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. In some cases, it may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. If the cancer penetrates this muscle, it can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. If bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it’s known as metastatic bladder cancer. Diagnosing bladder cancer During this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system. Transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT) If abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as TURBT. This is so any abnormal areas of tissue can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy). TURBT is carried out under general anaesthetic . Sometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within 6 weeks of the first biopsy . You should also be offered a dose of chemotherapy after the operation. This may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning if the removed cells are found to be cancerous. See for more information about the TURBT procedure Staging and grading Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is. Grading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread. The grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from G1 to G3. High-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers. The most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the TNM system, where: T stands for how far into the bladder the tumour has grown N stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes M stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs T stages The T staging system is as follows: TIS or CIS (carcinoma in situ) – a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining Ta – the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining T1 – the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder lining Bladder cancer up to the T1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. If the tumour grows larger than this, it’s usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as: T2 – the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle T3 – the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fat If the tumour grows larger than the T3 stage, it’s considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as: T4 – the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organs N stages The N staging system is as follows: N0 – there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes N1 – there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis N2 – there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis N3 – there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your groin M stages There are only two options in the M system: M0 – where the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body M1 – where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liver Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) Members of your MDT may include: a clinical oncologist – a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue a radiologist – a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniques Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer This risk is calculated using a series of factors, including: the number of tumours present in your bladder whether the tumours are larger than 3cm (1 inch) in diameter whether you’ve had bladder cancer before the grade of the cancer cells Low-risk Low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy when tissue samples are taken for testing (see diagnosing bladder cancer ). TURBT is carried out under general anaesthetic . The surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. The wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given a catheter to drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days. After surgery, you may be given a single dose of chemotherapy , directly into your bladder, using a catheter. The solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away. Most people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having TURBT and are able to resume normal physical activity within 2 weeks. You should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months and nine months to check your bladder, using a cystoscopy Intermediate-risk People with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least 6 doses of chemotherapy. The liquid is placed directly into your bladder, using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away. You should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months, 9 months, 18 months, then once every year. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. If your cancer returns within 5 years, you’ll be referred back to a specialist urology team. If you’re sexually active, it’s important to use a barrier method of contraception , such as a condom. This is because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation. You also shouldn’t try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects. High-risk People with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second TURBT operation, within 6 weeks of the initial investigation (see diagnosing bladder cancer ). A CT scan or an MRI scan may also be required. BCG vaccine an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) a frequent need to urinate pain when urinating blood in your urine (haematuria) You should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then once a year. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. If you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will need to create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). Your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created. Read about the complications of bladder cancer surgery for more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery. After having a cystectomy, you should be offered follow-up appointments including a CT scan at six and 12 months, and blood tests once a year. Men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for 5 years. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) – see above radiotherapy with a radiosensitiser Radiotherapy with a radiosensitiser Radiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). Sessions are usually given on a daily basis for 5 days a week over the course of 4 to 7 weeks. Each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes. A radiosensitiser should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. It has a much smaller effect on normal tissue. As well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. These include: diarrhoea inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) tightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful erectile dysfunction (in men) loss of pubic hair infertility tiredness difficulty passing urine Having radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you’ll be infertile for the rest of your life. However, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn’t usually a problem. After having radiotherapy for bladder cancer, you should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and every year after that. At these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. You may also be offered CT scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. A CT scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for 5 years. Surgery or radiotherapy? There are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy. The pros of having a radical cystectomy include: The cons of having a radical cystectomy include: it can take up to 3 months to fully recover a risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding a risk of complications from the use of general anaesthetic an alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag a high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%) as a result of nerve damage after surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller a small chance of a fatal complication, such as a heart attack , stroke or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) The pros of having radiotherapy include: there’s no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health your bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn’t removed there’s less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%) The cons of having radiotherapy include: you’ll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for 4 to 7 weeks short-term side effects are common, such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) a small chance of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating women may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortable Chemotherapy before radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation) to slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy) clinical trial . See clinical trials for bladder cancer for more information. a course of chemotherapy Palliative care antidepressant medication and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Read more about coping with cancer Urinary diversion If your bladder is removed, an alternative way of passing urine out of your body will be created during the operation. This is called urinary diversion. Your multidisciplinary team (MDT) can provide information on the most suitable options for you. Urostomy A urostomy is carried out during a radical cystectomy. A small section of the small bowel is removed and connected to your ureters (the 2 tubes that normally carry urine out of the kidneys). The surgeon then creates a small hole in the surface of your abdomen and the open end of the removed bowel is placed in this hole, creating an opening known as a stoma. A special waterproof bag is placed over the stoma to collect urine. A stoma nurse will teach you how to care for your stoma, and how and when to change the bag. Continent urinary diversion Continent urinary diversion is similar to a urostomy, but without an external bag. Instead, a section of your bowel is used to create a pouch inside your body that stores urine. The ureters are connected to the pouch and the pouch is connected to an opening in the abdominal wall. A valve in the opening (stoma) prevents urine leaking out. The pouch is emptied using a thin, flexible tube (catheter). Most people need to empty their pouch about 4 or 5 times a day. Bladder reconstruction In some cases it may be possible to create a new bladder, known as a neobladder. This involves removing a section of your bowel and reconstructing it into a balloon-like sac, before connecting it to your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) at one end and your ureters at the other end. However, bladder reconstruction isn’t suitable for everyone. You’ll be taught how to empty your neobladder by relaxing the muscles in your pelvis, while tightening the muscles in your abdomen at the same time. Your neobladder won’t contain the same types of nerve endings as a real bladder, so you won’t get the distinctive sensation that tells you to pass urine. Some people experience a feeling of fullness inside their abdomen, while others have reported they feel like they need to pass wind. Because of the loss of normal nerve function, most people with a neobladder experience some episodes of urinary incontinence , which usually occurs during the night, while they’re asleep. You may find it useful to empty your neobladder at set times during the day, including before you go to bed, to help prevent incontinence. Sexual problems Erectile dysfunction Contact your MDT if you lose the ability to obtain or maintain an erection after a radical cystectomy. It may be possible for you to be treated with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis. Narrowing of the vagina Both radiotherapy and cystectomy can cause a woman’s vagina to become shortened and narrowed, which can make penetrative sex painful or difficult. The second is to use vaginal dilators. These are plastic cone-shaped devices of various sizes that are designed to gently stretch your vagina and make it more supple. It’s usually recommended that you use dilators for a 5 to 10-minute period every day, starting with the dilator that fits in easiest first and gradually increasing the size, as your vagina stretches over the following weeks. You may find that the more often you have penetrative sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has information and a video about cancer and sexuality Preventing bladder cancer It’s not always possible to prevent bladder cancer, but some risk factors have been identified, which may increase your risk of developing the condition. Stopping smoking If you smoke, giving up is the best way to reduce your risk of developing bladder cancer and preventing it from recurring. If you decide to stop smoking, you could contact the Quit Your Way Scotland service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day).

Workplace safety Your risk of bladder cancer could be increased if your job involves exposure to certain chemicals. Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving: rubber dyes textiles plastic leather tanning diesel fumes Nowadays, there are rigorous safety protocols in place designed to minimise your risk of exposure, and chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer have been banned. If you’re uncertain about what these protocols involve, talk to your line manager or health and safety representative. If you’re concerned that your employer may be disregarding recommendations about workplace safety, you should contact the Health and Safety Executive for advice. Diet There’s some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in fat can help to prevent bladder cancer. Even though this evidence is limited, it’s a good idea to follow this type of healthy diet, as it can help to prevent other types of cancer, such as bowel cancer , as well as serious health conditions, including high blood pressure (hypertension) , stroke and heart disease . A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. Limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day (1 teaspoon) because too much can increase your blood pressure. You should try to avoid foods that contain saturated fat, as it can increase your cholesterol levels. Foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking) lard cream hard cheese cakes and biscuits foods that contain coconut or palm oil However, a balanced diet should include a small amount of unsaturated fat, because this will actually help to control your cholesterol levels. Foods high in unsaturated fat include: oily fish avocados nuts and seeds sunflower, rapeseed, olive and vegetable oils Read more about healthy eating ",

The bones Knowing what your bones do might help you understand what bone cancer is. Bones are like human scaffolding. They help keep you upright. The human skeleton is made up of more than 200 bones of different shapes and sizes. Bones do lots of important things: they work with joints and connective tissue so that you can move around they protect parts of the body from injury – for example, the ribs protect the heart and lungs they store calcium some bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cells Joints Joints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. There are different types of joint. Some work as levers, like the finger joint. Others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. There are different types of connective tissue that help bones move: ligaments are tough cords of tissue that attach bones to each other cartilage is a slippery material that covers the ends of bones to stop them rubbing together muscles are made of tough, stretchy tissue and give strength tendons are strong cords of tissue that attach muscles to bones We also have more information about: having tests for bone cancer , you should speak to your GP. At the hospital The hospital you’re referred to will depend on the results of the tests. You may go straight to a doctor specialising in bone cancer, or you might see doctors with more general experience first. The hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests: X-rays bone scans biopsies MRI and/or CT scans If you’re diagnosed with bone cancer and not already seeing a specialist bone doctor, you’ll be referred to one. Further tests If the tests show you have bone cancer, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general: blood tests tests to check your heart is healthy chest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy tests to check your kidneys are healthy – you may need to give a sample of pee (urine) to be tested having tests for bone cancer life after bone cancer the bones If you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general bone cancer section. having tests for bone cancer ","People often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there’s no evidence for this. Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer. ",,"Introduction This section about bone cancer is for teenagers and young adults. There are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. If you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you could talk to Macmillan . If you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general bone cancer section. Types of bone cancer There are different types of bone cancer. The 2 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcoma Osteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone. Ewing sarcoma Ewing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it’s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the 2 hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage. In this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer. life after bone cancer If you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general bone cancer section. Tests for bone cancer There are some tests you might have when you visit your GP or at the hospital. The tests will help the doctors see whether you have bone cancer. Visiting your GP If you think you might have some of the Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help. We have more information about: the bones life after bone cancer If you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general bone cancer section. The information on this page is about Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. If you have a different type of bone cancer and want to know more, you can talk to Macmillan . chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy . Most people have a combination of these. the type of bone cancer you have where the cancer is the stage of the cancer (this means whether it has spread outside the bone) how fast-growing the cancer is In this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Chemotherapy for bone cancer is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line. You’ll have chemotherapy over a few days and then you’ll have some time off to give your body a chance to recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. You’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy. The type of chemotherapy you have depends on whether the tumour is an Ewing sarcoma or an osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy for Ewing sarcoma For Ewing sarcoma, the drugs most often used first are vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. Giving these drugs together is called VIDE. You’ll usually have 6 cycles of VIDE. After your chemotherapy you may have surgery, or, if the tumour can’t be removed with an operation, you’ll have radiotherapy. Some people have both surgery and radiotherapy. The team looking after you will decide on the best combination for you. If you have surgery, you’ll have more chemotherapy afterwards to help stop the tumour coming back or spreading to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy for osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is usually treated with 3 chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cisplatin. Giving these drugs together is called MAP. You will usually have 6 cycles of chemotherapy in total. Each cycle takes about 5 weeks. After the first 2 cycles, you’ll have surgery to remove the cancer. If the cancer has spread, you may also need to have surgery on another part of your body. For example, if osteosarcoma spreads outside of the main tumour, it usually spreads to the lungs. If the cancer has spread to your lungs, you may need a second operation to remove the cancer in your lungs. If you have bone cancer that’s spread, your doctors will talk to you about what will happen next. Side effects The most common are a sore mouth, hair loss , tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection. The most common side effect of mifamurtide is having a high temperature or feeling cold and shivery for a few hours after it’s given. Surgery The surgery you have will depend on the type of bone cancer you have and where it is in the body. Your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, while trying to keep as much function in the limb as possible. Limb-sparing surgery Most people with bone cancer have an operation called limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon removes the cancer without having to remove the arm or leg it’s in. You’ll have all the tumour taken away from your limb, including any bone and muscle affected by the tumour. It’s usually possible to remove the affected part of the bone and replace it with a custom-made metal fitting (endoprosthesis) or with a bone from another part of the body (bone graft). If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, the whole joint can often be replaced with an artificial one. In some cases, the surgeon can remove the affected bone without replacing it with anything and without it affecting the way you move. Before the operation If you’ve had chemotherapy, you’ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover before you can have your operation. Doctors will make sure that you’re well enough to have the operation. If you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit before the operation. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You’ll probably see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to strengthen your muscles. You may like to see the replacement part or endoprosthesis (often just called a prosthesis) that will be put in during your operation. If you would like to see it, your surgeon or key worker can usually arrange this. After the operation You’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it supported and let it heal. You’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days. You won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein. This is called a drip. You’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 or 3 days. As time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. Once you’re home, you should start to feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems, it’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away, so they can deal with them quickly. After your operation, you will need to do lots of physiotherapy to help you make the best possible recovery. This can feel like hard work but is really important. Your physiotherapist will tell you what exercises to do, and help you to do them regularly. There’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after bone cancer . Amputation Sometimes the only way to get rid of the bone cancer affecting an arm or a leg is to remove the limb. This is called an amputation. It’s only done if there is no alternative. This is usually needed if the cancer has spread from the bone and has grown around nearby blood vessels. These need to be removed along with the cancer. Some people choose to have an amputation rather than limb-sparing surgery. You should be given a chance to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your team. Before the operation Your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and it might help to talk to your specialist nurse, key worker or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who’s had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It’s really important to get support at this tough time. After the operation You’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a tube, called a drain, coming from the wound. This stops fluid building up. A nurse will usually take it out after 3 or 4 days. You’ll also have a drip to give you fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again. You’ll probably feel a bit sore after your op, especially for the first 2 or 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. As time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. You may have pain that feels like it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as ‘phantom pain’. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time. A physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible. If you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days. Once you’re up and about, you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger. It’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and learn how to use it in physiotherapy. You should be able to go home about 2 weeks after your operation. There’s more information about the long-term effects of amputation in our section on living with and after bone cancer . Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Radiotherapy is mainly used to treat Ewing sarcoma. You may have radiotherapy after your chemotherapy, or before or after having surgery. Side effects Other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help. We also have more information about: This information is about life after having surgery for bone cancer . Life after limb-sparing surgery The long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about this is your surgeon. After limb-sparing surgery, the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them. Knee joint replacement If you’ve had a knee joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint. It’s usually OK to run a short distance, for example for a bus. But running or jogging regularly wears out the new joint, so it’s best to avoid this. If your knee joint wears out or loosens, you might need to have it replaced after a few years. Hip joint replacements After a hip joint replacement, you should be able to do most of your usual activities, but you’ll probably be advised to avoid running and high-impact sports. Shoulder replacement If you’ve had a shoulder replacement, you’ll be able to move your arm below shoulder height the same as before, but you might not be able to lift your arm above your shoulder. Bone graft If you’ve had an implant put into your limb while you’re still growing, you’ll need to have it lengthened as your leg or arm grows. Some types of implant can be lengthened without an operation, but with others you’ll need surgery. Your specialist or key worker can tell you what kind of implant you have. Life after amputation After amputation, you usually have an artificial limb fitted. This is called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports. Different types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics. How will I feel? Things may be tough as you get used to living with the changes in your body, but help is available. You might have lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or sad at times. You might feel like you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it’s important to get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to: your specialist nurse or key worker family or friends a counsellor, which can be arranged by your nurses other young people in a similar situation Other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful. Try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends who you can talk to if things get you down. You might find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like your specialist nurse, key worker or counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind.

The genes you you inherit from your parents are a factor in developing the condition. The way ADHD is inherited is complex and isn’t thought to be related to a single gene. Brain function and structure Research has identified some possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD. Some studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be a different size in people with ADHD. Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have a chemical imbalance in the brain. Or that some chemicals may not work properly.

Benign prostate enlargement,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/kidneys-bladder-and-prostate/benign-prostate-enlargement/,About benign prostate enlargement ,"Read more about the Many people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer . This isn’t the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an enlarged prostate. You may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a blood test that measures PSA. Read more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement You’ll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake, and exercising regularly Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Read more about This can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can: make it difficult for you to start urinating weaken the flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’ cause you to strain to pass urine cause you to need to urinate frequently cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in urinary incontinence if you can’t find a toilet quickly enough cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully cause blood in the urine (haematuria) In the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as bladder stones, bladder infections and kidney damage. When to seek medical advice Any blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions. , the next stage is to calculate your International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) The checklist includes the following questions. Over the past month, how often: have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating? have you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after finishing urinating? have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating? have you found it difficult to postpone urination? have you had a weak stream of urine? have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night? have you had to get up during the night to urinate? Ruling out other conditions prostate cancer Urine tests kidney infection or bladder infection. Rectal examination You may need a rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy. Your GP will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. As the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they’ll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. The procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn’t usually painful. Prostate cancer doesn’t always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. You will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test A blood test can be used to measure the amount of the PSA protein that’s produced by the prostate. kidney stone or bladder stone. It can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract. During a CT urogram, you’ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible on X-rays . After 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of X-rays will be taken. In some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final X-ray is taken. Voiding charts A voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. You’ll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate – for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it’s difficult to start urinating. Uroflowmetry Uroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate. You’ll be given a local anaesthetic and a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder. Water will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. A computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working. Lifestyle changes If your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to: avoid drinking any liquids for 1 to 2 hours before going to bed – this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia) experiment with the time you take prescribed medication – for example, taking it at 7pm may help prevent nocturia stop drinking alcohol exercise regularly – research shows moderate exercise, such as walking Bladder training Bladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold. You’ll be given a target, such as waiting at least 2 hours between each time you urinate. It’s a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed – you’ll need a plastic jug to measure this. Your doctor should give you a chart to take home. You’ll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate. Over time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you’re able to go for longer without urinating. Bladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision. Medication Finasteride or dutasteride Finasteride and dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Find out about the However, you’ll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year. Use condoms if you’re sexually active – both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. If you get a woman pregnant, there’s a risk the baby could develop birth defects. Other possible side effects can also include impotence and little or no sperm when you ejaculate. In many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. See your GP if the side effects are troubling you. Alpha blockers Various procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis. A wire loop heated by an electric current is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate. TURP is carried out using either a general anaesthetic , where you’re asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you’re awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed. The procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. Most people are well enough to leave hospital 2 to 3 days after the operation. After surgery, you’ll be unable to urinate normally at first because of your swollen urethra. A thin tube called a catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. This will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery. A common complication of TURP is you’ll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. This is known as retrograde ejaculation. The procedure can be carried out under local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia. It involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra. The implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn’t blocked. One of the big advantages of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with TURP and TUIP is a reduced risk to your sexual function – there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems. There’s also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won’t need to stay in hospital as long. However, prostatic urethral lift implants are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases. And as it’s a new procedure, the long-term outcomes are unknown and availability may be limited. Read more about the use of prostatic urethral lift implants Transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP) Transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP) is similar to a TURP, but parts of the prostate are destroyed (vaporised) rather than cut away. Greenlight laser surgery (PVP) A laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. This particular form of TUVP is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP), or Greenlight laser surgery. A thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. A laser fibre is then passed through the cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow. cloudy, bloody or bad – smelling urine pain in your lower abdomen (tummy) nausea vomiting shaking and chills a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above UTIs can be treated with antibiotics . A single UTI isn’t usually serious, but repeated UTIs can damage your kidneys and bladder. If you have a history of repeated UTIs, you may need to have surgery. Acute urinary retention the sudden inability to pass urine severe lower abdominal pain swelling of the bladder that you can feel with your hands AUR can be treated using a thin tube (catheter) to drain the urine out of your bladder. In very serious cases, surgery may be required to empty the bladder. ","Diagnosing benign prostate enlargement The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it’s linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older. Read more about the How is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed? The exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition’s development. Hormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body. One theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate. Another theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It’s been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth. Risk factors Research has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate with high blood pressure and diabetes . However, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions. Diagnosing benign prostate enlargement To find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you’ll need to have a few tests. Some tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems). Bladder neck incision (TUIP) Bladder neck incision involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. It is also known as transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). Like TURP, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. The resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder. This type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. As with TURP, TUIP is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic. After surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. Like TURP, you’ll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you’re able to urinate normally. There’s less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with TUIP compared with TURP, although it can sometimes still occur. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is similar to a TURP. Excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. However, it uses a laser, rather than a wire loop. There are some advantages to using this technique rather than a TURP, but also some disadvantages. If you have been offered a HoLEP, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared with TURP. Insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants ","Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) A TRUS is a type of ultrasound scan specifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area. An ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate. Computer tomographic (CT) urogram A CT urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra). ","Complications of benign prostate enlargement About benign prostate enlargement Benign prostate enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a condition that affects older men and anyone with a prostate. It’s particularly common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age and isn’t usually a serious threat to health. Prostate gland The prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It’s involved in the production of semen. The prostate produces a thick, white fluid that’s made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen. If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can affect how you pass urine and may cause: difficulty starting urination a frequent need to urinate difficulty fully emptying the bladder Complications of benign prostate enlargement Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare. Read more about the complications of benign prostate enlargement How common is benign prostate enlargement? Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age. lifestyle changes medication surgery Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are 2 alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild. They include: dizziness headaches weakness little or no sperm when you ejaculate You should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you’re not planning to drive, as there’s a risk they could cause low blood pressure (hypotension) and fainting. Generally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it’s passed. Surgery doesn’t have urinary retention doesn’t have an increased risk of bleeding has a prostate smaller than 100ml In these ‘low-risk’ groups, Greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as TURP, but also has several benefits. These include: a shorter hospital stay – the procedure is often carried out as a day case the catheter can be removed sooner recovery is quicker there’s a lower risk of complications The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website has more information about . Open prostatectomy An open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than TURP if you have severe benign prostate enlargement. However, it’s now rarely used, even for larger prostates, because other techniques have been developed, such as HoLEP. During an open prostatectomy, an incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed. The procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence . There’s also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after TURP. Complications of benign prostate enlargement Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as a urinary tract infection or acute urinary retention. Urinary tract infections If you’re unable to empty your bladder properly, there’s a risk that bacteria in your urinary system won’t get flushed out and will spread through the urine to cause a urinary tract infection (UTI) .

While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis. jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes itchy skin abdominal (tummy) pain Unblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver. The bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent. The stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again. A stent can be inserted using either: a variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct a variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal wall Occasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. If this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced. Radiotherapy external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumour Radiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. However, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. Side effects of radiotherapy include: nausea (feeling sick) vomiting fatigue (severe tiredness) Read more about radiotherapy Chemotherapy Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. Side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting fatigue hair loss ","Diagnosing bile duct cancer Types of bile duct cancer There are 2 main types of bile duct cancer, depending on where the cancer begins: cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition. Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system. Increased risk A number of factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified. Age Your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. Most people with the condition are over 65 years old. Primary sclerosing cholangitis It usually occurs in people aged 30 to 50. Up to 10% of people with ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have PSC. Around 10 to 20% of people with PSC will develop bile duct cancer. Your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have PSC and you smoke. Bile duct abnormalities Some people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct. These cysts are usually congenital, which means they are present from birth. The most common types are choledochal cysts and Caroli’s disease, but both conditions are very rare. Up to 20% of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct. Biliary stones Biliary stones are similar to gallstones , except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder. Biliary stones are rare in western Europe, but are relatively common in parts of Asia, such as Japan and Taiwan. It’s estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer. Parasitic infection Liver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. You can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs. Liver fluke infections are usually only a problem in Asia (especially Thailand) and Africa, where liver flukes are more widespread. Exposure to toxins Exposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. For example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. Thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood. Other toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include: asbestos – a fire-resistant material that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) – a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been banned Other factors The following factors are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed: hepatitis B and hepatitis C cirrhosis (a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol HIV diabetes obesity smoking Diagnosing bile duct cancer ","Cancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including: blood tests ultrasound scans computerised tomography (CT) scans magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans For some of these tests, you may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts. You may also need a biopsy . This involves removing a small sample of tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone. Read more about diagnosing bile duct cancer How is bile duct cancer treated? Cancer of the bile duct can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven’t spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct may be removed. Blood tests In bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain chemicals that can be detected using blood tests . These are known as tumour markers. However, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions. A positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean you don’t. Scans A number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. These scans include: ultrasound scan – high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body computer tomography (CT) scan – a series of X-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liver Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on an X-ray scanner. A special dye is injected and the X-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. The endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct that could be the result of bile duct cancer. A short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. Spyglass An advanced form of ERCP is a special test called a spyglass. This involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. It also enables a biopsy to be taken. While this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. Therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed X-ray image of your bile duct. The side of your abdomen (tummy) is numbed using local anaesthetic , and a special dye that shows up on X-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct. As with ECRP, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. PTC and ECRP are both useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer. Biopsy If scans indicate that you may have bile duct cancer, a biopsy During a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. A biopsy is usually performed while ERCP or PTC is being carried out. As well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. This is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system. Staging A widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. The stages are: stage 1A – the cancer is contained inside the bile duct stage 1B – the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes stage 2 – the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes and major blood vessels that supply the liver stage 4 – the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungs Read more about staging bile duct cancer on the Cancer Research UK website Cancer support If you are diagnosed with cancer, the Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF) is currently the only dedicated UK charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer. a cancer nurse – who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team a gastroenterologist – a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary disease ","Preventing bile duct cancer About bile duct cancer Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer. The bile duct system, or ‘biliary’ system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods. chemotherapy Who is affected? Most cases of bile duct cancer occur in people over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally. Can bile duct cancer be prevented? There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it. The most effective ways of achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as cirrhosis is a risk factor, and trying to ensure that you don’t become infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Read more about preventing bile duct cancer a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue stage the cancer has reached . In cases of stage 1 and stage 2 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder. In cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. A cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes. . Surgery If your MDT thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. Depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove: the part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells your gallbladder nearby lymph nodes a large part of your liver After surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still flow into the intestine. Similarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. The liver can also regenerate itself after surgery. You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home. Success rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery. Unblocking the bile duct Read more about chemotherapy For example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies Another promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies are medications that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce. Read more about clinical trials and clinical trials for bile duct cancer Preventing bile duct cancer There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, although it is possible to reduce your chances of developing the condition. The 3 most effective steps to reduce your chances of developing bile duct cancer are: giving up smoking (if you smoke) drinking alcohol in moderation minimising your exposure to the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses Stopping smoking Not smoking is the most effective way of preventing bile duct cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as stroke , heart attack and lung cancer . It is particularly important to stop smoking if you have the liver condition known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). If you have PSC, smoking will significantly increase your chances of developing bile duct cancer. Your GP can advise on how to give up smoking. They can also recommend and prescribe suitable medication. You can get more information and advice from the Quit Your Way Scotland advice and support service. Read more about stopping smoking Alcohol If you are a heavy drinker, reducing your alcohol intake will help prevent liver damage (cirrhosis) . This may, in turn, reduce your risk of developing bile duct cancer. Reducing your alcohol consumption is particularly important if you have a pre-existing liver condition, such as PSC or hepatitis B or C. Read low-risk drinking guidelines Visit your GP if you are finding it difficult to moderate your alcohol consumption. Counselling and medication are available to help reduce the amount you drink. Read more about alcohol Hepatitis C If you regularly inject drugs, the best way to avoid getting hepatitis C is to never share any of your drug-injecting equipment with others. You should also avoid sharing any object that could be contaminated with blood, such as razors and toothbrushes. There is less risk of getting hepatitis C by having sex with someone who is infected. However, as a precaution it is best to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, with a new partner. Read more about preventing hepatitis C Hepatitis B A vaccine is available that provides immunisation against hepatitis B . Vaccination would usually only be recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as: people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs people who change their sexual partner frequently people travelling to or from a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread healthcare workers who may have come into contact with the virus Pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B. If they are infected, their baby can be vaccinated shortly after birth to prevent them also becoming infected. Read more detailed information about hepatitis B vaccination The liver fluke The liver fluke is a major cause of bile duct cancer in Asia. It is a parasite which, after infection, damages the tissue of the bile duct and in some cases triggers the onset of bile duct cancer. The liver fluke is widespread in Thailand. Other countries where the liver fluke can be found include: Cambodia Laos Vietnam Infection occurs after eating raw or undercooked fish contaminated by fluke eggs. Always ensure any fish you eat is cooked thoroughly when travelling in these countries. ",
Bipolar disorder,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder/,Introduction ,"depend on which mood you’re experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a “normal” mood very often. Depression You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder . During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide .

Mania During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can’t afford and wouldn’t normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. psychosis , where you see or hear things that aren’t there or become convinced of things that aren’t true. Living with bipolar disorder The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. However, there are several options for learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). Episodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months. Depression feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time lacking energy difficulty concentrating and remembering things loss of interest in everyday activities feelings of emptiness or worthlessness feelings of guilt and despair feeling pessimistic about everything self-doubt being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking lack of appetite difficulty sleeping waking up early suicidal thoughts Mania The manic phase of bipolar disorder may include: feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed talking very quickly feeling full of energy feeling self-important feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans being easily distracted being easily irritated or agitated being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking not feeling like sleeping not eating doing things that often have disastrous consequences – such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful Patterns of depression and mania If you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa. Between episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a “normal” mood. The patterns aren’t always the same and some people may experience: rapid cycling – where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a “normal” period in between If your mood swings last a long time but aren’t severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder). Living with bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes. A person with the condition may be unaware they’re in the manic phase. After the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people are being negative or unhelpful. Some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others. The extreme nature of the condition means staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There’s also an increased risk of suicide . During episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren’t there (hallucinations). psychosis or a psychotic episode. Read more about living with bipolar disorder . For example, there’s evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low. Genetics It’s also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. The family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves. However, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers. Triggers the breakdown of a relationship physical, sexual or emotional abuse the death of a close family member or loved one These types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person’s life. Bipolar disorder may also be triggered by: physical illness sleep disturbances overwhelming problems in everyday life – such as problems with money, work or relationships The psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder. If someone else in your family has the condition, the psychiatrist may want to talk to them. However, they’ll ask for your agreement before doing so.

Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. Who’s affected? Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition. These are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors. Chemical imbalance in the brain Bipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain. The chemicals responsible for controlling the brain’s functions are called neurotransmitters and include noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine. There’s some evidence that if there’s an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some ","If your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they’ll usually refer you to a psychiatrist (a medically qualified mental health specialist).

Care Information Scotland: Money Living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder People living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder can have a tough time. During episodes of illness, the personalities of people with bipolar disorder may change, and they may become abusive or even violent. Sometimes social workers and the police may become involved. Relationships and family life are likely to feel the strain. If you’re the Named Person (as defined by the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015) of a person with bipolar disorder, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the person’s interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority asks an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with bipolar disorder should be detained in hospital (also known as “sectioning”). You may feel at a loss if you’re caring for someone with bipolar disorder. Finding a support group and talking to other people in a similar situation might help. If you’re having relationship or marriage difficulties, you can contact specialist relationship counsellors, who can talk things through with you and your partner. Want to know more? Care Information Scotland: Support for carers Relate: Relationship advice Dealing with suicidal feelings ","Living with bipolar disorder Introduction Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another. People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of: depression – feeling very low and lethargic mania – feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Find out more about living with bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder and pregnancy Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. If a person isn’t treated, episodes of bipolar-related mania can last for between three and six months. Episodes of depression tend to last longer, for between six and 12 months. medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep Read more about living with bipolar disorder Medication Several medications are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly referred to as mood stabilisers and include: lithium carbonate anticonvulsant medicines antipsychotic medicines If you’re already taking medication for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, your GP will check you’re taking the correct dose. If you aren’t, they’ll change it. Episodes of depression are treated slightly differently in bipolar disorder, as the use of antidepressants alone may lead to a hypomanic relapse. Most guidelines suggest depression in bipolar disorder can be treated with just a mood stabiliser. However, antidepressants are commonly used alongside a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic. Read more about antidepressants If your GP or psychiatrist recommends you stop taking medication for bipolar disorder, the dose should be gradually reduced over at least four weeks, and up to three months if you are taking an antipsychotic or lithium. If you have to stop taking lithium for any reason, see your GP about taking an antipsychotic or valproate instead. Lithium carbonate In the UK, lithium carbonate (often referred to as just lithium) is the medication most commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. If you’re prescribed lithium, stick to the prescribed dose and don’t stop taking it suddenly (unless told to by your doctor). For lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. If it’s incorrect, you may get side effects such as diarrhoea and vomiting. However, tell your doctor immediately if you have side effects while taking lithium. You’ll need regular blood tests at least every three months while taking lithium. This is to make sure your lithium levels aren’t too high or too low. Your kidney and thyroid function will also need to be checked every two to three months if the dose of lithium is being adjusted, and every 12 months in all other cases. While you’re taking lithium, avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen , unless they’re prescribed by your GP. In the UK, lithium and the antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole are currently the only medications licensed for use in adolescents with bipolar disorder who are aged 13 or over. However, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health states that unlicensed medicines may be prescribed for children if there are no suitable alternatives and their use can be justified by expert agreement. Anticonvulsant medicines Anticonvulsant medicines include: valproate carbamazepine lamotrigine These medicines are sometimes used to treat episodes of mania. They’re also long-term mood stabilisers. Anticonvulsant medicines are often used to treat epilepsy A single anticonvulsant medicine may be used, or they may be used in combination with lithium when the condition doesn’t respond to lithium on its own. Valproate Valproate isn’t usually prescribed for women of childbearing age because there’s a risk of physical defects to babies such as spina bifida, heart abnormalities and cleft lip. There may also be an increased risk of developmental problems such as lower intellectual abilities, poor speaking and understanding, memory problems, autistic spectrum disorders and delayed walking and talking. Learn more about the risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy If you’re prescribed valproate, you’ll need to visit your GP to have a blood count when you begin the medication, and then again six months later. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is usually only prescribed on the advice of an expert in bipolar disorder. To begin with, the dose will be low and then gradually increased. Your progress will be carefully monitored if you’re taking other medication, including the contraceptive pill. Blood tests to check your liver and kidney function will be carried out when you start taking carbamazepine, and again after six months. You’ll also need to have a blood count at the start and after six months, and you may also have your weight and height monitored. Lamotrigine If you’re prescribed lamotrigine, you’ll usually be started on a low dose, which will be increased gradually. See your GP immediately if you’re taking lamotrigine and develop a rash. You’ll need to have an annual health check, but other tests aren’t usually needed. Women who are taking the contraceptive pill should talk to their GP about taking a different method of contraception. Antipsychotic medicines Antipsychotic medicines are sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania or hypomania. Antipsychotic medicines include: aripiprazole olanzapine quetiapine risperidone They may also be used as a long-term mood stabiliser. Quetiapine may also be used for long-term bipolar depression. Rapid cycling You may be prescribed a combination of lithium and valproate if you experience rapid cycling (where you quickly change from highs to lows without a “normal” period in between). If this doesn’t help, you may be offered lithium on its own or a combination of lithium, valproate and lamotrigine. However, you won’t usually be prescribed an antidepressant unless an expert in bipolar disorder has recommended it. Learning to recognise triggers If you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression. A community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history. This won’t prevent the episode occurring, but it will allow you to get help in time. psychoeducation – to find out more about bipolar disorder cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) family therapy – a type of psychotherapy that focuses on family relationships (such as marriage) and encourages everyone within the family or relationship to work together to improve mental health Pregnancy The management of bipolar disorder in women who are pregnant , or those who are trying to conceive, is complex and challenging. One of the main problems is the risks of taking medication during pregnancy aren’t always that well understood. NICE also recommends that specialist mental health services work closely with maternity services. The plan should be drawn up with the patient, her partner, her obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor. The following medication isn’t routinely prescribed for pregnant women with bipolar disorder: valproate – there’s a risk to the foetus and the subsequent development of the child carbamazepine – it has limited effectiveness and there’s risk of harm to the foetus lithium – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiac problems lamotrigine – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus paroxetine – there’s a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiovascular malformations benzodiazepines – if used long term, there are risks during the pregnancy and immediately after the birth, such as cleft palate and floppy baby syndrome If you become pregnant while taking medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, it’s important that you don’t stop taking it until you’ve discussed it with your doctor. If medication is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby is born, it may also affect a mother’s decision to breastfeed her child. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances. Living with bipolar disorder Although it’s usually a long-term condition, effective , combined with self-help techniques, can limit the condition’s impact on your everyday life. Staying active and eating well You should have a check-up at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes . This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure and having any appropriate blood tests. Read more information about losing weight and improving fitness Self-care and self-management Self-care Self-care is an essential part of daily life. It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from the people involved in your care. It includes: staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health preventing illness or accidents caring more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions People with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being helped with self-care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Self-management programmes Self-management programmes aim to help people with bipolar disorder take an active part in their own recovery so they’re not controlled by their condition. One course run by Bipolar UK aims to teach people with bipolar disorder how to manage their illness. The programme includes information about: triggers and warning signs coping strategies and self-medication support networks and action plans maintaining a healthy lifestyle drawing up an advance decision complementary therapies action plans There are other courses, such as those run by Self Management UK , for mild to moderate mental health conditions. Courses such as these help people who may feel distressed and uncertain about their bipolar disorder improve their own lives. Talking about it Some people with bipolar disorder find it easy to talk to family and friends about their condition and its effects. Other people find it easier to turn to charities and support groups. Many organisations run self-help groups that can put you in touch with other people with the condition. This enables people to share helpful ideas and helps them realise they’re not alone in feeling the way they do. These organisations also provide online support in forums and blogs. Some useful charities, support groups and associations include: Bipolar UK Carers UK Mind Rethink Samaritans SANE Talking therapies are useful for managing bipolar disorder, particularly during periods of stability. Services that can help These services may include: Avoiding drugs and alcohol Others may have separate but related problems of alcohol and drug abuse, which may need to be treated separately. Some research has shown the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is 15 to 20 times greater than the general population. Studies have also shown that as many as 25-50% of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once. The risk of suicide seems to be higher earlier in the illness, so early recognition and help may prevent it. ",

Sepsis is a serious complication of an infection. feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs joint pain chest pain breathlessness Temperature over 38C (babies under 3 months) over 39C (babies aged 3 to 6 months) below 36C – check 3 times in a 10-minute period a high temperature in a child who can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything Breathing difficulty breathing – this looks like hard work grunting with every breath struggling to speak more than a few words at once (for older children who normally talk) breathing that obviously “pauses” Eating and drinking no interest in feeding (child under 1 month) not drinking for more than 8 hours (when awake) black, green or bloody vomit Body a soft spot on a baby’s head that bulges “sunken” eyes a baby that’s floppy a child that can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything weak, whining or continuous crying in a younger child confusion in an older child irritableness unresponsive stiffness in the neck, especially when trying to look up or down not had a wee or wet nappy for 12 hours Go to A&E or call 999 if your child: is very lethargic or difficult to wake feels abnormally cold to touch is breathing very fast has a rash that does not fade when you press it has a fit or convulsion a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop. These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation diarrhoea nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness Phone 999 or go to A&E if: you’ve recently had an infection or injury and you have possible signs of sepsis you think you or someone in your care has severe sepsis or septic shock Don’t be afraid to ask the healthcare professional ‘is this sepsis?’. ","The immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. This is called a localised infection. To do this, the body produces white blood cells. White blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. This triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. This helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading. However, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe. Widespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues. Sources of infection Sepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the: lungs urinary tract tummy (abdomen) pelvis However, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can’t be identified. Infections linked to sepsis appendicitis – infection in the appendix cellulitis – a skin infection that can be caused by an intravenous catheter that’s been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication cholangitis – an infection of the bile duct cholecystitis – an infection of the gallbladder encephalitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system endocarditis – a heart infection flu – only in some cases meningitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system peritonitis – an infection of the thin layer of tissue that lines the abdomen pneumonia – a lung infection post-surgery infections osteomyelitis – a bone infection urinary tract infection – an infection of the bladder, urethra or kidneys Tests to diagnose sepsis Sepsis is often diagnosed by testing your: temperature heart rate breathing rate blood Other tests can help determine the type of infection, where it’s located and which parts of the body have been affected. These include: urine or stool samples a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies – like an X-ray , ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan Who’s at risk of sepsis? Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who: are very young are very old are pregnant have had a urinary catheter fitted have a long term health condition like diabetes have recently had surgery are genetically prone to infections are already in hospital with a serious illness have to stay in hospital for a long time have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident have a medical condition that weakens the immune system – like HIV or leukaemia ","Intravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. You may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition. Types of antibiotics If sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. This is because there won’t be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified. Broad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. They usually cure most common infections. Once a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used. Viral infections ","About sepsis Phone 999 immediately or go to A&E if: chemotherapy or long-term steroids are on mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe Recovering from sepsis Some people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on: the severity of the sepsis the person’s overall health how much time was spent in hospital Long term effects of sepsis Some people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome. area affected cause of the infection organs affected extent of any damage the sepsis is severe you develop septic shock – when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level Sepsis is treatable if it’s identified and treated quickly. In most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems. Antibiotics antibiotics . These will be given directly into a vein (intravenously). With a viral infection, you’ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. However, antiviral medication may be given in some cases. Intravenous fluids If you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure. If you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours. It’s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. This helps them spot signs of kidney failure. If you’re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given a catheter . This is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output. Oxygen Your body’s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis. If you’re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you’ll usually be given oxygen. This is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils. If a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated. For example, any pus may need to be drained away. In more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage. Increasing blood pressure Medications called vasopressors are used if you have low blood pressure caused by sepsis. Vasopressors are normally given intravenously while you’re in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure. corticosteroids insulin medication a blood transfusion mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe dialysis – where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys ",
Bone cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/bone-cancer/,About bone cancer ,"Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint a noticeable lump over a bone a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP. While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation. Read more about the Types of bone cancer Some of the main types of bone cancer are: osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20 Ewing sarcoma – which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20 chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40 Young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop. Bone pain Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting. Any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. The pain can sometimes be wrongly mistaken for arthritis in adults and growing pains in children and teenagers. Some people also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint. In some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily after a minor injury or fall . a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above unexplained weight loss sweating, particularly at night When to seek medical advice Read more about diagnosing bone cancer They will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience – whether it’s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse. After being examined, you may be referred for an X-ray of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist for a further assessment. X-rays An X-ray is a procedure where radiation is used to produce images of the inside of the body. It’s a particularly effective way of looking at bones. Chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel. Radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine. again and think the cancer may have come back. ","Diagnosing bone cancer In most cases, it’s not known why a person develops bone cancer. You’re more at risk of developing it if you: have had previous exposure to radiation during radiotherapy have a condition known as Paget’s disease of the bone – however, only a very small number of people with Paget’s disease will actually develop bone cancer have a rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome – people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells Read more about the How bone cancer is treated Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. The exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including: previous radiotherapy Common side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea mouth ulcers tiredness increased risk of catching infections temporary hair loss infertility ","Being told you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or if you’re a parent of a child who has just been told they have bone cancer. These types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger depression ","About bone cancer Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones. This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body. These pages only refer to primary bone cancer. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about secondary bone cancer . Most people have a combination of: surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, but amputation is sometimes necessary chemotherapy radiotherapy – where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells In some cases of osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may also be recommended. Read more about Outlook The outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade). Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn’t spread. other bone conditions, such as Paget’s disease of the bone rare genetic conditions, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome a history of certain other conditions, including retinoblastoma and umbilical hernia Previous exposure to high doses of radiation during radiotherapy may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small. Bone conditions Some non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small. In particular, a condition called Paget’s disease of the bone can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50 to 60 years of age. Rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier’s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer. Genetic conditions A rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer. People with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body. Other conditions People who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions. Research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma, although the risk is still very small. Diagnosing bone cancer Biopsy The most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a biopsy . A biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below). A biopsy can be carried out in two ways: A core needle biopsy is performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic ). A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue. An open biopsy is performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue. You may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive. Further tests If the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it’s likely you’ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues. An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones. CT scan A computerised tomography (CT) scan involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3D) image of your body. CT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose. Bone scans A bone scan can give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins. Abnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as “hot spots” on the scan. Bone marrow biopsy If you have a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma , you may have a test called a bone marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones). During the test, a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic. Staging and grading Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. A widely used staging system for bone cancer in the UK uses 3 main stages: stage 1 – the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone stage 2 – the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade stage 3  – the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs You may also find it useful to contact the Bone Cancer Research Trust , which is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you’re a teenager you may want to contact the Teenage Cancer Trust , which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer. Read more about surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, although amputation is occasionally necessary chemotherapy radiotherapy – where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells In some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well. Surgery Nowadays, it’s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation). Limb-sparing surgery Limb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed. The most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue). The removed section of bone may then be replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft). If the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about knee joint replacement and hip joint replacement. Amputation Amputation may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if: the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle Your care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation. After an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that’s removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life. Recovering from surgery After limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you’ll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation. Rehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and occupational therapy , where you’re taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities. living with an amputation . Chemotherapy There are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used: before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier Ewing sarcoma after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning Side effects Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy Radiotherapy Side effects The radiation you’re exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to side effects such as: reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn) joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated feeling sick hair loss in the body part being treated tiredness These side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy Mifamurtide Mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells that kill cancerous cells. It’s normally recommended for young people with high-grade osteosarcomas and is given after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning. Side effects Mifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea or constipation headache dizziness loss of appetite tiredness and weakness It’s unclear whether it’s safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it’s important to use an effective method of contraception if you’re a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you think you’re pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide. Follow-up Contact your specialist or GP if you develop ",

Read further information: Beating Bowel Cancer: Bowel Cancer UK: Cancer Research UK: Check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope – a long, narrow flexible tube that contains a small camera – that is inserted into your rectum. The frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer. Genetic conditions There are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) – a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome – an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk Although the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50. As people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25. Families affected can find support and advice from FAP registries such as The Polyposis Registry provided by St Mark’s Hospital, London. Removing the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with HNPCC because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high. Read further information: Bowel Cancer UK: Risk factors Bowel Cancer UK: Diet Diagnosing bowel cancer They will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (DRE). This is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. The tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral . Flexible sigmoidoscopy A flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope. A sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. It is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel. The camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take biopsies , where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis. It is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema – a simple procedure to flush your bowels – at home beforehand. This should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment. A sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination. More detailed tests Most people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon. The two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (CT) colonography. Colonoscopy A colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope, which is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer. Your bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed, so you will be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and take a laxative (medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination. You will be given a sedative to help you relax during the test, after which the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. This is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable. The camera relays images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. As with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test. A colonoscopy usually takes about an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative. After the procedure, you will probably feel drowsy for a while, so you will need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. It is best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. You will be advised not to drive for 24 hours. In a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel, and it is then necessary to have CT colonography. Find out more about what a colonoscopy involves CT colonography CT colonography, also known as a ‘virtual colonoscopy’, involves using a computerised tomography (CT) scanner to produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum. During the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. CT scans are then taken from a number of different angles. As with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out. This test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy because of other medical reasons. A CT colonography is a less invasive test than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied.

They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both. , taking part in bowel cancer screening when it is offered can help reduce your chances of dying from the condition.

Bowel screening involves taking a simple test at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer. Read more about screening for bowel cancer Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. Most cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. These clumps are known as polyps . However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer. Age Your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost 9 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60. Family history Having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50. If you are particularly concerned that your family’s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition. Diet A large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer. For this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day.

As well as making lifestyle changes and keeping an eye out for possible ","Living with bowel cancer Preventing bowel cancer About bowel cancer Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer. Cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer. Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK. surgery – the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells As with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far it has advanced by the time it is diagnosed. Read more about how bowel cancer is treated and living with bowel cancer A number of different staging systems are used by doctors. stage 1 – the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum stage 2 – the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver There are 3 grades of bowel cancer: grade 1 – a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 2 – a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 3 – a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel If you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor. If colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision. If the cancer spreads into muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed: an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy – where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon During surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. It is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed. Both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications. However, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. It is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations. Laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used. Surgery for rectal cancer There are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread. Some of the main techniques used are described below: Local resection If you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection). The surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum. Total mesenteric excision In many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed. This area will include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue from around the bowel (the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME). Removing the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage. Depending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out. Low anterior resection Low anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum. The surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed. They will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum. You will probably require a temporary stoma to give the joined section of bowel time to heal. Abdominoperineal resection Abdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum. In this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area. This involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation. Bowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible. Stoma surgery Where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal. The stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin – this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool. When the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an ileostomy , and when it is made from the large bowel (colon) it is called a colostomy . A specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma prior to surgery. The nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency. In the first few days after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable. Once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed during further surgery. In some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent. Before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent. There are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups online for further information. Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery Learn more about coping with a stoma after bowel cancer Side effects of surgery Bowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems. The operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. One risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation. Another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves. After rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although this usually settles down within a few months of the operation. Radiotherapy Internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later. Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days. Short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: feeling sick fatigue diarrhoea burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis – this looks and feels like sunburn a frequent need to urinate a burning sensation when passing urine Long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: a more frequent need to pass urine or stools blood in your urine and stools infertility erectile dysfunction Chemotherapy There are 3 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer: before surgery – used in combination with radiotherapy to shrink the tumour after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring A single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days. Side effects of chemotherapy can include: fatigue feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea mouth ulcers hair loss a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. Inform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell. Medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men’s sperm and women’s eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby’s health. Find out more about chemotherapy Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). As EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy. Cetuximab is only available on the NHS when: surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically Cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the Cancer Drugs Fund. All these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive.

Different people deal with serious problems in different ways. It is hard to predict how knowing you have cancer will affect you. However, you and your loved ones may find it helpful to know about the feelings that people diagnosed with cancer have reported. Read about the emotional effects of cancer Recovering from surgery Surgeons and anaesthetists have found using an enhanced recovery programme after bowel cancer surgery helps patients recover more quickly. Most hospitals now use this programme. It involves giving you more information about what to expect before the operation, avoiding giving you strong laxatives to clean the bowel before surgery, and in some cases giving you a sugary drink two hours before the operation to give you energy. During and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of IV fluid you need very carefully, and after the operation you will be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day. Most people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation. To reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) , you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called heparin until you are fully mobile. A nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so you can go home within a few days. With the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. The timing depends on when you and the doctors and nurses looking after you agree you are well enough to go home. Diet after bowel surgery If you have had part of your colon removed, it is likely your stools (faeces) will be looser – one of the functions of the colon is to absorb water from stools. This may mean you need to go to the toilet more often to pass loose stools. Inform your care team if this becomes a problem, as medication is available to help control it. You may find some foods upset your bowels, particularly during the first few months after your operation. Different foods can upset different people. Food and drink known to cause problems include: fruit and vegetables that are high in fibre, such as beans, cabbages, apples and bananas fizzy drinks, such as cola and beer You may find it useful to keep a food diary to record the effects of different foods on your bowel. Contact your care team if you find you are having continual problems with your bowels as a result of your diet, or you are finding it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. You may need to be referred to a dietitian for further advice. Read more about Living with a stoma If you need a temporary or permanent stoma with an external bag or pouch, you may feel worried about how you look and how others will react to you. Information and advice about living with a stoma – including stoma care, stoma products and stoma-friendly diets – is available on the ileostomy and colostomy topics. For those who want further information about living with a stoma, there are patient support groups that provide support for people who may have had, or are due to have a stoma.

Bowel incontinence,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/bowel-incontinence/,About bowel incontinence ,"Read more about In severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence. Problems with the sphincter muscles The sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged. Diarrhoea The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence. The advice from NICE includes the following: limit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds) avoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables limit fresh and dried fruit to 3 portions a day and fruit juice to 1 small glass a day (make up the recommended ‘5 a day’ with vegetables) limit how often you have fizzy drinks and drinks containing caffeine avoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgers Constipation A high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you. Fibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include: fruit and vegetables beans wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta wholemeal bread seeds, nuts and oats Drink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass. Pelvic floor muscle training Pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles. A therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened. Exercises to try Check with your health professional before trying these at home. First, pretend you’re trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten. Next, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart. Squeeze your pelvic floor muscles for as long as you can, then relax. Repeat 5 times. Squeeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. Repeat 5 times. Squeeze the muscles quickly, then relax. Repeat 5 times. If you find these exercises too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine. Bowel retraining ","Diagnosing bowel incontinence . Bowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel. The most common problems are: problems with the rectum – the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it’s time to go to the toilet problems with the sphincter muscles – the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don’t work properly nerve damage – the nerve signals sent from the rectum don’t reach the brain These problems are explained in more detail below. It’s important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there’s a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bowel cancer . Problems with the rectum Constipation Constipation is a leading cause of bowel incontinence. In cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them. Watery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and happens most commonly in elderly people. Repeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence. Diarrhoea It’s difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with diarrhoea (particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence. Conditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include: Crohn’s disease – inflammation of the digestive system irritable bowel syndrome ulcerative colitis – inflammation of the large bowel These conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence. Haemorrhoids Haemorrhoids Sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery. Nerve damage Bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles. Damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including: diabetes multiple sclerosis (a condition of the central nervous system) stroke spina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system) An injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence. Other health conditions In some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as dementia A physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time. Diagnosing bowel incontinence ",,"About bowel incontinence Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It’s also sometimes known as faecal incontinence. The experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence. Other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind. Some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time. It’s thought 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it’s more common in elderly people. It’s also more common in women than men. Why bowel incontinence happens Bowel incontinence is a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition. Many cases are caused by diarrhoea , constipation , or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus. It can also be caused by long-term conditions such as diabetes , multiple sclerosis and dementia . Read more about the It’s important to remember that: bowel incontinence isn’t something to be ashamed of – it’s simply a medical problem that’s no different from diabetes or asthma bowel incontinence isn’t a normal part of ageing If you don’t want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence. Read more about diagnosing bowel incontinence . How bowel incontinence is treated lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the bowel medication to control diarrhoea and constipation surgery, of which there are a number of different options Incontinence products . any changes in your bowel habits lasting for more than a few weeks rectal bleeding stomach pains any changes to your diet any medication you’re taking Your GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They’ll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out a rectal examination, inserting a gloved finger into your bottom. A rectal examination will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working. Depending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests. Further tests Endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy) During an endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also be taken of the inside of your body. The endoscope checks whether there’s any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum. An endoscopy isn’t painful, but it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you. Anal manometry Anal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working. The test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end. It’s inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it’s not uncomfortable or painful. The device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon. You’ll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working. If the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don’t feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum. Ultrasound An ultrasound scan can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles. Defecography Defecography is a test used to study how you pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or prolapse that haven’t been discovered during a rectal examination. During this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to highlight problems using an X-ray . Once the barium is in place, you’ll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken. This test is occasionally carried out using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner instead of an X-ray. Continence products You may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS. Anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they’re not really a long term solution. If the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string. Disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence. When you’re out Wear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons. Disability Rights UK offers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the UK with a Radar NKS key . The key costs £4.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition. Dietary changes Bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet. There are 3 goals in bowel retraining: to improve the consistency of your stools to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves Changes to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above). Establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means finding the most convenient time when you can go to the toilet without being rushed. Ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger. Biofeedback Biofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom. The sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer. You’re then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you are performing the exercises in the right way. Medication Medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence. Loperamide is a medicine widely used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time. Laxatives are used to treat constipation. They’re a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended. These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Enemas or rectal irrigation These procedures involve a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum. Surgery An operation called a colostomy Sphincteroplasty A sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger. Sacral nerve stimulation The most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct. Read the NICE guidelines on Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence . Tibial nerve stimulation NICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. Read the NICE guidelines on . Injectable bulking agents Bulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them. The use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there’s little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety. Read the NICE guidelines on . Endoscopic heat therapy Heat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently produced guidelines on this procedure. NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. As well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials. Read the NICE guidelines on . Artificial sphincter An artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles. This operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus. The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed. A tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in women it’s placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin. The pump is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes. The use of an artificial sphincter is a relatively new procedure, so there isn’t much good-quality information about its long-term effectiveness and safety. Possible problems include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems. Read the NICE guidelines on . Colostomy A colostomy A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening. ",
Bowel polyps,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/bowel-polyps/,,"Polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms: some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as a sessile polyp some look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together Bowel polyps are not usually cancerous, although if they’re discovered they’ll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated. Some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few. They tend to occur in people over the age of 60. How are they caused? Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly. There may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer. However, some larger polyps can cause: a small amount of rectal bleeding (blood in your stool) mucus to be produced when you open your bowels diarrhoea or constipation abdominal pain How are they discovered? Bowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during screening for bowel cancer . If polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps. How are they treated? ",,,"Both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp. In rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large. After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if: the polyp has been completely removed there is any risk of it regrowing there is any cancerous change in the polyp Outlook Some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but means you’ll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals. You might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3 to 5 years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer. ",

Blood tests and other tests Your GP might check your pulse and blood pressure. Sometimes an (electrocardiogram (ECG) may be needed to check how well your heart is working. Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of: fluids in your body chemicals or minerals, like potassium in your blood Complications of bulimia There are physical complications associated with bulimia. These can include: dental problems – regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay repeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a sore throat due to a lack of nutrients, your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle your saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder frequent use of laxatives can damage your bowel muscles, causing permanent constipation (finding it difficult to poo) an increased risk of heart problems Frequent vomiting or laxative use can cause: tiredness weakness abnormal heart rhythms kidney damage convulsions (fits) muscle spasms If you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile. While it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.

Learn more about talking therapies Medication Antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. They can reduce the urges to binge and vomit. The medication will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually start on a low dose. The dose will gradually increase as your body adjusts to the medicine. Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It’s best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.

Brain stem death,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/brain-stem-death/,"Brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe. When this happens, a ventilator keeps the person’s heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream. A person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost. Confirming death Confirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function. Confirming death is now more complex, because it’s possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won’t ever regain consciousness or start breathing again. Once the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there’s no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used. To save a person’s family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there’s clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the ventilator. The brain stem The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that’s connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column). The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body’s automatic functions that are essential for life. These include: breathing heartbeat blood pressure swallowing The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain’s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement. After brain death, it’s not possible for someone to remain conscious. How brain death occurs Brain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by: cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen heart attack – a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked stroke – a serious medical emergency that happens when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body Brain death can also occur as a result of: a severe head injury a brain haemorrhage infections, such as encephalitis a brain tumour Vegetative state There’s a difference between brain death and a vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage. Someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness – for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings. In rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings. However, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that: some form of consciousness may exist breathing unaided is usually possible there’s a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem’s core functions may be unaffected A person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support. Confirming brain death Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead. These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C). Therefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, like shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light. Organ and tissue donation After brain death has occurred, it may be possible for the person’s organs and tissue to be used in transplantations. This can often save or improve the lives of others. Only 1% of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible. This means every opportunity for donation is very precious. Specialist nurses will discuss the possibility of donation with families. This’ll be done in a sensitive way. They’ll also check the NHS Organ Donor Register to see if the person had recorded a donation decision and share this information with the family. This lets the family know what their loved one wanted. It also means that nurses can check if this was their latest view. Further information about organ and tissue donation Diagnosing brain stem death There are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain stem death. ","an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia) severe under-activity of the thyroid gland ",,"a person must be unconscious and fail to respond to outside stimulation a person’s heartbeat and breathing can only be maintained using a ventilator there must be clear evidence that serious brain damage has occurred and it can’t be cured Ruling out other conditions The doctors will explain the tests to you and they’ll keep you informed about your loved one’s condition at all times. Tests The tests used to determine whether brain stem death has occurred are outlined below: A torch is shone into both eyes to see if they react to the light. The cornea (transparent outer layer of the eye), which is usually very sensitive, is stroked with a tissue or piece of cotton wool to see if the eye reacts. Pressure is applied to the forehead and the nose is pinched to see if there’s any movement in response. Ice-cold water is inserted into each ear, which would usually cause the eyes to move. A thin, plastic tube is placed down the trachea (windpipe) to see if it provokes gagging or coughing. The person is disconnected from the ventilator for a short period of time to see if they make any attempt to breathe on their own. Brain death will be diagnosed if a person fails to respond to all of these tests. Occasionally, a person’s limbs or torso (the upper part of the body) may move, even after brain stem death has been diagnosed. ",,
Brain tumours: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/brain-tumours-children/,Brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. Children of any age may be affected. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls. ,"headaches (often worse in the morning) vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick fits (seizures) feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things eye problems, such as abnormal eye movements, blurring or double vision feeling very tired much more quickly than usual feeling extremely sleepy (drowsy) for no reason The brain The brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are 3 layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between 2 of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord. The main parts of the brain are: the cerebrum – this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain; it’s made up of 2 halves (hemispheres), it controls thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, emotions and touch, and it also helps us be aware of our body position the cerebellum – this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination the brain stem – this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck; it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing What happens when a brain tumour is suspected Knowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don’t be afraid to ask questions. Your doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. This will include looking into the back of your child’s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. They’ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes. CT or MRI scan Most children will have a CT or an MRI scan , which looks in detail at the inside of the brain. A CT scan uses X-rays . It’s quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an MRI. It uses quite a lot of X-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided. An MRI scan uses no X-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. Machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. It is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan. Ordinary X-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours. Blood tests These are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour. Biopsy It’s often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour ( biopsy ) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. It means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. The piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by a specialist doctor called a pathologist. A biopsy isn’t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. In this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known. Sometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. Part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later. Types of brain tumours There are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign brain tumours Steroids Anticonvulsants These are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. They may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer. ","Radiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the MRI scans of your child’s brain. The process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for 5 or 6 weeks. Sometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. Your child’s oncologist will explain more about this. Chemotherapy ",Radiotherapy ,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Brain tumours A tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). This information is about primary brain tumours. The most common tumour of this type is a low-grade astrocytoma (also called low-grade glioma). Malignant primary brain tumours These are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by. High-grade astrocytoma and ependymoma These tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas. Medulloblastomas Surgery Usually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Operations can be very long. It’s not uncommon for these to be more than 6 or 8 hours. After the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them. Other medicines your child may need to take Your child’s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects your child is having. Many side effects can be well controlled or made easier. Hair loss Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause hair loss . Your child’s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy. Tiredness Feeling sick Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. This can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child. Increased risk of an infection Chemotherapy can increase the risk of infection. It’s important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straight away if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell. Skin changes in the treated area if your child is having radiotherapy Radiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. The skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. You’ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area. Clinical trials Specialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. You can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care You can contact your child’s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health. Long-term side effects Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Breast cancer (female),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/breast-cancer-female/,About breast cancer ,"Most breast lumps aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also speak to your GP if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer. Learn more about the After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This might include a mammography (breast screening) or a biopsy . Read more about breast screening and how breast cancer is diagnosed Types of breast cancer There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types. Non-invasive breast cancer Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn’t developed the ability to spread outside the breast. This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Invasive breast cancer Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn’t necessarily mean it has spread. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called ‘no special type’. Other types of breast cancer Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget’s disease of the breast . It’s possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it’s known as ‘secondary’ or ‘metastatic’ breast cancer. Breast cancer screening There’s a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it’s vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. Mammographic screening (where X-ray images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery. Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years. Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73. Read more about breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near you The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast. Most breast lumps (90%) aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following: a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast Breast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Breast awareness It’s important to be breast aware, so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot potential problems.

Mammogram and breast ultrasound If you’re under 40 years of age, the specialist may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn’t as effective as an ultrasound for diagnosing breast disease. If you have a mammogram, it will produce an X-ray of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan . Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid. Read more about breast screening Biopsy A biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it’s cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected. Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition. Different methods of carrying out a biopsy are discussed below. Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue. Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You’ll have a local anaesthetic , which means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.

Soon after a mastectomy, you’ll be given a lightweight foam breast to wear until the area affected by surgery or radiotherapy has healed. After it’s healed, you’ll be offered a silicone prosthesis. Prostheses come in many different shapes and sizes, and you should be able to find one that suits you. Read further information: , hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods, and nausea and vomiting. Your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery. ","Diagnosing breast cancer Read more about preventing breast cancer Living with breast cancer However, there are risk factors that are known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can’t do anything about, but there are some you can change. Age The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the menopause . About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50. All women who are 50 to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit. Read more about breast screening Family history If you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer , you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it’s possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance. Most cases of breast cancer aren’t hereditary (they don’t run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It’s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. If you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you’re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP. Read about predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes Being tall If you’re taller than average, you’re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who’s shorter than average. The reason for this isn’t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones. Alcohol Your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink . Radiation Certain medical procedures that use radiation, like X-rays and computerised tomography (CT) scans , may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer. If you had radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. Speak to your GP if you weren’t contacted, or if you didn’t attend a consultation.

Previous benign breast lump A benign breast lump doesn’t mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely. Breast density Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous. Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense. Exposure to oestrogen The female hormone, oestrogen, can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start puberty , to regulate your periods. Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your periods at a young age and experienced the menopause at a late age, you’ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy. Being overweight or obese If you’ve experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.

Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men can also get breast cancer . If it’s treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. The breasts The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed. The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they’re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Read more about the If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy Read more about Preventing breast cancer Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight , exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol . Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT. Read further information: Breast Cancer Now: Scans and X-rays Computerised tomography (CT) scans , or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast. If your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it’s been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera. In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone. If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as ‘hormone therapy’. During a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they’re known as ‘hormone receptor positive’. While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as ‘biological’ or ‘targeted’ therapy. Stage and grade of breast cancer Stage of breast cancer When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer: stage 1 – the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren’t affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 2 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 3 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 4 – the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis) This is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you’re not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor. TNM staging system Secondary breast cancer Most breast cancers are discovered in the condition’s early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it’s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis). Read further information about secondary breast cancer Surgery There are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. They are: surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a mastectomy In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed. Breast-conserving surgery Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where up to a quarter of the breast is removed. If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the: type of cancer you have size of the tumour and where it is in your breast amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed size of your breasts Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there’s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there’s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast. After having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells. Mastectomy A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy. If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm). Reconstruction Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast. Read further information about breast reconstruction Lymph node surgery To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out. The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They’re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they’re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye. The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread. If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It’s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are: breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis) radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes The side effects of radiotherapy include: irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin fatigue (extreme tiredness) lymphoedema (excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm) Read further information about radiotherapy for breast cancer Chemotherapy Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It’s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven’t been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it’s spread. The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include: infections loss of appetite nausea and vomiting tiredness hair loss sore mouth Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe. Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers. However, this doesn’t always happen and you may enter an early menopause Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body. These types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects. You’ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it’s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove. In most cases, you’ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after having surgery. If your breast cancer isn’t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It’s taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including: tiredness changes to your periods nausea and vomiting hot flushes aching joints headaches weight gain Aromatase inhibitors If you’ve experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries. Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include: hot flushes and sweats lack of interest in sex (loss of libido) nausea and vomiting tiredness aching joints and bone pain headaches skin rashes Ovarian ablation or suppression In women who haven’t experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen. Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It stops the ovaries working permanently and means you’ll experience the menopause early. If you’re approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin. Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including: hot flushes and sweats mood swings trouble sleeping Read further information about hormone therapy Biological therapy (targeted therapy) Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells. If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin, is usually used after chemotherapy. Trastuzumab Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive. Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It’s also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection). Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina , uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll have regular tests on your heart to make sure it’s not causing any problems. Other side effects of trastuzumab may include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and pains Clinical trials These advances were discovered in clinical trials All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they’re worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those in routine care. If you’re asked to take part in a trial, you’ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.

Regular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. If you have been through the menopause , it’s particularly important that you’re not overweight or obese . This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Breastfeeding Studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t. The reasons aren’t fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they’re breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable. Your level of risk is determined by factors such as your age, your family’s medical history and the results of genetic tests. Mastectomy A mastectomy is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families. By removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%. However, like all operations, there’s a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships. If you want to, you can usually choose to have breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body. An alternative is to use breast prostheses. These are artificial breasts that can be worn inside your bra. Read more about Medication In 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who’ve been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t. These medications may not be suitable if in the past you’ve had blood clots or womb cancer , or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. Women who’ve already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small. Raloxifene can cause side effects including Read further information: ",

Bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells: red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells, which help fight infection platelets, which help stop bleeding The bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells. Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. Despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children. pale skin feeling tired and breathless having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above night sweats bone and joint pain easily bruised skin swollen lymph nodes (glands) abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen unexplained weight loss a purple skin rash (purpura) headaches seizures (fits) vomiting blurred vision dizziness When to seek medical advice consolidation – this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning Consolidation high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness Avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower. While it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour. Also ensure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as: the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccine Bleeding If you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur.

","Diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia exposure to high levels of radiation exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes Read more information about the Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced. The white blood cells are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells. Risk factors Genetic disorders A small number of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. For example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children with Down’s syndrome . Radiation exposure Exposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. However, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl. Due to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such as X-rays , are rarely used on pregnant women. Most cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation. Possible environmental factors Experts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia: living near a nuclear power station living near a power line living near a building or facility that releases electromagnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast At the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increase the risk of developing leukaemia. Benzene Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. However, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. Benzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. People who have had chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia. Other risk factors There is some evidence to show an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in people who: are obese have a weakened immune system – due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant Diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia The first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your GP to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample. ",The haematologist will use a local anaesthetic to numb the skin over a bone – usually the hip bone – and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. The bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and – if found – the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time. Further tests There are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These tests are described below. Cytogenetic testing ,"Complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia About acute lymphoblastic leukaemia Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are 2 main types: lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage These pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia Warning signs of acute leukaemia Bone marrow biopsy Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Lymph node biopsy If you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread. CT scans If you have acute leukaemia, a computerised tomography scan (CT scan) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. Chest X-ray An X-ray may be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes. Lumbar puncture If it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be carried out. A lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. The fluid is tested to determine whether the leukaemia has reached your nervous system. acute myeloid leukaemia . Induction blood transfusions as it’s likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells. You will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent further infection. Chemotherapy You will be given chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube into a vein in your chest (called a central line). Some chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to a lumbar puncture . Side effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. They can include: nausea vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes infertility hair loss Steroid therapy You may also be given corticosteroid injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Imatinib If you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells. Imatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include: nausea vomiting swelling in the face and lower legs muscle cramps rash diarrhoea Maintenance The maintenance phase can often last for two years. Dasatinib Dasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia: to sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below) Side effects of both types of radiotherapy include: hair loss nausea fatigue Many younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty. A small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery. Read more about cataracts Bone marrow and stem cell transplants Transplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister. Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body. This can put a big strain on the body so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. Read about bone marrow transplantation for more information Complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia Being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia. There are 2 reasons for this: the lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat acute leukaemia can weaken the immune system This means that you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications. You may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics People who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Read more about infertility Psychological effects of leukaemia You may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups. Another excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support . Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and is open Monday to Friday, 9am–8pm.

The tumour can: cause fits affect the messages sent by that part of the brain to other parts of the body cause ‘raised intracranial pressure’ – there’s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the brain headaches, which are often worse in the morning vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick fits (seizures) feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things like friends, school or going out problems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double feeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual changes in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body problems with speech personality changes tests to find out more, or refer you to a specialist doctor. We also have more info about: having tests for brain tumours At the hospital They’ll usually check: your balance your coordination your muscle strength your reflexes whether you can feel pinpricks on areas of your skin You might also have your eyesight and hearing tested. Tests anticonvulsant medicines that help prevent fits (seizures) Surgery for brain tumours Your surgeon will usually try to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour. Before the operation, they will talk to you about what’s involved and the benefits and risks of the operation. It’s important you understand all this, so ask all the questions you want to. You’ll usually be in hospital for a week, sometimes longer. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what to expect before and after the operation as it can be different for everyone. Before the operation you’ll probably need to have some of your hair shaved off. This is done in the anaesthetic room. You may prefer to have all your hair shaved off. You can cover up with a wig or hat while it grows back. For some types of brain tumours, particularly low-grade gliomas, your surgeon might suggest doing an operation while you are awake. This is called an ‘awake craniotomy’. If you need this, you will be given plenty of medication to make sure it doesn’t hurt. Late effects It’s important to take steroids as your doctor tells you and not to suddenly stop them. If you take steroids for more than 2 weeks, it’s important to tell your doctor about them if you are unwell (for example an infection) over the next 6 months. This is because you may need an extra course of steroids. Side effects If you take steroids for some time, you may have some temporary side effects. These can include: weight gain a change in the shape of your face (making it more rounded) indigestion slightly more risk of getting an infection mood changes (feeling ‘hyper’ or overactive or feeling low) increase in the sugar level in your blood – your blood or urine may be tested to check for this Side effects can be hard to cope with, especially with all the other stuff you have to deal with. Remember – the side effects will gradually get better when the steroids are stopped, and in the meantime there are lots of people who can support you. Anticonvulsants Tumours in the brain can sometimes cause fits. Anticonvulsant drugs can help prevent them. You might be prescribed these before surgery, or to take on a more long-term basis. Your doctors will tell you about any side effects of these drugs. We also have more information about: having tests for brain tumours the brain If you’re looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. ","The cause of most brain tumours is unknown. Research is looking into this all the time. Young people with rare genetic conditions that run in families, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2, have an increased chance of developing a brain tumour. Remember – nothing you’ve done has caused the tumour. If you’re worried about brain tumours Being more at risk of an infection You need to let your doctor or nurse know immediately if you have signs of an infection like feeling hot and shivery. This is because you can become unwell quite quickly while you are on chemotherapy. Tiredness This is a common side effect so it’s important to get plenty of rest. Try to balance rest with some gentle exercise like short walks if you can. This helps give you more energy and keeps your muscles toned. Feeling sick You’ll be given anti-sickness medicines to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if the ones you’re taking aren’t working for you. Hair loss ","Macmillan Cancer Support has information on the possible tests, which include: a CT scan or MRI scan – these show a detailed picture of the inside of your head blood tests – these are done to check your general health and sometimes to measure the level of certain chemicals or hormones in your blood lumbar punctures – in this test a small needle is used to collect some fluid from the base of your spine; it’s sometimes done to look for cancer cells in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord X-rays – might be taken to check your skull and chest Having a biopsy Doctors often need to remove a small part of the tumour ( biopsy ) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. The piece of tumour that’s removed is looked at under a microscope by a doctor called a pathologist. The operation will be done under general anaesthetic . This is where you are put into a deep sleep. You’ll probably be in hospital for a few days. An MRI or CT scan is used to find the exact position of the tumour. The surgeon makes a small hole in the skull and passes a fine needle through it to remove a piece of the tumour. Guided biopsy This is often used to make sure the doctor takes the biopsy from the most appropriate part of the tumour. You will have a head frame fitted that will help guide the surgeon to exactly the right place before they take the biopsy. This is called a stereotactic biopsy. Tests and waiting for results Having tests and waiting for results can be scary. Remember – you don’t have to keep your worries to yourself. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. You could also talk to one of Macmillan’s cancer support specialists on their free helpline. This information is about having tests for brain tumours. We also have more information about: ","The brain and brain tumours This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about the brain and different types of brain tumour. Any illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help. The brain The brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the ‘control centre’ which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The brain and the spinal cord are covered by 3 thin layers of tissue called the meninges. Between 2 of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The meninges and CSF help to protect the brain and spinal cord. The main parts of the brain are the: cerebrum cerebellum brain stem pituitary gland Cerebrum This is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It’s made up of 2 halves called hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. It also makes us aware of our body position. Cerebellum This is at the back of the head, near the middle. It controls movement, balance and coordination. Brain stem This connects the brain to the spinal cord. It’s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing. Pituitary gland This is in the middle of the brain. It makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods, and sperm production. Types of brain tumour There are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types. Some benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. This can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain. Malignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. They can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord. This information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. Sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. These are known as secondary brain tumours. The types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are: pituitary tumours gliomas medulloblastomas germ cell tumours Gliomas These start in cells called glial cells. There are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. These types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord. Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas These are the most common type of glioma. Astrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. Oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. Sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. These are called oligoastrocytomas. Doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). They can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope. Ependymomas These are a rarer type of glioma. They develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. These tumours can spread to other parts of the brain and spine through the CSF. Pituitary tumours These are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. They are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas. Some cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. They very rarely spread. Medulloblastomas These usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. Sometimes they can spread through the CSF, or very rarely to other parts of the body. They start from cells that haven’t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET). Germ cell tumours of the brain This type of tumour is rare. They develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue. Although germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. They may be non-cancerous or cancerous. They are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.

This section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults. a neurosurgeon, who specialises in brain operations a neurologist, who treats brain conditions a cancer specialist (oncologist), who treats brain tumours with radiotherapy and chemotherapy surgery – an operation to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour radiotherapy – uses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells chemotherapy – uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells Medicines you may need to take What happens after the operation? After the operation you are monitored very closely for the first 12 to 24 hours. At first you might be attached to a machine called a ventilator that helps you breathe. Your nurse or doctor will tell you if this is likely to happen. Your head might be bandaged and you’ll have a tube draining any extra blood that’s collected around the wound into a plastic bottle. You may also have another tube draining extra cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain). This is to make sure you don’t get too much pressure building up inside your brain. Your doctor will remove these tubes as soon as it’s safe, usually after a couple of days. You’ll have a drip to give you fluids until you’re eating and drinking again. There may be some swelling and bruising around your face and eyes. This will settle down after a few days. When you wake up you might have a headache. You’ll be given painkillers regularly until this eases off. Tell your nurse or doctor if you’re in pain so that they can give you something stronger. Radiotherapy for brain tumours Radiotherapy uses high-energy X-rays to treat cancer cells. It can be used: after the operation to treat any cells that may have been left behind instead of an operation when a brain tumour doesn’t need to be or can’t be removed if a brain tumour comes back after surgery For some brain tumours, it’s normal to treat your spinal cord (the nerves that go from your brain to your body) as well as your brain. Your doctor will tell you if this is the case. Types of radiotherapy There are 3 types of radiotherapy that are used to treat brain tumours: photon radiotherapy (given at your local hospital) proton radiotherapy (until 2018/2019 this is given in Switzerland or America) stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (given at specialist hospitals in the UK) Side effects The side effects you might have will depend on the type of radiotherapy you’re having and how long it lasts for. Your doctor and specialist nurse will tell you more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects you’re having. There’s usually something they can do to make things easier. Hair loss lose your hair . Losing your hair can be scary and really upsetting. There are lots of ways to cover up with hats, bandannas, baseball caps, scarves, or wigs until it grows back. Getting a shorter haircut before it starts to fall out sometimes makes it a little easier to cope with. Although hair loss is usually temporary, for some people it can be permanent. Your specialist will usually be able to tell you if this is likely. This can be hard to deal with and you’ll be given advice and support to help you cope. Skin changes Tiredness Feeling sick Let your doctor know if this is a problem. They can prescribe anti-sickness medicines to help. Headaches It’s important to tell your doctor if you have headaches. They can prescribe pain relief for you. Chemotherapy for brain tumours Chemotherapy is the use of special anti-cancer drugs to destroy tumour cells. You might have chemotherapy: to shrink a tumour to make it easier to remove with surgery when it’s not possible to remove the tumour completely with surgery during radiotherapy to make the tumour more sensitive to radiation after radiotherapy or surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour coming back (adjuvant chemotherapy) Chemotherapy drugs Macmillan has information on the different chemotherapy drugs that can be used, such as: lomustine (CCNU) procarbazine vincristine cisplatin or carboplatin temozolomide (Temodal®) cyclophosphamide ifosfamide etoposide The information on these drugs is written for people of all ages, not just for young people. There are lots of other drugs that are used and your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this. You can also call Macmillan’s cancer support specialists for more information about chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy can be given as a single drug or in combination with others. They can be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. Occasionally chemotherapy is given directly into the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy) or into the brain through a special device (ommaya reservoir). Side effects Infertility Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about the side effects to expect depending on the chemotherapy you have. Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects as there’s often something that can be done to control them. Steroids ",
Bronchitis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/bronchitis/,About bronchitis ,". When to see your GP Most cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and plenty of fluids. your cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks you have a constant fever (a temperature of 38°C – 100.4°F – or above) for more than three days you cough up mucus streaked with blood you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as asthma or heart failure Your GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as pneumonia If your GP thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. You will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem. Read more about The main symptom of bronchitis is a hacking cough. It is likely that your cough will bring up thick yellow-grey mucus (phlegm), although this does not always happen. common cold or sinusitis , and may include: sore throat headache runny or blocked nose aches and pains tiredness Some people may experience shortness of breath or wheezing, due to inflamed airways. However, this is more common with long-term (chronic) bronchitis. Long-term (chronic) bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is often known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . wheezing increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around a persistent cough that brings up mucus (phlegm) frequent chest infections When to see your GP See your GP as soon as possible if: your cough is very severe or lasts longer than three weeks you have a constant fever (a temperature of 38°C – 100.4°F – or above) for more than three days – this may be a sign of flu or a more serious condition, such as pneumonia you cough up mucus streaked with blood you develop rapid breathing (more than 30 breaths a minute) or chest pains you become drowsy or confused you have had repeated bouts of bronchitis You should also contact your GP if you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as: asthma heart failure – weakness in the heart that leads to fluid in your lungs emphysema – damage to the small airways in your lungs There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but healthy living will help. In particular, you should stop smoking , if you smoke. If you have bronchitis: get plenty of rest drink lots of fluids – this helps prevent dehydration and thins the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up treat headaches, fever, and aches and pains with paracetamol or ibuprofen – although ibuprofen is not recommended if you have asthma There is little evidence that cough medicines work – Stopping smoking is also very important if you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis or COPD. Read more about the ","Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed. Read more about the . Complications Pneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid. 1 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia. People at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include: elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease people with a weakened immune system Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital. Read more about the The bronchitis infection can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common. In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold or flu . The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else. Everyday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards, may have traces of the virus on them. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets. Breathing in irritant substances Bronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke. Smoking is the main cause of long-term (chronic) bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as smokers themselves. Read information about . You can also read the Health and Safety Executive’s report on COPD in Great Britain attributed to occupational exposure (PDF, 275 KB). ",,"About bronchitis Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed. The main symptom is a cough , which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause a sore throat and wheezing. Read more about the . Why do I have bronchitis? The bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles. The walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation. . Who is affected Acute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits. Acute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a cold , sore throat or flu . It is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the UK affected by chronic bronchitis. Most of these are adults over the age of 50. . Occupational exposure You may also be at risk of bronchitis and other forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if you are often exposed to materials that can damage your lungs, such as: grain dust textiles (fabric fibres) ammonia strong acids chlorine This is sometimes referred to as ‘occupational bronchitis’, and usually eases once you are no longer exposed to the irritant substance. Read more information about the . The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recommended that over-the-counter cough medicines should not be given to children under the age of six. As an alternative to an over-the-counter cough medicine, try making your own mixture of honey and lemon, which can help soothe a sore throat and ease your cough. Stop smoking If you smoke, you should stop immediately. Smoking aggravates bronchitis and increases your risk of developing a long-term (chronic) condition. Stopping smoking while you have bronchitis can also be the perfect opportunity to quit altogether. Antibiotics when to see your GP . Your GP will not routinely prescribe antibiotics Your GP will only prescribe antibiotics if you have an increased risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia . Antibiotics may be recommended for: premature babies elderly people over the age of 80 people with a history of heart, lung, kidney or liver disease people with cystic fibrosis If you are prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, it is likely to be a five-day course of amoxicillin, oxytetracycline or doxycycline. Possible side effects of these medicines include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but they are uncommon. Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is treated in the same way as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For example: a type of medication called mucolytics can be used to make mucus easier to cough up . ",

While persistent coughing may not necessarily be the result of bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation. Some people with bronchiectasis are given a stock of antibiotics as a precaution, in case they suddenly develop a lung infection. When to seek immediate medical advice Some people with bronchiectasis develop a severe lung infection that may need to be treated in hospital. a bluish tinge to the skin and lips (cyanosis) confusion a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above rapid breathing (more than 25 breaths a minute) severe chest pain that makes it too painful to cough and clear your lungs If you experience any of the above, phone the healthcare professional in charge of your care immediately. This may be your GP, a doctor who specialises in lung conditions (pulmonologist) or a specialist nurse. If this isn’t possible, then phone the NHS 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service. It is estimated that cystic fibrosis is responsible for around 1 in 33 cases of bronchiectasis. Cilia abnormalities Cilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs. They are designed to protect the airways and help move away any excess mucus. Bronchiectasis can develop if there is a problem with the cilia that means they are unable to effectively clear mucus from the airways. Conditions that can cause problems with the cilia include: Young’s disease – a rare condition only affecting males that is thought to be caused by exposure to mercury in childhood primary ciliary dyskinesia – a rare condition caused by inheriting faulty genes It’s estimated that about 1 in every 33 cases of bronchiectasis are caused by Young’s disease and 1 or 2 in every 100 cases are caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, as the regulations regarding the use of mercury are now much stricter than they were in the past, it is expected that Young’s syndrome will become a much less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future. Connective tissue diseases Certain conditions that cause inflammation in other areas of the body are sometimes associated with bronchiectasis, including: rheumatoid arthritis Sjögren’s syndrome Crohn’s disease ulcerative colitis These conditions are usually thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Diagnosing bronchiectasis You should see your GP for advice if you develop a persistent cough, so they can look for a possible cause. They may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out. The lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise as a person breaths in and out. You’ll also probably have a chest X-ray lung cancer . If your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of your phlegm, so it can be checked for bacteria. Referral to a specialist stopping smoking (if you smoke) having the flu vaccine every year making sure you have had the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia exercising regularly keeping yourself well hydrated eating a balanced diet Exercises There are a range of exercises, known as airway clearance techniques, which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. This can often help improve coughing and breathlessness in people with bronchiectasis. You can be referred to a physiotherpist, who can teach you these techniques. Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) The most widely used technique in the UK is called active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT). ACBT involves you repeating a cycle made up of a number of different steps. These include a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up; then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes. Don’t attempt ACBT if you haven’t first been taught the steps by a suitably trained physiotherapist, as performing the techniques incorrectly could damage your lungs. If you’re otherwise in good health, you’ll probably only need to perform ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to perform ACBT on a more frequent basis. Postural drainage Changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage. Each technique can involve several complex steps, but most techniques involve you leaning or lying down while the physiotherapist or a carer uses their hands to vibrate certain sections of your lungs as you go through a series of “huffing” and coughing. Devices There are also a number of handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs. Although these devices look different, most work in a similar way. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus. Examples of these devices include the flutter, the RC cornet and the Acapella. However, these devices aren’t always available on the NHS, so you may have to pay for one yourself. They usually cost £45 to £60. Medication In some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed. These are discussed below. Nebulised medications Occasionally, medication inhaled through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended to help make it easier for you to clear your lungs. Nebulisers are devices consisting of a face mask or mouthpiece, a chamber to convert the medication into a fine mist, and a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs. A number of different medications can be administered using a nebuliser, including salt water solutions. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your phlegm so it’s easier to cough it out. Nebulisers can also be used to administer antibiotics, if necessary (see below). However, while the medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription, the nebuliser device itself isn’t always available on the NHS. In some areas, a local respiratory service may provide the device without charge, but if this isn’t an option, you may have to pay for a device. Bronchodilators Bronchodilators are inhaled medications that help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include beta2-adrenergic agonist, anticholinergics and theophylline. Antibiotics antibiotics . A sample of phlegm will be taken to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection, although you’ll be initially treated with an antibiotic known to be effective against a number of different bacteria (a broad spectrum antibiotic) because it can take a few days to get the test results. Depending on the test results, you may be prescribed a different antibiotic, or in some cases, a combination of antibiotics known to be effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection. If you’re well enough to be treated at home, you’ll probably be prescribed two to three antibiotic tablets a day for 10-14 days. It’s important to finish the course even if you feel better, as stopping the course prematurely could cause the infection to recur quickly. for a detailed description) you may need to be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotic injections. This could involve taking low-dose antibiotic tablets to minimise the risk of side effects, or using an antibiotic nebuliser (see above for more information about nebulisers). Using antibiotics in this way does increase the risk that one or more types of bacteria will develop a resistance to the antibiotic. Therefore, you may be asked to give regular phlegm samples to check for any resistance. If bacteria do show signs of developing a resistance, then your antibiotic may need to be changed. Surgery The lungs are made up of sections known as lobes – the left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes. Surgery for focal bronchiectasis would usually involve removing the lobe affected by the bronchiectasis in a type of operation known as a lobectomy. Surgery won’t be used if more than one lobe is affected, as it’s too dangerous to remove so much lung tissue. Complications of bronchiectasis coughing up more than 100ml of blood in a 24-hour period – 100ml is roughly equivalent to a third of a can of drink breathing difficulties – caused by blood obstructing your airways feeling lightheaded, dizzy and having cold, clammy skin – caused by rapid blood loss Massive haemoptysis is a medical emergency. If you think someone is experiencing massive haemoptysis, then phone 999 for an ambulance. A person with massive haemoptysis needs to be admitted to hospital and a tube may need to be placed into their throat to assist them with their breathing. A procedure called a bronchial artery embolisation (BAE), carried out by specialist radiology doctors, will then be required to stop the bleeding. During a BAE, a special dye is injected into your arteries so they show up clearly on X-rays . Then, using X-ray scans as a guide, the source of the bleeding is located and injected with tiny particles, around the size of a grain of sand, that will help clog the vessel up and stop the bleeding. ","Diagnosing bronchiectasis a lung infection during childhood, such as pneumonia or whooping cough , that damages the bronchi underlying problems with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) – an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi are inhaled However, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis). Read more about the . Who is affected Bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It’s estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition. Bronchiectasis is caused by the airways of the lungs becoming damaged and widened. This can be due to an infection or another condition. Sometimes, the cause is not known. Your lungs are continually exposed to germs, so your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection. If a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. These cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the surrounding tissue to become inflamed. For most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. However, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen. The abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. If the lungs do become infected again, this can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi. As this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse. How quickly bronchiectasis progresses can vary significantly. For some people, the condition will get worse quickly, but for many the progression is slow. In around half of all cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause can be found. Some of the more common triggers that have been identified are described below. Childhood infections Around a third of cases of bronchiectasis in adults are associated with a severe lung infection in childhood, such as: severe pneumonia whooping cough tuberculosis (TB) measles However, as there are now vaccinations available for these infections, it is expected that childhood infections will become a less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future. Immunodeficiency Around 1 in 12 cases of bronchiectasis occur because a person has a weakened immune system, which makes their lungs more vulnerable to tissue damage. The medical term for having a weakened immune system is immunodeficiency. Some people are born with an immunodeficiency because of problems with the genes they inherit from their parents. It’s also possible to acquire an immunodeficiency after an infection such as HIV . Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) Around 1 in 14 people with bronchiectasis develop the condition as a complication of an allergic condition known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). People with ABPA have an allergy to a type of fungi known as aspergillus, which is found in a wide range of different environments across the world. If a person with ABPA breathes in fungal spores, it can trigger an allergic reaction and persistent inflammation, which in turn can progress to bronchiectasis. Aspiration Aspiration is the medical term for stomach contents accidentally passing into your lungs, rather than down into your gastrointestinal tract. This is responsible for around 1 in 25 cases of bronchiectasis. The lungs are very sensitive to the presence of foreign objects, such as small samples of food or even stomach acids, so this can trigger inflammation leading to bronchiectasis. Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis ",,"Complications of bronchiectasis About bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. Read more about diagnosing bronchiectasis . How the lungs are affected The lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream. The inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs. In bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further. Over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs. Why it happens Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed. exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs medication to help improve airflow within the lungs antibiotics to treat any lung infections that develop Read more about the . Possible complications Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it. Read more about the complications of bronchiectasis . Outlook The outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause. The maximum time you should have to wait for referral is 18 weeks, although you may not have to wait as long as this. Read more about waiting times. Some of the tests a respiratory consultant may carry out to help diagnose bronchiectasis are described below. HRCT scan Currently, the most effective test available to diagnose bronchiectasis is called a high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) scan. A HRCT scan involves taking several X-rays of your chest at slightly different angles. A computer is then used to put all the images together. This produces a very detailed picture of the inside of your body and the airways inside your lungs (the bronchi) should show up very clearly. In a healthy pair of lungs, the bronchi should become narrower the further they spread into your lungs, in the same way a tree branch separates into narrower branches and twigs. If the scan shows that a section of airways is actually getting wider, this usually confirms bronchiectasis. Other tests Other tests can be used to assess the state of your lungs and to try to determine what the underlying cause of your bronchiectasis may be. These tests may include: blood tests – to check how well your immune system is working and check for infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi phlegm (sputum) test – to check for bacteria or fungi a sample of your sweat can be tested to see how much salt is in it – high levels of salt can be caused by cystic fibrosis (if this test is positive, then a more detailed genetic test can be carried out; see diagnosing cystic fibrosis for further information) lung function test – a small, hand-held device (spirometer) that you blow into is used to measure how hard and how quickly you can expel air from your lungs; this can assess how well your lungs are working bronchoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera at one end is used to look into your lungs; this is usually only required if you think you’ve inhaled a foreign object Coughing up large amounts of blood A rare, but serious, complication of bronchiectasis is coughing up large amounts of blood (the medical term for this is massive haemoptysis). This can occur when a section of one of the blood vessels supplying the lungs suddenly splits open. ",
Cerebral palsy,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/cerebral-palsy/,"Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by either damage to the brain, or abnormal development of the brain. This damage normally occurs before birth or during a child’s early development. Cerebral palsy is not normally progressive in nature.

People with cerebral palsy often go on to live long, rich and rewarding lives. Surgery ","Spastic cerebral palsy This is the most common type of abnormal muscle tone. Someone with spastic cerebral palsy is likely to experience a tightening of the muscles throughout the body. This tightening can be persistent or intermittent. The amount of stiffness experienced will vary from person to person. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy Individuals with this type of muscle tone may have dystonia or more rarely athetosis. This describes a type of abnormal muscle control where the muscles can shift from tight to floppy without warning, resulting in involuntary movements. Ataxic cerebral palsy This is the least common type of cerebral palsy. It can be identified by shaky movement and poor balance. Someone with ataxic cerebral palsy may struggle with fine motor movements and coordination, like writing or using cutlery. They may have a tremor that increases with activity, and struggle with balance. This can make standing or sitting in an upright position difficult. Mixed cerebral palsy Someone with mixed cerebral palsy may have signs of more than one type of abnormal muscle tone at the same time. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain during pregnancy, birth or early development. There are some things that can increase the risk of a child developing cerebral palsy. These include: premature birth (being born early) neonatal encephalopathy (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain in pregnancy or around the time of birth) stroke or bleeding in the baby’s brain during pregnancy or after birth infection during pregnancy or after birth meningitis head injuries It’s not always possible to tell why a child has developed cerebral palsy.

Diagnosing cerebral palsy ","Read more about mental wellbeing services Most children are diagnosed by two years old. Some children are diagnosed earlier if they’ve spent time in medical settings, for example children who were born premature. To diagnose cerebral palsy, your medical professional will examine your child’s medical history, and how well they can move, balance, and react. They may also use scans like an MRI to see if there’s any sign of damage or abnormal development of the brain. Living with cerebral palsy ","Physiotherapy Targeted physiotherapy can help you or your child improve and maintain posture, coordination, strength and balance. Physiotherapists may recommend specialist mobility equipment and advise about the use of orthotic splints. Occupational therapy Occupational therapists help people who struggle to complete everyday tasks find new ways of completing them. They can show you or your child how to break down activities into smaller movements, helping build confidence. Occupational therapists also have good knowledge of the medical aids and technologies available to help you or your child. Speech and language therapy If you or your child is struggling to talk, a speech and language therapist can help. They have a range of techniques that can help people improve at talking, like helping you or your child learn to shape a sound. Some speech therapists will recommend the use of specialist communication aids. If you or your child is having issues with swallowing, a speech and language therapist can also help by performing an assessment and making recommendations. Orthotics An orthotic device is a piece of equipment that supports a part of the body. This can help improve you or your child’s ability to move and be active. Orthotics can help with a wide range of the physical problems that can be caused by cerebral palsy. Some will only be used for a short period of time, while others may be used throughout you or your child’s entire life. The need for them can also change with time.

Breast cancer (male),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/breast-cancer-male/,About breast cancer in men ,"When to speak to your GP You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge. Why it happens The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: age – most cases affect men over the age of 60 having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) obesity – a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more Read more about The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless. The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple). However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia . This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction) the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration) fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge) bone pain swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit shortness of breath feeling unusually tired all the time feeling sick (nausea) itchy skin with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) When to seek medical advice You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge. These problems are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they should be investigated further. During the examination, they’ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands). It’s likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there’s a possibility you may have breast cancer. Mammogram A mammogram is a type of X-ray used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer. During the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn’t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable. Once your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast. Ultrasound An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts. Biopsy A biopsy may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts. In some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they’re contained within the breast ducts and can’t spread. If left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time. See Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn’t usually cause any side effects. Hormone therapy Up to 90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. ‘E’ is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is ‘estrogen’. This means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women. The aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen is one of the hormone-blocking medications widely used for breast cancer. It’s available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells. a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above a general sense of feeling unwell You should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection. If you’re sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner’s genitals. You should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended Depending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation. Biological therapy Biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer. Biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce. If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning. Trastuzumab Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein. ","Diagnosing breast cancer in men Age Like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It’s rare for young men to develop the condition. Genetics and family history A genetic mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. The result is that one or more of the body’s processes may not work in the way they should. There are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation. There’s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer, such as a mother or sister. Routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn’t usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However, some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around £2,000 to £3,000. Oestrogen There’s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men. Compared with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include: ","During a core biopsy, a local anaesthetic will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump. If cancer is found, it’s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells. This is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found – and they are in more than half of cases – it’s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy. Read Being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment. Feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there’s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared with the support available for women with the condition. Sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be depressed if you’ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy during the past month. ","About breast cancer in men Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. It’s much less common in men than women. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia . This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. Read more about the In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen. Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning. In some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose. Read more about Outlook The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there’s reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose. The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it’s diagnosed. Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread. Read more about diagnosing breast cancer in men . Reducing your risk The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to: drink alcohol in moderation maintain a healthy weight – through a combination of eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly Read more about preventing cancer obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal cirrhosis – this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term alcohol misuse There is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called Klinefelter syndrome . This is a congenital condition that boys are born with that means those who are affected produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual. As testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population. Occupational risks There’s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments. Environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include: blast furnaces steelworks rolling mills – a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers car manufacturing plants One hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels. Another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men. Rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large. The reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn’t yet been proven. Radiation Exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men. Research has found men who received a course of radiotherapy – where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells – directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared with the population at large. However, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low. Diagnosing breast cancer in men for more information. Staging You may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition. Breast Cancer Now is a breast cancer charity that provides an online forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer . Cancer Research UK also provides Cancer Chat , an online forum for anyone affected by cancer. Screening for breast cancer in men As breast cancer is rare in men, routine screening for the condition isn’t recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had radiotherapy . In these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by radiotherapy , hormone therapy, or chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer returning. Surgery An operation called a mastectomy A mastectomy involves removing the entire breast, sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed. In some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there’s a risk the cancer has spread to this area. Once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be. After surgery Most men are well enough to leave hospital 1 to 3 days after surgery. After the operation, it’s likely you’ll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you’re well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this. The wound takes about 2 to 3 weeks to heal. It’s important to keep the wound clean during this time. You should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection. It can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended. Complications of surgery After surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is caused by nerve damage during surgery. The numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent. Another possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called lymphoedema , which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue). If many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system’s ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling. for more information Radiotherapy Radiotherapy A typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes. Radiotherapy isn’t usually painful, although you’ll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells. Common side effects of radiotherapy can include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to sunburn Side effects of tamoxifen can include: reduced interest in sex (loss of libido) inability to obtain or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) headache feeling sick – taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect changes in mood, such as feeling irritable or depressed You should inform your team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available. Aromatase inhibitors Aromatase inhibitors are an alternative type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer. In men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body. Aromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there’s little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer. Side effects of aromatase inhibitors can include: joint pain lack of energy hot flushes skin rashes feeling sick being sick thinning of the hair However, it’s unlikely you’ll experience any or all of these side effects. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+). You may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both. The side effects of chemotherapy can include: feeling sick being sick diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes infertility hair loss On average, for early breast cancer you’ll need to have a session once every 3 weeks, and for more advanced cancer you’ll need to have weekly sessions. Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina , uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it’s not causing any problems. Other side effects of trastuzumab can include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and pains ",

What does a chlamydia test involve? The test for chlamydia is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself. The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are: using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat. ",,,"Antibiotics will treat the chlamydia infection. You should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) have been treated. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom. If chlamydia is left untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners. If chlamydia is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women. If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility. How chlamydia is passed on You can get chlamydia by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Other ways of getting chlamydia include: sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye Chlamydia can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth. Any sexually active person can get chlamydia. It’s most common in people under the age of 30. You can have had chlamydia for a while without knowing. How to prevent chlamydia The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex . This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. Other STIs If you have been diagnosed with chlamydia you should get tested for all STIs including: gonorrhoea syphilis HIV Find your local sexual health clinic ",

Your GP may: carry out a physical examination to check for problems such as swollen glands and a swollen spleen send off a blood sample for testing If your GP thinks you could have CLL, you’ll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests. Blood tests The main test used to help diagnose CLL is a type of blood test called a full blood count. This is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory. Bone marrow biopsy Sometimes the haematologist may recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow (bone marrow biopsy) so they can examine it under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells. The sample is removed using a needle inserted into your hip bone. Local anaesthetic is normally used to numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy. The procedure will last around 15 minutes and you shouldn’t need to stay in hospital overnight. You may have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. Lymph node biopsy Monitoring early-stage CLL This is because: Chemotherapy for more advanced CLL Many people with CLL will eventually need to have chemotherapy. This involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control. diarrhoea or headaches ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date – speak to your GP or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren’t safe if you have a weak immune system avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it’s an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox You may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such as antibiotics to help reduce the risk of infection.

This is called Richter’s transformation or Richter’s syndrome. sudden swelling of your lymph glands a high temperature (fever) night sweats unintentional weight loss tummy (abdominal) pain Richter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines. The Cancer Research UK website has more information on Richter’s syndrome . Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia Around 1 in every 10 people with CLL will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. This is where the immune system starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. It can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired. It’s usually treated with steroid medication Psychological effects ","About chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years. It mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40. Children are almost never affected. In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow) produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that aren’t fully developed and don’t work properly. Over time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness, swollen glands in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising. CLL is different from other types of leukaemia, including chronic myeloid leukaemia , acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia . radiation or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can’t catch it from anyone else or pass it on. However, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing CLL. You may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small. Diagnosing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason. However, you should speak to your GP if you have worrying Risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include: having a family history of the condition being of European, American or Australian origin having certain medical conditions being male Family history In some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. It’s thought that an inherited gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. This means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you’ll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. More research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly increases your chances of also developing the condition. Ethnicity Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of European, American and Australian origin. It’s rare in people from China, Japan and South East Asia, and it affects more white people than black people. It’s not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others. Other medical conditions Research has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These conditions include: pneumonia (chest infection) sinusitis shingles autoimmune haemolytic anaemia long-term (chronic) osteoarthritis prostatitis (an inflamed prostate) However, rather than causing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition. Having a lowered immunity due to having a condition such as HIV or AIDS , or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Radiation exposure Exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but it’s not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . Sex and age For reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. The risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older. ","X-rays and scans You may also have: a chest X-ray an ultrasound of your tummy a computerised tomography (CT) scan The gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or general anaesthetic , where you’re asleep. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight. After the operation, you’ll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches. Genetic tests Tests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells. ","Complications of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . Outlook for CLL The outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it’s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and your general health. Younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when CLL is still in the early stages generally have the best outlook. Some don’t work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells. You may just need to be monitored at first if it’s caught early on. Chemotherapy Stages of CLL Doctors use stages to describe how far CLL has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated. There are 3 main stages of CLL: stage A – you have enlarged lymph glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count stage B – you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count stage C – you have enlarged lymph glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count In these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and blood tests to monitor the condition. These medicines are: Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. Rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight. These include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a steroid medication ). The medicines used to treat CLL can cause some significant side effects, including: persistent tiredness feeling sick an increased risk of infections easy bruising or bleeding anaemia – shortness of breath , weakness and pale skin hair loss or thinning an irregular heartbeat an allergic reaction Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy Stem cell or bone marrow transplants Stem cell or bone marrow transplants are sometimes used to try to get rid of CLL completely, or control it for longer periods. Stem cells are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells. A stem cell transplant involves: having high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells in your body removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of a donor – this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins There’s also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. This is where the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body. These include: radiotherapy to shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen surgery to remove a swollen spleen antibiotics blood transfusions to provide more red blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising immunoglobulin replacement therapy – a transfusion of antibodies taken from donated blood that can help prevent infections injections of medication called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help boost the number of white blood cells complications of CLL that develop. Pain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it. Complications of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can sometimes cause a number of further complications. Infections People with CLL usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells. chemotherapy can also further weaken the immune system. If you have CLL, it’s a good idea to: Having to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious or depressed . Speak to your GP or care team if you’re finding it difficult to cope. You may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or care team will be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area. Macmillan Cancer Support provides an excellent level of help and support.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer. Chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. There is no evidence that it runs in families. tiredness frequent infections unexplained weight loss a feeling of bloating less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless Chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion. severe fatigue bone pain night sweats fever easily bruised skin Philadelphia chromosome Although the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality. Most people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of DNA from one chromosome has been swapped with a section from another. This is called the Philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and grow and multiply far more quickly than usual. Possible triggers for chronic leukaemia Side effects include: nausea vomiting tiredness hair loss infertility high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness Avoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered). While it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour. Also ensure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as: the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccine Psychological effects of chronic leukaemia anxiety and depression . ","Diagnosing chronic myeloid leukaemia Chronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells. They are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like healthy ‘adult’ white blood cells. However, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at Chernobyl. Benzene There is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the UK there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. Benzene is also found in cigarettes. However, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor in acute leukaemia than it is in chronic leukaemia. Occupational risks A number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals. These occupations include: all types of agricultural workers people who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture tailors and dressmakers cleaners builder’s labourer Other risk factors There is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who: are obese have a weakened immune system – due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant have inflammatory bowel disease – such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease Diagnosing chronic myeloid leukaemia Chronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition. A blood test page for information on this) by 18 months, get to a stage where the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission) Chemotherapy is usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage. ","biopsy . A bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic . The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight. The bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. If there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present. Further tests There are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. These can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. Cytogenetic testing an X-ray – usually to examine your chest an ultrasound scan – usually to examine your spleen and liver Imatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase (tyrosine kinase helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). This reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells. Imatinib is taken as a tablet. The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. They include: nausea vomiting swelling in the face and lower legs muscle cramps rash diarrhoea Nilotinib ","Complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia About chronic myeloid leukaemia Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are 2 main types: lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage These pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia acute lymphoblastic leukaemia What happens in chronic leukaemia Your bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell: red blood cells – which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells – which help fight infection platelets – which help stop bleeding Bone marrow biopsy For example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome. People who have this chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Imaging tests Imatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. These tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them. by 3 months, correct the blood count by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome (see Imatinib Nilotinib works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Side effects of nilotinib can include: vomiting abdominal pain bone and joint pain dry skin loss of appetite hair loss insomnia night sweats dizziness tingling or numbness Read about the complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia for more information and advice about being vulnerable to infection and bleeding. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. Side effects include: tiredness skin rash increased vulnerability to infection Chemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. This is known as being immunocompromised. Read chronic leukaemia complications for more information about this. Bone marrow and stem cell transplants A bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary for some patients. Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body. This can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type. Due to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation. In most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit. Read more about bone marrow transplants Complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia Being immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia. There are 2 reasons for this: the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia can weaken the immune system This means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications. You may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups. Another excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support . Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and is open Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm.

Chickenpox,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/chickenpox/,Chickenpox is a mild and common illness that mostly affects children but can be caught at any age. ,"feeling sick a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over aching, painful muscles headache generally feeling unwell loss of appetite Contacting your doctor about chickenpox For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own. Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. Adults have a higher risk of developing complications. Contact your GP practice if: the skin around the blisters becomes hot, red and painful, (redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin) pain in the chest or difficulty breathing signs of dehydration , such as fewer wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet blisters on their skin become infected or you are pregnant or have given birth in the last 7 days you have a weakened immune system (the body’s defence system) your baby is less than 4 weeks old you are breastfeeding If your GP is closed, phone 111. Contact your GP practice if: you’re not sure if you or your child has chickenpox you’re worried about your child Tell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a GP practice. paracetamol to help bring down a fever calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching. In most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within 1 to 2 weeks. Adults with chickenpox may be helped by taking antiviral medicine if its diagnosed early enough. Stopping the spread of chickenpox You should keep children off school or nursery until all their spots have crusted over. This will help stop chickenpox being spread. Adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over. Chickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts. It stops being infectious when all the blisters have crusted over. This happens usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash. If you or your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas. This will help them avoid contact with people who may not have had it. You should especially stay away from people who are at risk of serious problems, such as: newborn babies pregnant women They may need a blood test to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox. Chickenpox in pregnancy If you’re pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications. Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies. Your risk of developing pneumonia is slightly higher if you’re pregnant, especially if you smoke. The further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be. If you get chickenpox while you’re pregnant, there is also a small but significant risk to your unborn baby. If you get chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (FVS). This syndrome is rare. FVS can cause serious complications, including: scarring eye defects, such as cataracts shortened limbs brain damage There are also other risks from catching chickenpox after week 20 of pregnancy. It’s possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy). If you are infected with chickenpox 7 days before or 7 days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. In a few severe cases, this type of chickenpox can be fatal. Chickenpox and shingles Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again. ","Chickenpox (known medically as varicella) is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It’s spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected. Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. Children usually catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May. blisters . They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off. Chickenpox spots The spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be: behind the ears on the face over the scalp on the chest and belly on the arms and legs But, the spots can be anywhere on the body, including: inside the ears and mouth on the palms of the hands soles of the feet inside the nappy area. The rash starts as small, itchy red spots. These develop a blister on top and become very itchy after about 12 to 14 hours. After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over. After 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally. New spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out. Before chickenpox spots appear Before the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild flu It’s possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around. Read more about shingles . Is there a vaccine against chickenpox? There is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. Only children and adults who are more vulnerable to the complications of chickenpox will get offered the vaccine. It may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. There is also a chance that someone who has had the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming into close contact with a person who has shingles. ",,Who’s at higher risk from chickenpox? Some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include: pregnant women newborn babies people with a weakened immune system ,
Chest infection,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/chest-infection/,"Chest infections are common, especially after a cold or flu during autumn and winter. Although most are mild and get better on their own, some can be serious or even life-threatening. ","a persistent cough coughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood breathlessness or rapid and shallow breathing wheezing a high temperature (fever) a rapid heartbeat chest pain or tightness feeling confused and disorientated headache , fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, or joint and muscle pain. Do get plenty of rest drink lots of fluid to prevent dehydration and to loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up treat headaches, fever and aches and pains with pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen drink a warm drink of honey and lemon to relieve a sore throat caused by persistent coughing raise your head up with extra pillows while you’re sleeping to make breathing easier stop smoking if you smoke Avoid cough medicines, as there’s little evidence they work. Coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs. Antibiotics aren’t recommended for many chest infections, because they only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus. Your GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you’re at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs ( pleurisy ). If there’s a flu outbreak in your local area and you’re at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication. Read more about you feel confused, disorientated or drowsy you have chest pain or difficulty breathing you cough up blood or blood-stained phlegm your skin or lips develop a blue tinge (cyanosis) you’re pregnant you’re 65 or over you’re very overweight and have difficulty breathing you think a child under five has a chest infection you have a weakened immune system you have a long-term health condition you have a cough that has lasted more than 3 weeks In some cases, further tests – such as a chest X-ray , breathing tests and testing phlegm or blood samples – may be needed. Preventing chest infections There are measures you can take to help reduce your risk of developing chest infections and stop them spreading to others. Stop smoking If you smoke, one of the best things you can do to prevent a chest infection is to stop. Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection. Read more information and advice about stopping smoking Good hygiene Although chest infections generally aren’t as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing. Therefore, it’s important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash your hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately. Alcohol and diet Excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse can weaken your lungs’ natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections. To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends: not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it’s best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days if you’re trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it’s a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections. Read more about healthy eating and tips on cutting down on alcohol Vaccinations If you’re at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia). These vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future. Flu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for: babies and young children pregnant women (flu jab only) people aged 65 and over people with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems ","A chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are bronchitis and pneumonia . Most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria. These infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others. The infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose. Certain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as: babies and very young children children with developmental problems people who are very overweight elderly people pregnant women people who smoke people with long-term health conditions, such as asthma , heart disease , diabetes , kidney disease , cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) people with a weakened immune system – this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids, chemotherapy or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed HIV infection Read more about the and the ",,and When to contact your GP practice Contact your GP practice if: ,
Chilblains,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/chilblains/,"Chilblains are small, itchy swellings on the skin that occur as a reaction to cold temperatures. They most often affect the body’s extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose. Chilblains can be uncomfortable, but rarely cause any permanent damage. They normally heal within a few weeks if further exposure to the cold is avoided. Chilblains can turn the skin red and may cause a burning or stinging sensation. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ In severe cases, chilblains can cause the skin to blister. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ ","Chilblains usually develop several hours after exposure to the cold. They typically cause a burning and itching sensation in the affected areas, which can become more intense if you go into a warm room. The affected skin may also swell and turn red or dark blue. In severe cases, the surface of the skin may break and sores or blisters can develop. It’s important not to scratch the skin as it can break easily and become infected. When to seek medical advice for chilblains Most people don’t need to seek medical advice if they have chilblains as they usually heal within a few weeks and don’t cause any permanent problems. Speak to your GP or chiropodist if you have: severe or recurring chilblains chilblains that don’t improve within a few weeks You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may have become infected. Signs of infection include: swelling and pus forming in the affected area feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above swollen glands ","Chilblains are the result of an abnormal reaction to the cold. They’re common in the UK because damp, cold weather is usual in the winter. Some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter. When the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider. If this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow. This can cause blood to leak into the surrounding tissue, which may cause the swelling and itchiness associated with chilblains. Who’s more at risk of chilblains? Some people are more at risk of chilblains than others. This includes people with: poor circulation a family history of chilblains regular exposure to cold, damp or draughty conditions a poor diet or low body weight lupus Raynaud’s phenomenon – a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toes People who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels. Chilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure, such as a bunion or a toe that’s squeezed by tight shoes. Do keep active – this helps improve your circulation wear warm clothes and insulate your hands, feet and legs – wearing long johns, long boots, tights, leg warmers or long socks will help, and it’s a good idea to wear a clean pair of socks if you get cold feet in bed avoid tight shoes and boots – these can restrict the circulation to your toes and feet moisturise your feet regularly – this stops them drying out and the skin cracking eat at least one hot meal during the day – this’ll help warm your whole body, particularly in cold weather warm your shoes on the radiator before you put them on – make sure damp shoes are dry before you wear them; if your feet are already cold, make sure your shoes aren’t too hot to avoid causing chilblains warm your hands before going outdoors – soak them in warm water for several minutes and dry thoroughly, and wear cotton-lined waterproof gloves if necessary; if your hands are already cold, make sure not to warm them up too quickly to avoid causing chilblains keep your house well heated – try to keep one room in the house warm and avoid drafts if you’re diabetic, regularly check your feet (or ask someone else to do this) – people with diabetes may not be able to feel their feet and could have infected chilblains without realising it Complications of chilblains If you have severe or recurring chilblains, there’s a small risk of further problems developing, such as: infection from blistered or scratched skin ulcers forming on the skin permanent discolouration of the skin scarring of the skin Avoiding complications of chilblains It’s often possible to avoid complications of chilblains. Don’t do not scratch or rub the affected areas of skin do not directly overheat the chilblains (by using hot water, for example) You can also help reduce your risk of infection by cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic and covering the area with an antiseptic dressing. The dressing should be changed every other day until the skin heals. If the skin does become infected, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection. ",,"It may help to use a soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, to relieve itching. Your pharmacist may also be able to recommend a suitable product. If your chilblains are severe and keep returning, speak to your GP. They may recommend taking a daily tablet or capsule of a medication called nifedipine. This works by relaxing the blood vessels, improving your circulation. Nifedipine can be used to help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken during the winter to stop them developing. Preventing chilblains If you’re susceptible to chilblains, you can reduce your risk of developing them by: limiting your exposure to the cold looking after your feet taking steps to improve your circulation ",
Cervical cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/cervical-cancer/,About cervical cancer ,"periods or after the menopause . Abnormal bleeding doesn’t mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within 2 weeks. Read more about the and diagnosing cervical cancer Screening for cervical cancer Cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years. You may be recalled more often depending on your test results. Those on non-routine screening (where screening results have shown changes that need further investigation or follow up) will be invited up to 70 years of age. You will be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment. Read more about cervical screening However, it’s important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who have them don’t develop cervical cancer. Using condoms during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can’t always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area. Since 2008, a HPV vaccine has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13. Read more about the This is why it’s very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments. Unusual bleeding In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex. Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the menopause (when a woman’s monthly periods stop). Visit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding. Advanced cervical cancer constipation blood in your urine (haematuria) loss of bladder control ( urinary incontinence ) bone pain swelling of one of your legs severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a condition called hydronephrosis changes to your bladder and bowel habits loss of appetite weight loss tiredness and a lack of energy When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you experience: bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding) bleeding outside of your normal periods new bleeding after the menopause genital warts , although these types aren’t linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer. About 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The 2 types known to have the highest risk are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers. High-risk types of HPV are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. This material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour. See preventing cervical cancer for more information about reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN). CIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions don’t pose an immediate threat to a person’s health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future. However, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during cervical screening colposcopy . This is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix. During a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. As well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample ( biopsy ) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. Cone biopsy In some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. The operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a local anaesthetic . During a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. You may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. You may also have period-like pains. Further testing If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there’s a risk that the cancer may have spread, you’ll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. These tests may include: a pelvic examination carried out under general anaesthetic – your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer blood tests – these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow computerised tomography (CT) scan – scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the CT scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread chest X-ray – this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs positive emission tomography (PET) scan palliative care . Removing abnormal cells Chemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you’ll be able to go home once you’ve received your dose. As with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. Side effects are therefore common and can include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea feeling tired all the time reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells mouth ulcers loss of appetite hair loss – your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss Some types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular blood tests to assess the health of your kidneys. Follow-up you no longer have monthly periods or your periods become much more irregular hot flushes vaginal dryness loss of sex drive mood changes stress incontinence (leaking urine when you cough or sneeze) night sweats thinning of the bones, which can lead to brittle bones ( osteoporosis ) hormone replacement therapy (HRT) . Narrowing of the vagina Radiotherapy to treat cervical cancer can often cause your vagina to become narrower, which can make having sex painful or difficult. tiredness swollen ankles, feet or hands, caused by water retention shortness of breath feeling sick blood in your urine (haematuria) pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot redness of the skin, particularly at the back of your leg, below the knee A major concern in these cases is that the blood clot from the leg vein will travel up to the lungs and block the supply of blood. This is known as a pulmonary embolism and can be fatal. Blood clots in the legs are usually treated using a combination of blood-thinning medication, such as heparin or warfarin , and compression garments designed to help encourage the flow of blood through the limbs. Read more about palliative care . Palliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers. There are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. You may want to think about whether you’d like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and discuss these issues with your doctor. Some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include: Macmillan Cancer Support – which has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. To be referred to a Macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or GP, or call 0808 808 00 00. Marie Curie Cancer Care – have specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. They also run hospices for people with cancer. Hospice UK – provides information about hospice care and how to find a hospice. Living with cervical cancer Cervical cancer vaccination The NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called Gardasil. Gardasil protects against four types of HPV, including the 2 strains responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK (HPV16 and HPV 18). It also prevents genital warts . Girls are offered the childhood immunisation programme . The vaccine is given to girls when they’re 12 to 13 years old, with 3 doses given over a 6-month period. Although the HPV vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it doesn’t guarantee that you won’t develop the condition. You should still attend cervical screening tests, even if you’ve had the vaccine. Avoid smoking You can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. People who smoke are less able to get rid of the HPV infection from the body, which can develop into cancer. If you decide to give up smoking, you could contact the Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84. Quit Your Way Scotland is run by NHS 24 and is staffed by trained advisors who’ll be able to give you expert advice. For more information and advice on giving up smoking, see stopping smoking and ","Diagnosing cervical cancer Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) . HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman. There are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer. and preventing cervical cancer In almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell DNA caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Cancer begins with a change in the structure of the DNA that’s present in all human cells. DNA provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce. A change in the DNA’s structure is known as a mutation. It can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. If the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour. Human papilloma virus (HPV) More than 99% of cervical cancer cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types. HPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an HPV infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5 women will develop the infection at some point in their lives. ","This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression . Typical signs of depression include feeling sad, hopeless and losing interest in things you used to enjoy. ","Complications of cervical cancer Living with cervical cancer Preventing cervical cancer About cervical cancer Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman’s cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina). If cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it’s usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it’s possible to leave the womb in place, but it may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is called a hysterectomy . Radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it’s used alongside surgery. More advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy . early menopause and infertility . Read more about Complications Complications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure. Read more about the complications of cervical cancer Outlook The stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining outlook. The staging, given as a number from 1 to 4, indicates how far the cancer has spread. The chances of living for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are: stage 1 – 80-99% stage 2 – 60-90% stage 3 – 30-50% stage 4 – 20% Read more about the staging of cervical cancer Who’s affected by cervical cancer? Following the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year. It’s possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25. The progression from becoming infected with HPV to developing CIN or CGIN and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often taking 10 to 20 years. Read more about cervical screening results Increased risk The fact that HPV infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. There appear to be additional risk factors that affect a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer. These include: smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer than women who don’t; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix having a weakened immune system – this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as HIV or AIDS taking the oral contraceptive pill for more than 5 years – women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don’t, although it’s not clear why having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) – women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared with women who don’t have any children The reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of HPV. The spread of cervical cancer If cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix and into the surrounding tissue and organs. The cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. Alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters). The cancer can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. Cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system. The lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). If you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen. In some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected. Diagnosing cervical cancer Referral will be recommended if the results of your cervical screening test suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. However, in most cases, the abnormalities don’t mean you have cervical cancer. You may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, or if your GP has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination. The sexually transmitted infection (STI) chlamydia is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. Your GP may recommend that you’re tested for it first before being referred. Testing for chlamydia involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test. Colposcopy Staging After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. The higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. The staging for cervical cancer is as follows: stage 0 (pre-cancer) – there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS) stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the cervix stage 2 – the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn’t reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as the lungs early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb, radiotherapy , or a combination advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy , although surgery is also sometimes used The prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread. large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) – the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current cone biopsy – the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery laser therapy – a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells Read more about Surgery There are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. They are: radical trachelectomy – the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place hysterectomy – the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes pelvic exenteration – a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed Radical trachelectomy A radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a very early stage. It’s usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential. During the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts) in your abdomen. Specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. Lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. Your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina. Compared with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration, the advantage of this type of surgery is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may still be able to have children. However, it’s important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can’t guarantee you’ll still be able to have children. If you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by caesarean section. It’s also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal. Radical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. It’s only available at a number of specialist centres in the UK, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated. Hysterectomy A hysterectomy is usually recommended for early cervical cancer. This may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back. There are 2 types of hysterectomies used to treat cervical cancer: simple hysterectomy – where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers radical hysterectomy – where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage 1 and some early stage 2 cervical cancers Short-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder or rectum. The risk of long-term complications is small, but they can be troublesome. They include: the risk that your vagina can become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful urinary incontinence swelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid ( lymphoedema ) your bowel becomes obstructed because of a build-up of scar tissue – this may require further surgery to correct As your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you’ll no longer be able to have children. If your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger the menopause if you haven’t already experienced it. See complications of cervical cancer for more information about the menopause. Pelvic exenteration the cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel 2 holes called stomas are created in your abdomen – the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bags Following a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. This means you’ll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy may be used on its own or combined with surgery for early-stage cervical cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain. There are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. These are: externally – a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells internally – a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix In most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. A course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks. However, the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. For some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer. Side effects of radiotherapy are common and can include: diarrhoea pain when urinating bleeding from your vagina or rectum feeling very tired (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore skin in your pelvis region similar to sunburn narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful infertility damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven’t already experienced it) bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence If infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. However, you may have to pay for this. It may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. This is known as an ovarian transposition. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy As there’s a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. If anything suspicious is found, a further biopsy can be carried out. Complications of cervical cancer Side effects Early menopause radiotherapy , it will trigger an early menopause (if you haven’t already had it). Most women experience the menopause in their early fifties. The second is to use a vaginal dilator, which is a tampon-shaped device made of plastic. You insert it into your vagina and is designed to help make it more supple. It’s usually recommended that you insert the dilator for 5 to 10 minutes at a time on a regular basis during the day over the course of 6 to 12 months. You may find that the more times you have sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about sexuality and cancer Lymphoedema If the lymph nodes in your pelvis are removed, it can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of your lymphatic system. One of the functions of the lymphatic system is to drain away excess fluid from the body’s tissue. A disruption to this process can lead to a build-up of fluid in the tissue known as lymphoedema . This can cause certain body parts to become swollen – usually the legs, in cases of cervical cancer. There are exercises and massage techniques that can reduce the swelling. Wearing specially designed bandages and compression garments can also help. Read more about Emotional impact The emotional impact of living with cervical cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a ‘rollercoaster’ effect. antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). You may also find Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust a useful resource. It’s the UK’s only charity dedicated to women affected by cervical cancer. Local cancer support groups may also be available in your area for women affected by cancer. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide contact details. Read more about feelings and cancer Advanced cervical cancer Some of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below. Pain If the cancer spreads into your nerve endings, bones or muscles, it can often cause severe pain. A number of effective painkilling medications can usually be used to control the pain. Depending on the levels of pain, they can range from paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen , to more powerful opiate-based painkillers, such as codeine and morphine. Tell your care team if the painkillers you’re prescribed aren’t effective in reducing your pain. You may need to be prescribed a stronger medication. A short course of radiotherapy may also be effective in controlling the pain. Macmillan nurses , who work both in hospitals and in the community, can also provide expert advice about pain relief. Kidney failure Your kidneys remove waste material from your blood. The waste is passed out of your body in urine through tubes called the ureters. Kidney function can be monitored by a simple blood test called serum creatinine level. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, the cancerous tumour can press against the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. The build-up of urine inside the kidneys is known as hydronephrosis and can cause the kidneys to become swollen and stretched. Severe cases of hydronephrosis can cause the kidneys to become scarred, which can lead to the loss of most or all of the kidneys’ functions. This is known as kidney failure. Blood clots As with other types of cancer, cervical cancer can make the blood ‘stickier’ and more prone to forming clots. Bed rest after surgery and chemotherapy can also increase the risk of developing a clot. Large tumours can press on the veins in the pelvis, which slows the flow of blood and can lead to a blood clot developing in the legs. Bleeding If the cancer spreads into your vagina, bowel or bladder, it can cause significant damage, resulting in bleeding. Bleeding can occur in your vagina or rectum (back passage), or you may pass blood when you urinate. Minor bleeding can often be treated using a medication called tranexamic acid, which encourages the blood to clot and stop the bleeding. Radiotherapy can also be highly effective in controlling bleeding caused by cancer. Major bleeding may be treated temporarily by vaginal packing (using gauze to stem the bleeding) and later by surgery, radiotherapy or by cutting off blood supply to the cervix. Fistula A fistula is an uncommon but distressing complication that occurs in around 1 in 50 cases of advanced cervical cancer. A fistula is an abnormal channel that develops between 2 sections of the body. In most cases involving cervical cancer, the fistula develops between the bladder and the vagina. This can lead to a persistent discharge of fluid from the vagina. A fistula can sometimes develop between the vagina and rectum. Surgery is usually required to repair a fistula, although it’s often not possible in women with advanced cervical cancer, because they’re usually too frail to withstand the effects of surgery. Vaginal discharge Another uncommon, but distressing, complication of advanced cervical cancer is an unpleasant-smelling discharge from your vagina. The discharge can occur for a number of reasons, such as the breakdown of tissue, the leakage of bladder or bowel contents out of the vagina, or a bacterial infection of the vagina. Palliative care Many women with cervical cancer have a radical hysterectomy . This is a major operation that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. During this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as lifting children or heavy shopping bags. You won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. Most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy. chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact. Work If you have cancer, you’re covered by the Disability Discrimination Act . This means that your employer isn’t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. Examples of these include: allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment The definition of what’s ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer’s business, for example. You should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you’ll need off and when. Speak to a member of your human resources department, if you have one. Your union or staff association representative can also give you advice. If you’re having difficulties with your employer, your union or local Citizens Advice Bureau may be able to help. Macmillan Cancer Support also has more information and advice about work and cancer . Money and benefits If you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example: if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income It’s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need. Your sex life If you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. This will give your body time to heal. If you’re having chemotherapy, male partners should wear a condom when you have sex, because it’s not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them. See complications of cervical cancer for more information Preventing cervical cancer There’s no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk. Safer sex Most cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) . HPV can be spread through unprotected sex, so using a condom can reduce your risk of developing the infection. However, the virus isn’t just passed on through penetrative sex – it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys. Your risk of developing an HPV infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it. Read more about sexual health Cervical screening Regular cervical screening is the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage. Cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland between the ages of 25 and 64 every 5 years. You may be recalled more often depending on your test results. Make sure that your GP surgery has your up-to-date contact details, so that you continue getting screening invitations. It’s important that you attend your cervical screening tests, even if you’ve been vaccinated for HPV, because the vaccine doesn’t guarantee protection against cervical cancer. . ",

If you’re at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have: high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes a family history of CKD Read more about diagnosing chronic kidney disease Why does it happen? The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They’re located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also: help maintain blood pressure maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help heart and muscles function properly produce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells Chronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure. Read more about the In other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant. weight loss and poor appetite swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) shortness of breath blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test) an increased need to urinate, particularly at night insomnia itchy skin muscle cramps high blood pressure (hypertension) nausea erectile dysfunction in men (an inability to get or maintain an erection) Stage 5 (G5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an eGFR of below 15), which is known as established renal failure. Further testing should be carried out every 3 months. If you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. You may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before. If you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. Your GP or dietitian can advise you about this. The excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. You may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body. If you do not have any fluid retention and you have not been told to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so. In fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.

Kidney disease services should: identify people at risk of kidney disease, especially people with high blood pressure or diabetes, and treat them as early as possible to maintain their kidney function ","Who is affected? CKD is common and mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease. It’s estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD. CKD is more common in people of south Asian origin (those from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and black people than the general population. The reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south Asian people and higher rates of high blood pressure in African or Caribbean people. Kidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. High blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes High blood pressure Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. Too much pressure can damage your body’s organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function. The cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown. There appears to be a link between the condition and a person’s general health, diet, and lifestyle. Known risk factors for high blood pressure include: age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older) family history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families) being of African-Caribbean or south Asian origin obesity lack of exercise smoking excessive alcohol consumption high amount of salt in your diet high-fat diet stress Diabetes Diabetes is a condition in which the body produces no – or too little – insulin ( type 1 diabetes ) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin ( type 2 diabetes ). Insulin is needed to regulate levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals. If diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. The glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids. It is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. Around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage. The first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. Therefore, your GP will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible. All people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. Early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence. There are many other conditions that less commonly cause CKD, including: glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney) pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney) polycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts) failure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb systemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue) long-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , including aspirin and ibuprofen blockages, for example due to kidney stones or prostate disease Statins sometimes have mild side effects, including: constipation diarrhoea headaches abdominal pain Most people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. To boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions. If this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. These injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously). Examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. Correction of phosphate balance If you have stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. Phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. Phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. The kidneys usually filter out excess phosphate. If phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. This can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries. You may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. Foods high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. Your GP or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. However, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level. Always ask a healthcare professional before changing your diet. If reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. These medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body. To work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. The most commonly used phosphate binder is calcium carbonate, but there are also alternatives that may be more suitable for you. The side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include: nausea stomach ache constipation diarrhoea flatulence (wind) skin rash itchy skin Vitamin D supplements People with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones. This is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin D from food and the sun before it can be used by the body. ","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests. Screening If you are in a high-risk group for developing CKD, it is important to be regularly screened for the condition. People who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for CKD. Annual screening is recommended for the following groups: people with high blood pressure (hypertension) people with diabetes people with acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate people with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or heart failure ) people with a family history of stage 5 CKD (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease people with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause Your GP can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for CKD. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) An effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min. It is difficult to measure the GFR directly, so it is estimated using a formula. The result is called the estimated GFR or eGFR. Calculating your eGFR involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. The result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. For example, an eGFR of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function. The following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine) urine tests – used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine albumin and creatinine testing – this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine, and the ratio of the 2 (the albumin:creatinine ratio or ACR) can be used with eGFR to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning Staging A 6-stage system, based on eGFR levels, is used to describe the progression of CKD. The higher the stage, the more severe the CKD. Stage 1 (sometimes called G1): the eGFR is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage. Stage 2 (G2): the eGFR has decreased slightly (60 to 89), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult. If you have stage 1 or 2 CKD, it is recommended you have annual eGFR tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored. Stage 3 is divided into 2: stage 3a (G3a) and 3b (G3b). In stage 3a, the eGFR has decreased mildly (45 to 59) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. In stage 3b (G3b) it has decreased moderately (30 to 44) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every 6 months. Other tests Other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys: kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan, are used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow – in cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist. People on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. Loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems. ","Preventing chronic kidney disease Living with chronic kidney disease About chronic kidney disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively. People with CKD are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation. In a minority of people, CKD may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF) or end-stage kidney disease. In this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working. dialysis , or a kidney transplant. Read more about Living kidney donation A kidney transplant from a living donor can be planned to avoid or reduce the time someone is on dialysis. This can offer a better long term outcome for the person receiving the organ. There are 2 types of living kidney donation: directed donation – a person can donate a kidney to someone they know, like a family member or a friend altruistic kidney donation – a person can donate a kidney anonymously to someone they do not know Further information about living donation. Living with chronic kidney disease Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope. Read more about living with chronic kidney disease Preventing chronic kidney disease The main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed. Some lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of CKD developing, these include: having a healthy diet avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol exercising regularly avoiding medicines that can damage the kidney Read more about preventing chronic kidney disease Lifestyle changes The following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD: stopping smoking eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day not using over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional moderating your alcohol intake so it is within recommended limits losing weight if you are overweight or obese doing regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week Read more about preventing high blood pressure through lifestyle changes. Medications for high blood pressure One of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to manage high blood pressure . Good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys. People with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg. There are many types of blood pressure drugs. Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD. As well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels, ACE inhibitors give additional protection to the kidney. ACE inhibitors include: ramipril enalapril lisinopril perindopril Side effects of ACE inhibitors include: a persistent, dry cough dizziness tiredness or weakness headaches Most of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough. If the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB). This group of medicines includes: candesartan eprosartan irbesartan azilsartan olmesartan temisartan valsartan losartan The side effects of ARBs are uncommon, but can include dizziness. Medication to reduce cholesterol Studies have shown that people with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. This is because some of the risk factors for CKD are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis). In a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys stop working and it becomes life threatening. This is called kidney failure or established renal failure (ERF). Read more about dialysis and kidney transplants. This is also called palliative care. are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious physical illness, especially severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life Doctors and nurses will make sure you receive: medicines to protect your remaining kidney function for as long as possible give people good-quality information about managing their condition provide access to a specialist renal (kidney) team give people access to transplant or dialysis services if required provide supportive care It may be helpful for you to make a care plan because this can help you manage your day-to-day health. Your kidney disease specialist nurse may be able to help with this. Preventing chronic kidney disease In most cases, chronic kidney disease (CKD) cannot be completely prevented, although you can take steps to reduce the chances of the condition developing. Managing your condition If you have a chronic (long-term) condition, such as diabetes, that could potentially cause chronic kidney disease, it is important it is carefully managed. Follow the advice of your GP and keep all appointments relating to your condition. People with diabetes are advised to have their kidney function tested every year. Read more about Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes Smoking Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks or strokes, and it can increase the likelihood that any existing kidney problems will get worse. If you stop smoking, you will improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer and heart disease. The NHS smoking helpline can offer you advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking. Phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84. Read more about stopping smoking Diet A healthy diet is important for preventing chronic kidney disease. It will lower the amount of cholesterol in your blood and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables ( 5 a day ) and whole grains. Limit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure. One teaspoonful of salt is equal to about 6g. Avoid eating foods high in saturated fat because this will increase your cholesterol level. Foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking) lard cream hard cheese cakes and biscuits foods that contain coconut oil or palm oil Eating some foods that are high in unsaturated fat can help decrease your cholesterol level. Foods high in unsaturated fat include: oily fish avocados nuts and seeds sunflower oil rapeseed oil olive oil Read more about healthy food and diet Alcohol Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol will cause your blood pressure to rise, as well as raising cholesterol levels in your blood. Therefore, sticking to the recommended alcohol consumption limits is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and CKD. Exercise Regular exercise should help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing CKD. At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, is recommended. Read more about health and fitness Painkillers Kidney disease can be caused by the improper use (such as taking too many) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) , such as aspirin and ibuprofen . If you need to take painkillers, make sure you follow the instructions. This can help to avoid kidney damage. Living with chronic kidney disease Relationships and support Coming to terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they are close to you. Be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. However, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need. Get support Your GP or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP practice will have information on these. Some people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or online. Money and finances If you have to stop work or work part time because of your kidney disease, you may find it hard to cope financially. You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support: if you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance if you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for Disability Living Allowance if you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance if you are caring for someone with kidney disease, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income Sex and pregnancy Pregnancy Both men and women with early stage kidney disease will find their fertility is unaffected. This means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby. Later stage kidney disease may affect women’s periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. For men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. However, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so both men and women need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby. Women who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease. Depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. Your healthcare team can advise you about this. Holidays and insurance If you have mild kidney disease or you’ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn’t pose additional health problems, whether you’re staying in the UK or going abroad. If you’re on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. It can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the UK than it is abroad. The NHS will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the UK. If you’re in Europe, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) It’s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the EHIC. Anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. It may exclude you from some policies. Using over-the-counter medicines Some remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. Make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine. You’re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if: you have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal) you have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart disease What’s safe and what’s not Summarised below is a list of which over the counter remedies are safe for people with kidney disease to use and which should be avoided. This is just a guide. For more detailed information, consult your pharmacist, renal specialist or GP. Headaches Paracetamol is safe and the best choice of painkiller to treat a headache, but avoid soluble products as they are high in sodium. If your kidney function is less than about 50%, avoid painkillers containing aspirin, ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac. These products can deteriorate the function of damaged kidneys. Low-dose aspirin Coughs and colds Many of the products available for coughs and colds contain a mixture of ingredients, so check the packaging carefully. Some products contain paracetamol, which is safe, but others contain high doses of aspirin, which it’s best to avoid. Many cold remedies also contain decongestants , which you should avoid if you have high blood pressure. The best way to clear congestion is by steam inhalation with menthol or eucalyptus. For coughs, try a simple linctus or glycerine honey and lemon to soothe your throat. Muscle and joint pains If you have muscle or joint pain, it’s ideal to use topical preparations (applied to the skin), which are rubbed on to the painful area. Avoid tablets containing ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac if your kidney function is below 50%. Ibuprofen gel or spray is safer than ibuprofen tablets, but it isn’t completely risk-free as a small amount of the drug penetrates the skin into the bloodstream. Kidney failure About 1% of people with stage three CKD develop kidney failure, also called established renal failure (ERF). Kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. People diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition. Choices if you have established renal failure dialysis Many people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. Supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life. Transplant Over a third of kidney transplants are now from live donors. A live donor kidney can be transplanted before the need for dialysis, rather than after a period of time on dialysis. One major risk after transplantation is rejection, where the immune system attacks the donated kidney because it mistakes it for a foreign object. This is prevented with the use of strong drugs to suppress the immune system. These drugs need to be taken meticulously. They are usually well tolerated but may have side effects, including an increased susceptibility to infections and some forms of cancer. For this reason, transplant patients are given regular reviews in a specialist transplant clinic. Dialysis Dialysis can take place at home or in hospital. It involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. It is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. They also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). There are 2 types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis Haemodialysis Home haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. You’ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. Some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. Most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted. Quality vascular access During haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. This requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. For this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). This is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least 6 weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used. Occasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. In this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. A catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid. All the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made. ",
Cold sore,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/cold-sore/,About cold sores ,"Cold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip. Read more about the . When to get professional advice An outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection). Herpes simplex virus primary infection In children swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth – this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis sore throat and swollen glands producing more saliva than normal high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above dehydration feeling sick (nausea) headaches Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to 3 weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn’t usually recur after the primary infection. In adults You’ll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into ulcers with grey or yellow centres. Recurrent infections (cold sores) Recurrent infections usually last for less time and are less severe than the primary infection. The only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands. An outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip. If you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. They may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. Initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation. If you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes: drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration avoid acidic or salty foods and eat cool, soft foods if brushing your teeth is painful, use an antiseptic mouthwash dab creams on to sores rather than rubbing them in wash your hands using soap and water before and after applying cold sore creams avoid touching your cold sores, other than to apply cream, and don’t share your cold sore cream with others Antiviral creams and tablets Antiviral creams such as aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as Fenistil ® ) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection if used correctly. Cold sore creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. They’re only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect. If you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores, use antiviral medication as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that indicates a cold sore is about to develop. You’ll need to apply the cream up to 5 times a day for 4 to 5 days. Antiviral creams can only help to heal a current outbreak of cold sores. They don’t get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring. For example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – a secondary eye infection – you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor. Gingivostomatitis If the infection is painful, your pharmacist may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat. Brushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. Your pharmacist may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. This helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can’t brush your teeth effectively. Specialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you’re pregnant or have a weakened immune system. ","The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1. In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be the result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes . Read more about the . Herpes simplex virus The herpes simplex virus – or ‘cold sore virus’ – is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time. However, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight, fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period. Some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active. Left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness. It’s therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes – for example, to remove contact lenses – wash your hands thoroughly first. In very rare cases, encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as aciclovir. Preventing infection It’s not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection. Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they’re completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared. However, there’s no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore. You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below: avoid touching cold sores unless you’re applying cold sore cream – creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in, as this can damage your skin further always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area do not share cold sore creams or medication with other people as this can cause the infection to spread do not share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with HIV or those having chemotherapy if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers – for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight Cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood – for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore. The virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it’s triggered at a later date. Cold sore triggers Factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include: having another infection, such as a respiratory tract infection having a high temperature (fever) emotional upset or psychological stress tiredness and fatigue an injury to the affected area menstruation (periods) strong sunlight However, in many cases there’s no obvious trigger for an outbreak. Herpes simplex virus type 2 Occasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who has genital herpes , which is usually caused by HSV-2. In genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area. ",,"About cold sores Search for a pharmacy near you Cold sores aren’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required. If you’ve had outbreaks of cold sores before, it’s likely that you’ll know what they are if they return. You only need to visit your pharmacist if you’re unsure whether it’s a cold sore or if it’s severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your pharmacist if a cold sore hasn’t healed after 7 to 10 days. Antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases. Read more about . Complications of cold sores Dehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated. The herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include: skin infections – these often occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a cut or graze , or a skin condition such as eczema Cold sore patches Several non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter from pharmacies without the need for a prescription. Pain can also be treated with painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol – both are available in liquid form for young children. However, don’t take ibuprofen if you have asthma or stomach ulcers , or you’ve had them in the past. Children under the age of 16 shouldn’t be given aspirin. Speak to your pharmacist if you have cold sores and you’re pregnant. If your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged – for example, if you have HIV or you’re having chemotherapy For example, your risk of developing encephalitis or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased. In rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it’s possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. Using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this. Dehydration If you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Young children are particularly at risk as they may refuse to eat or drink because of the pain in their mouth. It’s important to watch out for signs of dehydration , such as: headaches tiredness irritability lightheadedness low urine output Most cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to 3 weeks for the sores to heal completely.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/copd/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/,About COPD ,"increasing breathlessness when active a persistent cough with phlegm frequent chest infections Read more about the Why does COPD happen? The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring. Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer. Read more about the COPD affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing. COPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests. Read more about diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Surgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD. Read more about Financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care is also available for people with COPD. Read more about living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Can COPD be prevented? COPD does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35 and most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old. increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around a persistent cough with phlegm that never seems to go away frequent chest infections , particularly in winter wheezing Middle-aged smokers and ex-smokers who have a persistent chesty cough (especially in the morning), breathlessness on slight exertion or persistent coughs and colds in the winter should see their GP or practice nurse for a simple breathing test. If you have COPD, the airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. As the air sacs get permanently damaged, it will become increasingly difficult to breathe out. If you’re experiencing a flare-up that is worse than normal day to day, you should visit your GP or call NHS 24 on 111. Other signs of COPD Other signs of COPD can include: weight loss tiredness and fatigue swollen ankles chest infection or, less commonly, lung cancer . Your doctor will also check how well your lungs are working with a lung function test called spirometery. Spirometry To assess how well your lungs work, a breathing test called spirometry is carried out. You will be asked to breathe into a machine called a spirometer. The spirometer takes two measurements: the volume of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second or FEV 1 ) and the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity or FVC). You may be asked to breathe out a few times to get a consistent reading. The readings are compared with normal measurements for your age, which can show if your airways are obstructed. Other tests Chest X-ray A chest X-ray chest infection or lung cancer. Blood test A blood test anaemia , as this can also cause breathlessness. Further tests Computerised tomography (CT) scan Some people may need a CT scan . This provides more information than an X-ray and can be useful in diagnosing other lung diseases or assessing changes to your lungs due to COPD. Other breathing tests Phlegm sample The doctor may take a sample of phlegm (sputum) to check whether it has been infected. Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to give up smoking successfully if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as tablets, patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this. Read more about stopping smoking . Inhalers If an inhaler is prescribed for you, your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist can explain how to use it. They will check you are using it properly. Most people learn to use an inhaler successfully, but if you are having problems, a spacer or a different type of inhaler device may help you take your medicines correctly. A spacer is a device that increases the amount of medication that reaches the lungs. Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up. There are two types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler: beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline antimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropium Long-acting bronchodilator inhalers There are two types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers: beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol antimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium Steroid inhalers Steroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, work by reducing the inflammation in your airways. Pulmonary rehabilitation can greatly improve your quality of life. ","Diagnosing COPD Who is affected? COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s. If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition. Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 or read more about stopping smoking . Also avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible. There are several things that may increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), many of which can be avoided. Things you can change You can reduce your risk of developing COPD by not smoking and avoiding exposure to certain substances at work. Smoking Smoking is the main cause of COPD and is thought to be responsible for around 90% of cases. The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and permanently damaged by smoking and this damage cannot be reversed. Up to 25% of smokers develop COPD. Passive smoking Exposure to other people’s smoke increases the risk of COPD. Fumes and dust Exposure to certain types of dust and chemicals at work, including grains, isocyanates, cadmium and coal, has been linked to the development of COPD, even in people who do not smoke. The risk of COPD is even higher if you breathe in dust or fumes in the workplace and you smoke. Air pollution According to some research, air pollution may be an additional risk factor for COPD. However, at the moment it is not conclusive and research is continuing. Read further information: stopping smoking People who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop COPD at a younger age, often under 35. Read further information: British Lung Foundation: Alpha-1-antitrypsin Alpha1 Awareness UK Diagnosing COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, as well as breathing tests. When you have been taking theophylline tablets regularly, you may need to give a blood sample to measure the amount of theophylline in your blood and help your GP prescribe the appropriate dose of tablet. This will allow you to get the correct dose of theophylline while reducing the likelihood of side effects. Due to the risk of potential side effects, such as increased heart rate and headaches, other medicines, such as a bronchodilator inhaler, are usually tried before theophylline. Mucolytic tablets or capsules Mucolytics, such as carbocisteine, make the mucus and phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up. They are particularly beneficial for people with a persistent cough with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups. Antibiotics and steroid tablets If you have a chest infection, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics . Steroid tablets may also be prescribed as a short course if you have a bad flare-up. They work best if they are taken as the flare-up starts, so your GP may give you a course to keep at home. Occasionally, you may have to take a longer course of steroid tablets. Your GP will give you the lowest effective dose and monitor you for side effects. Side effects are uncommon if steroid tablets are given for less than three weeks. Read more about the medicines used in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicines guide . ","Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram may be used to check the condition of your heart. An ECG involves attaching electrodes (sticky metal patches) to your arms, legs and chest to pick up the electrical signals from your heart. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to build a detailed picture of your heart. This is similar to an ultrasound scan . Peak flow test To confirm you have COPD and not asthma, you may be asked to take regular measurements of your breathing using a peak flow meter, at different times over several days. The peak flow meter measures how fast you can breathe out. Blood oxygen level The level of oxygen in your blood is measured using a pulse oximeter, which looks like a peg and is attached to the finger. If you have low levels of oxygen, you may need an assessment to see whether extra oxygen would help you. Blood test for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency ","About COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction. Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this. Living with COPD COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact. Read more about . Flare-ups Health and Safety Executive: COPD Things you cannot change There are a few factors for COPD that you cannot change. Having a brother or sister with severe COPD A research study has shown that smokers who have brothers and sisters with severe COPD are at greater risk of developing the condition than smokers who do not. Having a genetic tendency to COPD Stop smoking Stopping smoking is the most effective way for people with COPD to help themselves feel better and is the only proven way to reduce the rate of decline in lung function. Stopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. Any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed, but giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens. Medicines Theophylline tablets Nebulised medication Nebulised medication can be used for severe cases of COPD if other inhaler devices have not worked effectively. A compressor is a machine that administers nebulised medicine through a mouthpiece or a face mask. The medicine is in a liquid form and is converted into a fine mist. This enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go. You can usually choose whether to use nebulised medication with a mouthpiece or a facemask. Your GP will advise you on how to use the machine correctly. Long-term oxygen therapy You will probably be referred for more detailed assessment to see whether you might benefit from long-term oxygen therapy. If you are prescribed long term oxygen therapy, it must be taken for at least 15 hours a day to be effective. However, the longer you use it, the more effective it is. The tubes from the machine are long so you will be able to move around your home while you are connected. Portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home. The aim of long-term oxygen therapy is to extend your life. Do not smoke when you are using oxygen. The increased level of oxygen produced is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could trigger a fire or explosion. Ambulatory oxygen therapy Part of the oxygen assessment is likely to consider if you may benefit from ambulatory oxygen – oxygen used when you walk or are active in other ways. If your oxygen levels are normal while you are resting, but fall when you exercise, you may not need long-term oxygen therapy alongside ambulatory oxygen therapy. Read more about . Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) helps a person breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face. You may receive it if you are taken to hospital because of a flare-up. You may be referred to a specialist centre to see if home NIV could help you. NIV is used to improve the functioning of your lungs. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes Pulmonary rehabilitation is a programme of exercise and education designed to help people with chronic lung problems. It can increase your exercise capacity, mobility and self-confidence. Pulmonary rehabilitation is based on a programme of physical exercise training tailored to your needs. It usually involves walking or cycling, and arm and strength-building exercises. It also includes education about your disease for you and your family, dietary assessment and advice, and psychological, social and behavioural changes designed to help you cope better.

People with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion. ME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn’t go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It can sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). ","Post-exertional malaise feeling generally unwell pain broken sleep problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’) speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties poor temperature control dizziness being very sensitive to light and sound nausea loss of appetite muscle pain (myalgia) Action for M.E. website. Frustration, anxiety , low mood and depression Your GP will usually: do a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions ask about recent travel, tick or insect bites, unusual infections, and drug and alcohol use review current medication arrange tests Dietary advice Your illness might make it more difficult for you to eat the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. Your GP may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet. Disability support advice Your GP may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust. Pacing advice Balancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of PEM. Pacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. It’s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. It can take time to change your habits and stop doing something even while things are going well. However, doing this is key to managing your condition in the long term. Counselling Counselling can support you to adjust to the impact ME/CFS can have on your life. This does not mean that the condition itself is psychological. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) CBT can sometimes be used to help changes in mood that can come with having a long-term condition. Alternative and holistic therapies Alternative or holistic therapies may provide some comfort but be cautious of any method that claims to offer a cure for ME/CFS. You should discuss any alternative or holistic therapy with your GP before you try it. Until further research is done, no one can be certain whether someone with ME/CFS might benefit from alternative therapies. Living with ME/CFS There are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition. Small changes make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management. To help with this, you might try: Planning your time Rest and relaxation This is very important for managing ME/CFS. You may need some support and advice on what that might mean for you in terms of your physical, mental and emotional activities for resting. Getting support How will ME/CFS affect my quality of life? mild moderate severe very severe How long will it last? Where can I get support? ME/CFS can have a significant emotional and financial impact on your life. A lack of understanding and awareness about ME/CFS means patients can experience disbelief, and even discrimination, from friends, family, health and social care professionals and employers. Information on entitlements to welfare benefits, accessing health and social care and others sources of support for patients and carers are available from Action for M.E . They also offer resources and services for children and young people affected by ME/CFS and their families. Peer support In some regions of Scotland there are local support groups providing peer support, information and advice. ALISS and Action for ME can assist with signposting to these groups.

It’s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis. hepatitis B infection and inherited liver diseases, such as haemochromatosis. Read more about the . The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools. Over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death. When to seek medical help In some cases, no specific cause is identified. Alcohol consumption The liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver’s cells. Men and women who drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much. If you’re a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it’s important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn’t just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you’re a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis. Alcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build. Stages of alcoholic liver damage People who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3 separate stages. The first stage of alcohol-related liver disease is known as ‘fatty liver’, which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It’s a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less. The second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20% to 30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death. About 10% of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease. This risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over 3 or more days. A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units. Read more about alcohol units . Your GP can give you help and advice if you’re finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink. Hepatitis Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis. In the UK, hepatitis C is the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs. Two other types of hepatitis infection, hepatitis B and D, can also cause cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis. NASH can develop in people who are obese, have diabetes , have high levels of fat in the blood ( high cholesterol ) and high blood pressure . Most people with NASH feel well and aren’t aware they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected. NASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of obesity and reduced physical activity. It’s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis. There are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include: autoimmune liver disease – the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs some rare, genetic conditions – such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson’s disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body) cancer of the bile ducts or pancreatic cancer Budd-Chiari syndrome – caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver Less commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis. Diagnosing cirrhosis If your GP suspects cirrhosis, they’ll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease. You may also be given a type of medication called a beta-blocker , such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that does occur. Fluid in the tummy and legs Ascites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They’ll need to be addressed as soon as possible. men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week If you have cirrhosis, you should stop drinking alcohol immediately because it speeds up the rate at which the condition progresses, regardless of the cause. Read more about alcohol misuse . Protect yourself from hepatitis Cirrhosis can be caused by infectious conditions, such as hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis B and C can be caught through having unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a condom when having sex will help you avoid the risk of getting hepatitis, as will avoiding injecting drugs. Anyone who’s at risk of getting hepatitis B, such as police officers and social care workers, can be protected by being vaccinated against the condition. However, there’s currently no vaccine for hepatitis C . ","Tests You may have a number of different tests. Blood tests Blood tests can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Scans An ultrasound scan , transient elastography scan, computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out on your liver. A transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it’s sometimes known as a Fibroscan). These scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring. The Lab Tests Online UK website has more information about ALT and AST measurements. Liver biopsy A liver biopsy is where a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope. The biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic Endoscopy An endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach. Images of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels), which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen. Grading There are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe). An alternative system called model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify people who need an urgent liver transplant. ","Preventing cirrhosis About cirrhosis Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage. Scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly. The damage caused by cirrhosis can’t be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. This is called liver failure. Each year in the UK, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need a liver transplant to survive. You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you’re overweight. A wide range of alcohol support services are available. In its more advanced stages, the scarring caused by cirrhosis can make your liver stop functioning. In this case, a liver transplant Read more about . Preventing cirrhosis Not exceeding the recommended limits for alcohol consumption is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hepatitis B and C are infections you can get by having unprotected sex or sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a condom during sex and not injecting drugs will reduce your risk of developing hepatitis B and C. A vaccine for hepatitis B is available, but there’s currently no vaccine for hepatitis C. Read more about preventing cirrhosis . Stopping cirrhosis getting worse Taking medication to treat the underlying cause of the liver damage and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems. Medication The medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver. For example, if you have viral hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication ( corticosteroids ) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants). Lifestyle changes There are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including: completely avoid alcohol , regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses lose weight if you’re overweight or obese regular exercise to reduce muscle wasting practise good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections speak to your GP about vaccinations you may need, such as the annual flu vaccine or travel vaccines speak to your GP or pharmacist if you’re taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines Malnutrition is common in people with cirrhosis, so it’s important to ensure you have a balanced diet to help you get all the nutrients you need. Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can help reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See tips for a lower salt diet for more information. The damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra calories and protein in your diet. Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals. Swollen varices If you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices. In these cases, urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital immediately. Certain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as: banding – an endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding injection glue therapy – following an endoscopy, a type of medical ‘super glue’ is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding a Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end – a special tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated; this puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding and you’ll be heavily sedated during the procedure If the fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with antibiotics . Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis to prevent infection in people at high risk. In severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks. Encephalopathy People with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn’t clearing toxins properly. laxative (it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used. Bleeding Cirrhosis can affect the liver’s ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself. Vitamin K and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. You’ll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed. Therefore, you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work. Liver transplant Your liver may stop functioning if it’s severely damaged by scarring. In this situation, a liver transplant is the only option. This is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver. However, you’ll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors. The NHSBT Organ Donation website has more information about transplants and joining the Organ Donor Register . Preventing cirrhosis You can reduce your chances of developing cirrhosis by limiting your alcohol consumption and protecting yourself from a hepatitis infection. Limiting your alcohol consumption ",
Chronic pancreatitis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/chronic-pancreatitis/,About chronic pancreatitis ,"Read more about the and diagnosing chronic pancreatitis . When to seek medical advice Always visit your GP if you’re experiencing severe pain – it’s a warning sign that something is wrong. Why it happens Long-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas. The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems. The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It’s been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases. nausea and vomiting during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe. Although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there’s often no trigger. Eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain. Advanced chronic pancreatitis The absence of digestive juices makes it difficult for your digestive system to break down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet. You may also experience: weight loss loss of appetite jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) diabetes – such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired ongoing nausea and vomiting When to seek medical advice Always visit your GP if you’re experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong. You should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting. These tests are usually carried out in your local hospital and may include: requesting a stool sample an ultrasound scan – where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas an endoscopic ultrasonography a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP Endoscopic ultrasonography During an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it. You’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure. MRCP An MRCP involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner . An MRI scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body. An MRCP is a useful way of checking whether gallstones Biopsy pancreatic cancer A biopsy involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. The needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or CT scan. Alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography. Lifestyle changes If you’re diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended. Avoiding alcohol The most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if it isn’t the cause of your condition. This helps to prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain. If you continue to drink alcohol, it’s likely that you’ll experience debilitating pain and you’ll be more likely to die from a complication of chronic pancreatitis . Some people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, talk to your GP about getting help to stop drinking. Joining a support group for people with chronic pancreatitis may also help. Talking to other people with the same condition can often help to reduce feelings of isolation and stress. Diabetes Around a third of people with chronic pancreatitis develop diabetes feeling very thirsty going to the toilet a lot, particularly at night extreme tiredness weight loss and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk) If you develop diabetes because of chronic pancreatitis, you’ll probably need to have regular insulin injections to compensate for the lack of natural insulin in your body. Pseudocysts Another common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pseudocysts (sacs of fluid which develop on the surface of your pancreas). They’re thought to affect around 1 in 10 people with chronic pancreatitis. computerised tomography (CT) scan bloating indigestion dull abdominal pain Pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. This can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. Alternatively, an endoscopy may be used. This is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid. Sometimes, pseudocysts are treated by removing part of the pancreas using laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. This is known as a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. See guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy . Pancreatic cancer Chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of developing pancreatic cancer . However, the increased risk is relatively small. For example, it’s estimated that for every 100 people with chronic pancreatitis, only 1 or 2 will develop pancreatic cancer. ","Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis smoking a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas an inherited genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas In as many as 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified – this is known as ‘idiopathic’ chronic pancreatitis. Read more about the . Who’s affected Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54. How it’s treated Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a long period of time. However, in up to 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause can’t be identified – known as ‘idiopathic’ chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol consumption Heavy drinking over many years can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis . Acute pancreatitis is usually a short-term condition, but it can recur if you continue to drink alcohol. Anyone who regularly consumes alcohol has an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, although only a minority develop the condition. Read more about alcohol misuse . Problems with the immune system Many people with autoimmune pancreatitis also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. These include ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease , both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system. Genetics Some cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. This is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called PRSS1 and SPINK-1. These mutations disrupt the normal working of the pancreas. Genetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. Evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol. Certain mutations of the CFTR gene, responsible for cystic fibrosis , are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases. injury to the pancreas blocked or narrowed openings (ducts) of the pancreas smoking radiotherapy to the abdomen (tummy) Diagnosing chronic pancreatitis Chronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas. ",Read more about ,"Complications of chronic pancreatitis About chronic pancreatitis Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation. It’s different to acute pancreatitis , where the inflammation is only short-term. The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain, which can be severe. However, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life. . Complications Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It’s important to speak to your GP if you’re experiencing stress , anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis. Diabetes is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin. People with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer . Read more about the possible complications of chronic pancreatitis . one-to-one counselling self-help groups – such as Alcoholics Anonymous a medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcohol Read more about . Stopping smoking If you smoke, you should stop. Smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function. If you want to give up smoking, it’s a good idea to start by visiting your GP. They’ll be able to give you help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking support service. These services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. Studies show you are 4 times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the NHS. Read more about stopping smoking . Dietary changes As chronic pancreatitis can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet. Your GP may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan. A low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don’t make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional. Enzyme supplements You may be given pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. These supplements may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system. Side effects of pancreatic enzyme supplements can include diarrhoea , constipation , nausea, vomiting and stomach pains. Talk to your GP if you’re experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted. Steroid medication corticosteroids ). However, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such as osteoporosis and weight gain. Pain relief Mild painkillers In most cases, the first painkiller used is paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) , such as ibuprofen . Taking NSAIDs on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers , so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect against this. Stronger painkillers If NSAIDs or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it’s likely that you’ll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. Side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness. The side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. You may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation. See the page on for more information. If you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines. Severe pain If you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. These have similar side effects to opiate-based painkillers. Long-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn’t usually recommended, because there’s a high risk of addiction. Therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery is usually recommended. In some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. Amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people. If medication isn’t effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for a few weeks or months using a procedure called a nerve block. This is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas. Severe episodes This may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose. Read more about . Surgery Surgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used. Endoscopic surgery Lithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. An endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed. Pancreas resection In cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. This type of surgery is called a pancreas resection. The technique used for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. For example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas. The different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. Simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times. Discuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision. Total pancreatectomy In the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. This is known as a total pancreatectomy. During APICT, the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed. The islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. If the APICT procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation for more information. Complications of chronic pancreatitis Complications of chronic pancreatitis are relatively common and usually caused by living with chronic pain or damage to the pancreas. Psychological effects of chronic pancreatitis Any chronic health condition, particularly one causing recurring or constant pain, can have an adverse effect on your emotional and psychological health. The International Association for the Study of Pain found that up to 94% of people with chronic pancreatitis experience pain.

Children with coeliac disease might also not grow at the expected rate, or be late to reach puberty. Pre-exisiting conditions Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions – such as type 1 diabetes, Down’s syndrome or autoimmune thyroid disease. Also, in close family members (parents or siblings) of people with coeliac disease. Genetics Coeliac disease often runs in families. If you’ve a close relative with the condition – such as a parent or sibling – your chance of developing it is higher. If you’ve an identical twin with coeliac disease, there’s an 85% chance you’ll also develop the condition. Diagnosing coeliac disease close relatives (parents, siblings or children) with coeliac disease A blood test might also be offered if: you feel tired all the time a child is not growing as fast as expected Blood tests for coeliac disease are not recommended for infants who’ve not started to eat foods containing gluten. Before a blood test Before a blood test is taken, it’s important that you eat gluten-containing foods in more than one meal every day for at least 6 weeks before the test. Remember to eat a normal gluten diet for 6 weeks before any tests. This means eating more than one meal a day that includes gluten-based foods. What’s involved in a blood test? A blood test for coeliac disease involves taking a blood sample and testing it for antibodies in the blood. You must have been eating gluten-containing food in more than 1 meal for at least 6 weeks before the test, for it to be successful. Blood tests are 95% accurate at diagnosing coeliac disease. Positive result If the coeliac antibodies are found in your blood, further investigation will be needed. This’ll be discussed with you. Biopsy A gluten-free diet will also help to prevent the complications later in life. What if I continue to eat gluten? Gluten-free food on prescription Dietary advice More common is malabsorption where your body fails to absorb nutrients from the foods you eat. This can lead to anaemia if the body doesn’t take in enough iron, and osteoporosis if there’s not enough calcium and vitamin D being taken in. More about nutritional deficiencies Osteoporosis ","Diagnosing coeliac disease What is gluten? Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Gluten is found in food and drink that contains wheat, barley and rye, such as: most types of bread pasta cakes biscuits crackers many breakfast cereals pastry certain types of sauces some types of ready meals most beers and lagers certain fruit squashes How many people have coeliac disease? Coeliac disease affects 1 person in every 100. Only about one third of them are ever diagnosed. Coeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age. Reported cases of coeliac disease are twice as high in women than men. Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It’s unknown exactly why people develop the condition. More about the If you’ve coeliac disease, you’ve an increased risk of developing osteoporosis due to the damaged gut failing to absorb key bone nutrients from food. This decreases blood vitamin and mineral levels and the body compensates for this by taking nutrients like calcium from the bones. This weakens your bones and puts you at increased risk of fracture. If you have coeliac disease, you should make sure you’re eating enough calcium and take vitamin D supplements. Read further information: NHS inform: Vitamin D NHS inform: osteoporosis Cancer Having undiagnosed or untreated coeliac disease can increase your risk of developing lymphoma and some types of bowel cancer but these are rare. Risks are reduced by following a gluten-free diet. Less common complications Less common complications of coeliac disease include low birth weight in newborn babies and in rare cases, hyposplenia.

Who’ll have a blood test A blood test should be offered if you’ve any of the following: type 1 diabetes autoimmune thyroid disease dermatitis herpetiformis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) anaemia without an obvious cause Negative result It’s sometimes possible to have coeliac disease and not have antibodies in your blood. A biopsy will only show coeliac disease if the person being tested has been eating gluten-containing foods regularly. Only after coeliac disease is confirmed can you start a gluten-free diet. If you’re already on a gluten-free diet and find it hard to eat gluten again, your GP should refer you to a specialist. You may not be able to get gluten-free foods on prescription if you do not have coeliac disease confirmed by a biopsy.

Additional blood tests You may have further blood tests to check levels of iron and other vitamins and minerals in your blood. This’ll help check for anaemia . Dual energy X-ray (DEXA) scan (adults only) In coeliac disease, a lack of nutrients caused by poor absorption can make bones weak and brittle (osteoporosis). A DEXA scan is a type of very low dose X-ray that measures bone density. This may be required if your risk score (FRAX/Qfracture) is high. This will be calculated as part of your assessment. Over-the-counter tests You can buy over-the-counter tests for coeliac disease at pharmacies. There isn’t enough evidence that these tests are reliable. If you’ve used one, it’s important that you talk to your GP about the result.

What’s involved in a biopsy? If you need to have a biopsy, a thin flexible tube with a light called an endoscope will be inserted into your mouth or nose and passed down to your small intestine. Before the procedure, a local anaesthetic is given to numb the throat and/or a sedative to help you relax. During the procedure, the endoscopist will pass a tiny biopsy tool through the endoscope to take samples of the lining of your small intestine. The sample will then be examined under a microscope for signs of coeliac disease. For those under 16 years the endoscopy would be under an anaesthetic.

Constipation,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/constipation/,About constipation ,". When you’re constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual. Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3 or 4 days.

Read complications of constipation for more information about faecal impaction. A typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You’ll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected. blood tests or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions. Other tests you may have include: an abdominal X-ray – where X-ray radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen transit study examination – where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on X-rays; one or more X-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system anorectal manometry – where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working As there’s an increased risk of bowel cancer Lifestyle advice ","Diagnosing constipation Read more about the It’s often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including: not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits ignoring the urge to pass stools side effects of certain medications not drinking enough fluids anxiety or depression In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation. Read more about the . Who’s affected Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It’s estimated that around 1 in every 7 adults and up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any one time. The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. When to get professional advice haemorrhoids (piles) faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum) bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools) Read more about the complications of constipation . Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry. Most cases of constipation aren’t caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including: not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits having limited privacy when using the toilet ignoring the urge to pass stools immobility or lack of exercise not drinking enough fluids having a high temperature (fever) being underweight or overweight anxiety or depression psychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma Medication Constipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you’re taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include: aluminium antacids (medicine to treat indigestion ) antidepressants antiepileptics (medicine to treat epilepsy ) antipsychotics (medicine to treat schizophrenia and other mental health conditions) calcium supplements opiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine diuretics (water tablets) iron supplements If constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine.

They may be able to advise you on how to treat the problem, or they might recommend you see your GP for an alternative medicine if appropriate. Pregnancy About 2 in every 5 women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages. Constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant. The bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along. If you’re pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby.

It’s estimated that up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training can all be responsible. Poor diet Children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don’t get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it’s very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet. Toilet training It’s important that you don’t make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It’s also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they’re using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation. Toilet habits Some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a phobia about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school. This fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse. Other conditions In rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: Hirschsprung’s disease – which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools anorectal malformation – where the baby’s anus and rectum don’t form properly spinal cord abnormalities – including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy cystic fibrosis Diagnosing constipation However, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications. Rectal bleeding Continually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding. In some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it’s more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles) . Piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus. As well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus.

Your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don’t help. Laxatives Laxatives are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system. Bulk-forming laxatives Your pharmacist will usually start you on a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass. Commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk, methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don’t take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative. Osmotic laxatives If your stools remain hard after you’ve taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them. Commonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect of the laxative. Stimulant laxatives If your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus. The most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours. According to your individual preference and how quickly you need relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives. How long will I need to take laxatives for? If you’ve had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed. However, if your constipation is caused by an underlying medical condition or a medicine you’re taking, your GP may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or even years. If you’ve been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you’ll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months. Your GP will advise you about when it’s best to stop taking long-term laxatives. Faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along. Sometimes as a result of impaction, overflow diarrhoea may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this. If you have faecal impaction, you’ll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative. If you don’t respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the following medications. Suppository – this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. The suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form. Mini enema – where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. Docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way. Pregnancy or breastfeeding If you’re pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You’ll also be advised to do gentle exercise. If dietary and lifestyle changes don’t work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly. Lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren’t absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won’t feel the effects of the laxative. Laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don’t work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives). However, senna may not be suitable if you’re in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it’s partially absorbed by your digestive system. Read more about constipation and other common pregnancy problems . Babies who haven’t been weaned If your baby is constipated but hasn’t started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you’re using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don’t dilute the mixture. You may want to try gently moving your baby’s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels. Babies who are eating solids If your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be puréed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are: apples apricots grapes peaches pears plums prunes raspberries strawberries Never force your baby to eat food if they don’t want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience. If your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren’t suitable for babies, so they’ll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn’t work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative. Children For children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary. As well as eating fruit, older children should have a healthy, balanced diet , which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or using the toilet. It’s important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they’ve passed as many stools as possible. To encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child’s bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully. Complications of constipation See your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding. Faecal impaction Long-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus. Once you have faecal impaction, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get rid of the stools naturally. Faecal impaction makes constipation worse because it’s harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed. Faecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including: swelling of the rectum a loss of sensation in and around your anus bowel incontinence bleeding from your anus rectal prolapse – where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur as a result of repeated straining in people with chronic constipation) Faecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used. Preventing constipation There are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes. Fibre Including enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don’t eat enough fibre. You should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more: fruit and vegetables wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta wholemeal bread seeds and oats Eating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer. It’s important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind ( flatulence ) and experience stomach cramps. Read more about how to increase your intake of fibre and eating a healthy, balanced diet . Fluids Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration , and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it’s hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume. Toilet habits Never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation. When going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably. Exercise Keeping active and mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week. As well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.

Stay at home advice If you’ve had a positive test result, and have completed 5 days of self-isolation Although many people will no longer be infectious to others after 5 days, some people may be infectious to other people for up to 10 days from the start of their infection. If you have a high temperature or still feel unwell after the 5 days, continue to try to stay at home. Try to stay at home until you: feel well enough to go back to normal activities no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) This will help reduce the risk of spreading the virus. You should avoid meeting people at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from coronavirus, especially those whose immune system means that they are at higher risk of serious illness from coronavirus for 10 days after the day you took your test. If you’ve received a positive test result and have been following the stay at home advice, you do not need to test after the 5 day period unless you’ve been advised to do so by a health professional.

Clostridium difficile,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/clostridium-difficile/,"Clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea. The infection most commonly affects people who have recently been treated with antibiotics , but can spread easily to others. C. difficile infections are unpleasant and can sometimes cause serious bowel problems, but they can usually be treated with another course of antibiotics. ","watery diarrhoea , which can be bloody painful tummy cramps feeling sick signs of dehydration , such as a dry mouth , headaches and peeing less often than normal a high temperature (fever) of above 38C (100.4F) loss of appetite and weight loss In some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting. Who’s most at risk of C. difficile? C. difficile mostly affects people who: have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that work against several types of bacteria) or several different antibiotics at the same time, or those taking long-term antibiotics have had to stay in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or care home, for a long time are over 65 years old have certain underlying conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cancer or kidney disease have a weakened immune system, which can be because of a condition such as diabetes , such as confusion, drowsiness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all If your GP is closed, phone 111. Diarrhoea can be caused by a number of conditions and is a common side effect of antibiotics, so having diarrhoea while taking antibiotics doesn’t necessarily mean you have a C. difficile infection. Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to confirm whether you have C. difficile. A blood test may also be carried out to help determine how severe the infection is, and sometimes you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged. Looking after yourself at home Do make sure you finish the entire course of any antibiotics you’re prescribed, even if you’re feeling better drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration and eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread if you feel hungry take paracetamol for tummy pain or a fever regularly wash your hands and contaminated surfaces, objects or sheets stay at home until at least 48 hours after your last episode of diarrhoea Don’t do not take anti-diarrhoeal medication, as this can stop the infection being cleared from your body How you get C. difficile C. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control. However, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in the bowel, which can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply and produce toxins that make the person ill. When this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person’s diarrhoea. Once out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they’re thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth. How to stop C. difficile spreading C. difficile infections can be passed on very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home and in healthcare settings. The following measures can help: wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet and before eating – use liquid rather than bar soap and don’t use flannels or nail brushes clean contaminated surfaces – such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles – with a bleach-based cleaner after each use don’t share towels and flannels wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature when visiting someone in hospital, observe any visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not effective against C. difficile avoid visiting hospital if you’re feeling unwell or have recently had diarrhoea ",,,"chemotherapy or steroid medication are taking a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of stomach acid they produce have had surgery on their digestive system Many C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and care homes. However, strict infection control measures have helped to reduce this risk, and an increasing number of C. difficile infections now occur outside these settings. When to get medical advice Visiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection can put others at risk, so it’s best to phone your GP or NHS 111 if you’re concerned or feel you need advice. Phone your GP if: you have persistent diarrhoea after finishing a course of antibiotics you have bloody diarrhoea you have diarrhoea and experience severe tummy pain, a high fever, a rapid heart rate or fainting you have taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill C. difficile bacteria rarely, serious infections may require surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowel ",
Common heart conditions,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/common-heart-conditions/,There are many different heart conditions and problems which are collectively called heart disease. ,"Heart failure Read more about heart failure Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms) The heart muscle has its own electrical system which helps to stimulate the heartbeat. If the electrical signals within your heart are interrupted or disturbed, your heart can beat too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) and/or in an irregular way. This is called an arrhythmia. Read about arrhythmia on the Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland website Valve disease shortness of breath swollen ankles fatigue chest pain (angina or palpitations) dizziness or fainting Read about heart valve problems on the Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland website High blood pressure Another condition which can affect the heart is high blood pressure or hypertension. Although it’s not a disease in itself, hypertension can lead to an increased risk of developing serious conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes. Read more about high blood pressure and reducing the risks to your heart Congenital heart conditions Congenital heart conditions occur when there’s an abnormality or defect with the structure of the heart of a developing foetus while inside the mother’s womb. A baby may be born with only one defect or with several defects. Some types of congenital heart defects are life-threatening, either immediately to the newborn or over time. Read more about congenital heart disease Inherited heart conditions Inherited conditions can be passed on through families. They are sometimes called familial or genetic heart conditions. They can affect people of any age and can be life-threatening. The first sign there’s a problem is often when someone dies suddenly with no obvious cause. These conditions are different from most congenital heart conditions, although some congenital conditions can also be inherited. Read more about inherited heart conditions ",,"Heart disease and different conditions affect the heart’s ability to work efficiently. It can be worrying and confusing to be diagnosed with a heart condition, but there’s a lot of information and support available to you. Sometimes understanding what is happening can help you worry less. Coronary heart disease The most common heart condition in Scotland is coronary heart disease. This is caused when the heart’s blood vessels – the coronary arteries – become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply enough blood to the heart. It can lead to angina and/or a heart attack. Read more about coronary heart disease Angina Angina is a pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, stomach or jaw that happens when the blood supply to your heart becomes restricted because of your arteries becoming narrowed. This clogging is called atheroma. Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease, not an illness in itself. Angina is your heart’s way of telling you it’s not getting enough oxygen when you’re doing something strenuous or you’re feeling under stress. Many people learn to recognise how much activity will bring on an angina attack – this is called stable angina. If you have unexplained chest pain, seek urgent medical advice – you will need an assessment of your overall health. Unstable angina Unstable angina can be undiagnosed chest pain or a sudden worsening of existing angina. It happens when the blood supply to the heart is severely restricted and angina attacks occur more frequently, with less and less activity. These attacks may even happen at rest or wake you from sleep. They can last up to 10 minutes. You should see your doctor urgently, and you may be admitted to hospital. Read m ore about angina Heart attack A heart attack – also known as myocardial infarction or MI – happens when the blood supply to part of your heart muscle becomes completely blocked. This is most commonly caused by a piece of fatty material breaking off and a blood clot forms within a coronary artery. This can cause damage to the part of your heart muscle which that particular coronary artery was supplying. Read more about the ",,
Common cold,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/common-cold/,A cold is a very common mild viral infection. You can often treat a cold without seeing a GP.

Anxiety disorders in children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/anxiety-disorders-in-children/,"It’s normal for children to feel worried or anxious from time to time, like when they’re starting school or nursery, or moving to a new area. Anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear. It’s an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event. But for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis. This can interfere with their school, home and social life. If your child is anxious for a period of time and it’s impacting on day to day life you may need to speak to a healthcare professional to help support your child. For example, if they feel they cannot go to school or see their friends anymore. So how do you know when your child’s anxiety has reached this stage? What are the signs of anxiety in children? Anxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed. Some of the signs to look out for in your child are: finding it hard to concentrate not sleeping, or waking in the night not eating properly quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts constantly worrying or having negative thoughts feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often always crying being clingy all the time (when other children are ok) complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell being withdrawn and not wanting to do things they used to enjoy Your child may not be old enough to recognise why they’re feeling this way. The reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety is common in younger children. Older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health. What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience? The common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are : A fear or phobia about something specific Young children are commonly afraid of things like the dark or imaginary things like monsters. This is a normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child’s day-to-day life. Read about phobias Feeling anxious for most of the time for no apparent reason It’s normal for children to frequently have fears and worries. Some anxious children may develop a condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they get older. Generalised anxiety disorder ",,"People affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. Separation anxiety Separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer. It’s common in young children, and normally develops at about 6 months of age. It can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult. Separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they’re feeling insecure about something. They could be reacting to changes at home or at school, for example. Social anxiety Social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities. Social ‘shyness’ is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers. However it becomes a problem – ‘social anxiety disorder’ – when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating. Social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who’ve gone through puberty. School-based anxiety Some children become anxious about going to school. This could also be about schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they’re changing school or moving up a level. They may not always share these worries with you, and instead they may say they have a tummy ache or are feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning. This may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life. Less common anxiety disorders Post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults. ",,"You should seek help for your child’s anxiety if: you feel it’s not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked you think it’s slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships it happens very frequently or they feel anxious all the time it’s making them feel physically unwell a lot of the time like feeling sick or having constant headaches your child becomes very withdrawn and is anxious about doing things they used to enjoy How serious can it be? Long-term anxiety can severely interfere with a child’s personal development, family life and schooling. Anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood. Teenagers with an anxiety disorder can also: experience clinical depression feel hopeless misuse drugs What can I do to help my child? If a child is experiencing anxiety, there’s plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it’s important to listen to your child about their anxiety or worries. Where should I go for help? You can talk to your GP or someone at your child’s school like the school nurse. You might want to do this on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The healthcare professional should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next. Your child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). CAMHS staff are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include: psychologists psychiatrists nurses occupational therapists physiotherapists and other specially trained professionals They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child. More about CAMHS Youth counselling services If your child doesn’t want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service. Youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what’s worrying them, and get advice. For more information, search Scotland’s Service Directory for mental health and wellbeing services in your area. Counselling may also be available in your local school. Telephone or online help Telephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people. They might feel it’s easier to talk to someone who doesn’t know them. How do you treat anxiety disorders? It can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what’s worrying them to a trained person, especially as it’s someone they don’t know. If your child is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they’re at a youth counselling service, it might be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist. These sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation. Psychological therapies Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. It’s been proven to help with anxiety and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious. Your child will work with the psychological therapist to find ways to change the way they think. They’ll help your child to find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. The psychological therapies matrix describes the most helpful talking therapies for anxiety. What is psychological therapy? Medication If your child’s anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication. A type of antidepressant , called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things. Antidepressants usually take around 2 to 4 weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately. It’s natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen. Why are some children affected and others not? Some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children. Sometimes traumatic life events like an illness, or an accident, can cause anxiety. This can happen even if your child was previously confident by nature before. A child’s anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they’ve inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger. Life events Some children can also develop anxiety after a series of difficult life events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together, or a traumatic single event, may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are: frequently moving house and school – it can be hard to settle when you’re always expecting change divorce or separation of parents death of a close relative or friend becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident having someone in the family who is ill or disabled school-related issues like homework or exams, or bullying or friendship problems becoming involved in crime being abused or neglected Medical conditions Children with certain conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders ",
Congenital heart disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/,About congenital heart disease ,"breathlessness chest pain palpitations fainting fatigue Acyanotic heart disease Acyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it’s pumped abnormally around the body. In this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body. breathlessness fatigue dizziness fainting How common is congenital heart disease? Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition. Some babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood. Congenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as Down’s syndrome . An infection during pregnancy, such as rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease. However, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause. Outlook for congenital heart disease The outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect. As stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart disease a blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis) palpitations fainting fatigue chest pains breathing problems Children with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia. severe tiredness palpitations chest pain shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs) These include: poor appetite and feeding difficulties sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding delayed growth Children with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age. Find out more about aortic stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website . Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth. When an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby’s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta. Therefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs. Shortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. However, in cases of PDA, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs. This can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct. Common types of cyanotic heart disease Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. TOF is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. Tetralogy is a Greek word that means ‘four-fold’, and Fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition. In cases of TOF, there are four defects that affect the heart: A hole between the left and right ventricle (Ventricular Septal Defect). A narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis). The muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy). The aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta). As a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. This leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body. Find out more about TOF on the British Heart Foundation website . Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease. Find out more about TGA on the British Heart Foundation website . Risk factors for congenital heart disease In many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart. The known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below. Maternal diabetes Women with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes. It is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect. The increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus. Rubella The viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy. If a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease. Maternal alcohol abuse Mothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease. Alcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult. Genetic conditions There are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease. Down’s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. Down’s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of children with Down’s syndrome will have congenital heart disease. Other genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include: Turner syndrome Noonan syndrome Diagnosing congenital heart disease An increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born. A foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby’s heart. It should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy. It is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography. Possible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include: problems feeding slow growth shortness of breath after exercising tiredness after exercising swelling of their hands, feet and ankles Further testing Echocardiogram An echocardiogram may be used to check your child’s heart. Sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up. Find out more about an echocardiogram on the British Heart Foundation website . Electrocardiogram (ECG) An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child’s heart. Electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ECG machine. The machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm. Find out more about an ECG on the British Heart Foundation website . Chest X-ray A chest X-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. Both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease. Find out more about a chest x-ray on the British Heart Foundation website. Pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood. The test involves placing a special sensor on your child’s fingertip, ear or toe. The sensor sends out light waves. A computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading. A healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. It is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value. Cardiac catheterisation Cardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child’s heart. During a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child’s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. The tube is moved up into the heart, using X-rays to help guide it. During a BT shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. Further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. During open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened. Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born. A surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of TGA. During an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart. Congenital heart disease in adulthood About 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. Living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. Some adults will require specialised care. fever chills sweating (including night sweats) muscular aches and pains chest pain coughs weakness and fatigue headache shortness of breath Endocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). This will involve a hospital stay for several weeks. Endocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart. Due to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease. It is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings. ","Diagnosing congenital heart disease This poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease. Congenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as ‘grown-up congenital heart disease’ (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD). Congenital and rare condition register Babies with congenital heart disease are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland. The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information. It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services. Further information about CARDRISS To understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child’s heart and general health, it’s useful to first understand how a healthy heart works. Find out how your heart works, on the British Heart Foundation website . Congenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart’s structure prevent it from working as it should. As outlined in the introduction , the two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart disease Common types of acyanotic heart disease Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. In cases of VSD, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle. As blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle. The heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. The excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension). Atrial septal defect (ASD) Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a similar type of defect to VSD, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles. ASD can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs. When referring to a ‘hole in the heart’, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either VSD or ASD. Find out more about ASD on the British Heart Foundation website . Pulmonary stenosis In pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart. Find out more about pulmonary stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website . Aortic stenosis In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. ","Cardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure. The advantage of this type of surgery is that it’s minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery. Open heart surgery For more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart. During open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child’s body (bypass machine). An incision is made in your child’s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced. Heart transplant In more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. In this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart. If your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the National Transplant Database (NTD). Depending on the condition of your child’s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. Machines, such as the ventricle assist device (VAD), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body. Priority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. If your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time. Once a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. You may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible. Find out more about heart transplantation on the British Heart Foundation website. ","Complications of congenital heart disease About congenital heart disease Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart. Types of congenital heart disease There are over 30 different types of heart defect. The two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart disease Cyanotic heart disease Cyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn’t enough oxygen present in the blood. Babies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen. There are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. Some of these are explained below. Catheters Septal defects In cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. The catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect. In cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. This involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect. Stenosis In mild cases, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended. Medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child’s heart and lungs. In more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. A small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. This is known as a balloon angioplasty. Once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. Sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened. In more serious cases of stenosis, it’s sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. Replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. Pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart. For people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. The catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. A replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position. Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) Many cases of patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication. Two types of medication – indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen – have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for PDA. If a PDA does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Due to these factors, it’s recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. The clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice. Complications of congenital heart disease Many children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking. Some children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance. If your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (IEP). The IEP makes an assessment of your child’s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist. The IEP will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. Children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided. Endocarditis Both children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart. ",
Deafblindness,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/eyes/deafblindness/,About deafblindness ,"Seeing your GP Visit your GP if you think your hearing and/or eyesight may be getting worse. If you’re worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP. A person who’s deafblind won’t usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause difficulties with everyday activities. The hearing and/or vision problems may be present from birth, but in many cases one or both problems develop gradually as a person gets older and they may not notice it themselves at first. If someone you know has a combination of the signs mentioned below, it’s possible they have some degree of deafblindness and should seek medical advice. Signs of a hearing problem Hearing loss can occur from birth or may develop gradually or suddenly later on. Signs that someone may have a problem with their hearing include: not hearing you if you speak to them from behind needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio difficulty following a conversation – particularly if several people are speaking or the person they’re speaking to is unfamiliar not hearing noises around them, such as a knock at the door or the doorbell ringing asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly leaning in very close to hear what’s being said If someone already has a hearing problem – for example, they wear a hearing aid or use sign language – keep an eye out for signs of vision problems that could develop (see below). Signs of a vision problem Vision loss can also be present from birth or develop later on. Signs that someone may have a problem with their vision include: problems seeing in low light or bright light difficulty recognising people they know finding it hard to read facial expressions relying on touch to find and identify items more than usual needing to hold books or newspapers close to their face, or sitting near the television difficulty moving around unfamiliar places – they may bump into or trip over things regularly not looking directly at you or making proper eye contact If a person already has a problem with their vision – for example, they wear glasses, use a cane to get around, or have a condition such as glaucoma or cataracts – keep an eye out for signs of hearing problems that could develop (see above). Getting medical advice Visit your GP if you notice any deterioration in your hearing or eyesight. If you’re worried about a friend or family member’s vision and hearing, encourage them to speak to their GP. ","Diagnosing deafblindness Managing deafblindness About deafblindness Deafblindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person’s ability to communicate, access information and get around. It’s also sometimes called ‘dual sensory loss’ or ‘multi-sensory impairment’. A deafblind person won’t usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life. These problems can occur even if hearing loss and vision loss are mild, as the 2 senses work together and 1 would usually help compensate for loss of the other. Signs of deafblindness Deafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children. In older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first. Signs of a problem can include: needing to turn up the volume on the television or radio difficulty following a conversation not hearing noises such as a knock at the door asking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly needing to hold books or newspapers very close, or sitting close to the television difficulty moving around unfamiliar places If someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it’s important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too.

Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they’ll have their own individual care needs. The general aims of care for a deafblind person are to: Deafblindness from birth Deafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness. It can be caused by: problems associated with premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles), toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) genetic conditions, such as CHARGE syndrome or Down’s syndrome cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination foetal alcohol syndrome – health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy Deafblindness later in life In most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness. A person with acquired deafblindness may be born without a hearing or sight problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem, and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on. Problems that can contribute to acquired deafblindness include: age-related hearing loss Usher syndrome – a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance eye problems associated with increasing age, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts and glaucoma diabetic retinopathy – a complication of diabetes where the cells lining the back of the eye are damaged by high blood sugar levels damage to the brain, such as from meningitis , encephalitis, a stroke or severe head injury Sense has . Diagnosing deafblindness Deafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life. Speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child’s hearing and/or vision at any point. If you’re worried about a family member or friend, try to encourage them to speak to their GP. Newborn screening If your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during newborn screening . These are a series of checks carried out to see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing. If no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older. Hearing and vision tests for adults In most cases, deafblindness develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first. It’s therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years. You can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing. A person may be diagnosed with deafblindness if tests show they have both hearing and vision problems. Their hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed even after they’ve been diagnosed, as the level of care and support they need will depend on how severely each sense is affected. Find your local optometry practice Specialist assessment As soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by the local authority. The assessment should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who is able to identify the deafblind person’s abilities and needs. The assessment should include assessing their needs in relation to: communication one-to-one human contact social interaction emotional wellbeing support with mobility assistive technology rehabilitation The assessment will also take into account the person’s current needs and those that develop in the future. A deafblind person should have access to services suitable to their level of hearing and sight and their individual needs. Mainstream services aimed mainly at blind or deaf people may not always be appropriate. Read more about the Most deafblind people will still have some hearing and/or vision. The level of care and support they need will depend on how severe their hearing and vision problems are. Individual care plan The individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they’re diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up. The care plan will aim to: preserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has teach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet (see below) help the person retain as much independence as possible – for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog or through the provision of a communicator guide for young children, ensure their educational needs are met Read further information Sense: Benefits and money Sense: Support for disabled children and young people Communication systems As deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.

Specially designed items, such as telephones and keyboards, may also help someone who is visually impaired. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has more information about everyday living with vision loss , including advice about the technology available to help with everyday tasks. Many libraries stock a selection of large-print books and ‘talking books’, where the text is read aloud and recorded onto a CD. The RNIB also offer a talking book subscription service , where books can be ordered and delivered directly to your home for a small annual fee. Read further information: RNIB: Assistive aids and technology Hearing aids and implants Some deafblind people may benefit from wearing a hearing aid. There are various hearing aid styles available to suit different types of hearing loss and personal preference. Hearing aids use microphones to collect the sound from the environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. An audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing. For some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. In these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant. While these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system.

Croup,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/croup/,About croup ,"and diagnosing croup Why does croup happen? Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus. Read more about the A single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat. It is extremely rare for a child to die from croup. There are a number of conditions that can follow croup, such as pneumonia and middle ear infection . Read more about the complications of croup . Preventing croup Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent. Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces. A number of your child’s routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include: MMR – protection from measles, mumps and rubella DTaP/IPV/Hib – protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b A child can get croup at any time of the year, although it’s more likely to occur during late autumn or early winter. This may be because there are more viruses, such as colds and flu, around at this time of year. a bark-like cough a hoarse or croaky voice difficulty breathing a harsh grating sound when breathing in, called stridor Stridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. But in more severe cases of croup it can also occur when the child is resting or sleeping. sore throat runny nose cough high temperature (fever) When to seek medical advice Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and mild cases can be treated at home. Take your child to A&E or phone 999 if your child: has severe breathing difficulties has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing) has a worsening cough or rasping sound shows distress and agitation has dark, blue-tinged or pale skin the skin around their ribs and chest appears to be pulled in and tight, making the bones of their chest and ribs more visible has abnormal drowsiness and sleepiness has an inability to drink fluids You should take them to your nearest hospital’s accident and emergency department or dial 999 for an ambulance. In some cases, a pulse oximetry test may be carried out. This involves clipping a sensor onto your child’s earlobe or finger to find out their oxygen levels. The test does not hurt and should not distress your child, and determines whether your child is absorbing enough oxygen into their blood. Your GP will decide whether your child needs to be admitted to hospital or whether their croup is safe to treat at home. You should not try to check your child’s throat yourself, because it could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. This could cause the airway to swell even more, making breathing even more difficult. Ruling out other conditions an abnormality of the airway, which has been present from birth an abscess in the tissues in the back of the throat inhaled material (something they have breathed in) swelling of the deeper layers of the skin (angio-oedema) epiglottitis congenital lesion an allergic reaction However, if your child has severe croup, they will need to be admitted to hospital urgently. Your GP will usually prescribe a single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone to help reduce swelling (inflammation) in your child’s throat. Side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache. Painkillers for children Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen , are available in liquid form for children. You can get liquid paracetamol and ibuprofen over the counter from pharmacies and some supermarkets. Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin. Speak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of painkiller is suitable for your child. If your child is very distressed and finding it difficult to breathe, they will be given oxygen through an oxygen mask. As with milder cases of croup, oral dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually be given to help reduce any swelling in your child’s airways. In rare cases croup may require hospitalisation, where a child may need intubation. During intubation, a tube is inserted either through a nostril or the mouth and passed down into the windpipe. This will help your child breathe more easily. Intubation is usually performed under general anaesthetic . This means your child will be completely unconscious throughout the procedure so they do not experience pain or distress. Complications of croup Complications that develop as a result of croup are rare. Airway obstruction If an obstructed airway is not treated promptly, it can lead to: severe breathing difficulty (respiratory distress) respiratory arrest (where breathing stops but the heart continues beating) Always phone 999 for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe. Your child may find it difficult to drink fluids as a result of an obstruction in their airway. However, it is important they have plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . If your child refuses fluids, try not to force them. This could distress your child and make the condition worse. Secondary infection A secondary infection can sometimes develop following the initial viral infection that caused croup. A secondary infection can potentially cause: pneumonia ","Diagnosing croup Who is affected by croup? Croup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds. However, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare. The condition is more common during the late autumn and early winter months. It tends to affect more boys than girls. A child may experience croup more than once during childhood. Parainfluenza virus The parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup. Four strains of the virus are responsible for most croup cases. These are: parainfluenza I parainfluenza II parainfluenza III parainfluenza IV Parainfluenza I is responsible for most cases of croup. The virus can be transmitted through close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. As with many airborne viruses, the parainfluenza virus is often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes. Other viruses A number of other viruses can also cause croup. These include: influenza A and B (flu viruses) the measles virus, in children who have not been immunised against measles the rhinovirus (common cold virus) enteroviruses the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems and pneumonia in babies inhaling a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body) epiglottitis – inflammation of the epiglottis, (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe) an allergic reaction to substances such as pollen or dust mites inhalation of irritants, such as chemicals acid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat ( acid reflux ) Diagnosing croup Further investigation bacterial tracheitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that can occur after a viral respiratory infection Other complications Although rare, other possible complications of croup can include middle ear infection and lymphadenitis, an infection of the glands of the immune system (lymph nodes). ",,"Complications of croup About croup Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx). Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked. Take your child to A&E or phone 999 if your child: has severe breathing difficulties has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing) has a worsening cough or rasping sound shows distress and agitation has dark, blue-tinged or pale skin the skin around their ribs and chest appears to be pulled in and tight, making the bones of their chest and ribs more visible has abnormal drowsiness and sleepiness has an inability to drink fluids Contact your GP or, if your GP’s closed, phone 111 if: is less than 3 months old and has a temperature of 38 °C or above is aged 3 months or older and has a temperature of 39 °C or above your child has a distinctive barking cough your child makes a harsh sound when they breathe in Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. Read more about the Read more about Complications An X-ray may be recommended if it is thought your child may have inhaled something and it is obstructing their airway. If your GP thinks your child has mild croup, they will usually recommend managing it at home. This will often involve using children’s paracetamol to ease any pain associated with the condition and may help lower your child’s temperature if they have a fever. You should also ensure your child is well hydrated by encouraging them to drink plenty of fluids. Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath, are a major symptom of severe croup. You should dial 999 immediately for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe. ",

They might recommend more tests, such as: gastroscopy – a thin flexible tube with a camera is put into your mouth to look at your food pipe and stomach colonoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel a colon capsule endoscopy (pill camera) X-ray or barium enema MRI scan or CT scan You will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them. Steroid medication side effects Medicines to suppress your immune system Common types include azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Biological therapies If steroids and immunosuppressants don’t help or aren’t right for you, biological therapies may be used. itchy skin a high temperature joint and muscle pain swelling of the hands or lips problems swallowing Surgery Surgery to treat Crohn’s disease may be an option if: you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects your quality of life is severely affected by your condition you have serious complications of Crohn’s disease Surgery might involve widening narrow parts of your bowel, or removing parts of it (resection). Resection involves removing the inflamed area of the intestine. If you have a resection, you might have the healthy sections of bowel joined back together. Or you might have the end of your small bowel joined to the skin of your tummy (an ileostomy or stoma). In this case, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear. An ileostomy might be temporary, to give your bowel time to heal, or it might be permanent. Your IBD team will tell you what surgery they recommend and let you know what to expect. Diet and smoking Do eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains drink plenty of water Do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need. You can speak to your IBD team about: removing trigger foods from your diet taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet being referred to a dietitian If you smoke, it is advised that you make every effort to stop smoking , especially if you need to have surgery. If you smoke, smoking can make Crohn’s worse and is it important that you make every effort to stop smoking . Fertility and pregnancy A woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by Crohn’s disease. However, surgery for Crohn’s disease might affect your fertility. Most women with Crohn’s disease will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. But if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your IBD team. This is because they may need to change your medication. If you’re having a flare-up of Crohn’s disease you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control. Complications Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system. This can result in complications such as: narrowing of the bowel (stricture) a channel developing between your bowel and your skin, another section of bowel or a body organ (fistula) ","Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage. But it mostly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon). Crohn’s disease can affect people of all ages, but it’s usually diagnosed between the age of 15 and 40. The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown. A combination of factors may be responsible, including: genetics – genes you inherit from your parents environmental factors – like air pollution, medication or previous infections ",Your GP will usually ask you about: ,"corticosteroids Common types are adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab. Information about you If you have Crohn’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register ",

The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee. If you think you have deep vein thrombosis ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 pain and swelling of the leg, along with either breathlessness or chest pain Pulmonary embolism This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream. This then blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs, preventing blood from reaching them. D-dimer test blood test called a D-dimer test. This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein. However, the D-dimer test isn’t always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot. Venogram Read more Compression stockings should be fitted professionally and your prescription should be reviewed every 3 to 6 months. The stockings need to be worn all day but can be taken off before going to bed or in the evening while you rest with your leg raised. A spare pair of compression stockings should also be provided. Exercise Raising your leg As well as wearing compression stockings, you might be advised to raise your leg whenever you’re resting. This helps to relieve the pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf itself. When raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. This will help the returning blood flow from your calf. Putting a cushion underneath your leg while you’re lying down should help raise your leg above the level of your hip. You can also slightly raise the end of your bed to ensure that your foot and calf are slightly higher than your hip. Read more about preventing DVT Inferior vena cava filters breathing difficulties . A large clot can cause the lungs to collapse, resulting in heart failure , which can be fatal. About one in 10 people with an untreated DVT develops a severe pulmonary embolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome calf pain swelling a rash ulcers on the calf (in severe cases) When a DVT develops in your thigh vein, there’s an increased risk of post-thrombotic syndrome occurring. It’s also more likely to occur if you’re overweight or if you’ve had more than one DVT in the same leg. returning and may help prevent or improve complications of DVT , such as post-thrombotic syndrome. Read more about ","breathlessness – which may come on gradually or suddenly chest pain – which may become worse when you breathe in sudden collapse Each year, DVT affects around 1 person in every 1,000 in the UK. Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also some other risk factors, including: having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism having a family history of blood clots being inactive for long periods – such as after an operation or during a long journey blood vessel damage – a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot Read more about the Diagnosing DVT Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) sometimes occurs for no apparent reason. However, the risk of developing DVT is increased in certain circumstances. Inactivity When you’re inactive your blood tends to collect in the lower parts of your body, often in your lower legs. This is usually nothing to worry about because when you start to move, your blood flow increases and moves evenly around your body. However, if you’re unable to move for a long period of time – such as after an operation, because of an illness or injury, or during a long journey – your blood flow can slow down considerably. A slow blood flow increases the chances of a blood clot forming. In hospital If you have to go into hospital for an operation or procedure, your risk of getting a blood clot increases. This is because DVT is more likely to occur when you’re unwell or inactive, or less active than usual. Pregnancy During pregnancy, blood clots more easily. It’s the body’s way of preventing too much blood being lost during childbirth. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) – DVT and pulmonary embolism – affects about 1 in 100,000 women of childbearing age. DVTs are also rare in pregnancy, although pregnant women are up to 10 times more likely to develop thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age. A clot can form at any stage of pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after the birth. Having thrombophilia (a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to clot), or having a parent, or brother or sister, who’s had a thrombosis, increase your risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy. Other risk factors during pregnancy include: being over 35 years old being obese (with a BMI of 30 or more) expecting 2 or more babies having recently had a caesarean section being immobile for long periods of time smoking (find out how to stop smoking ) having severe varicose veins dehydration Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is usually used to treat pregnant women with DVT. LMWH is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. It’s given by injection and doesn’t affect your developing baby. Contraceptive pill and HRT The combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) progestogen-only contraceptive pill . Your risk of getting DVT is also increased if you or a close relative have previously had DVT and: you’re overweight or obese you smoke you’re dehydrated you’re over 60 – particularly if you have a condition that restricts your mobility Warfarin Warfarin for more information. If you’re thought to be at risk of developing DVT, your healthcare team can take a number of measures to prevent a blood clot forming. Before going into hospital If you’re going into hospital to have an operation, and you’re taking the combined contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) , you’ll be advised to temporarily stop taking your medication four weeks before your operation. Similarly, if you’re taking medication to prevent blood clots, such as aspirin , you may be advised to stop taking it one week before your operation. There’s less risk of getting DVT when having a local anaesthetic compared with a general anaesthetic . Your doctor will discuss whether it’s possible for you to have a local anaesthetic. While you’re in hospital There are a number of things your healthcare team can do to help reduce your risk of getting DVT while you’re in hospital. For example, they’ll make sure you have enough to drink so you don’t become dehydrated , and they’ll also encourage you to move around as soon as you’re able to. Depending on your risk factors and individual circumstances, a number of different medications can be used to help prevent DVT. For example: anticoagulant medicines – such as dabigatran etexilate or fondaparinux sodium, which are often used to help prevent blood clots after certain types of surgery, including orthopaedic surgery low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) – often used in many cases to help prevent blood clots, including during and shortly after pregnancy unfractionated heparin (UFH) – often used in people with severe kidney impairment or established kidney failure Compression stockings or compression devices are also commonly used to help keep the blood in your legs circulating. Compression stockings are worn around your feet, lower legs and thighs, and fit tightly to encourage your blood to flow more quickly around your body. Compression devices are inflatable and work in the same way as compression stockings, inflating at regular intervals to squeeze your legs and encourage blood flow. Your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly after you’ve been prescribed compression stockings. Keeping mobile can help prevent the ","During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up the leg and can be detected by X-ray , which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood. ","Complications of deep vein thrombosis Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and develop breathlessness and chest pain. Read more about the complications of DVT chemotherapy and radiotherapy being pregnant – your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy being overweight or obese The combined contraceptive pill Heparin and warfarin A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they’ve been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects. you’re having an operation that takes longer than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the operation is on your leg, hip or abdomen you’re having an operation for an inflammatory or abdominal condition, such as appendicitis you’re confined to a bed, unable to walk, or spending a large part of the day in a bed or chair for at least three days You may also be at increased risk of DVT if you’re much less active than usual because of an operation or serious injury and have other DVT risk factors, such as a family history of the condition. Blood vessel damage If the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, it may become narrowed or blocked, which can cause a blood clot to form. Blood vessels can be damaged by injuries such as broken bones or severe muscle damage. Sometimes, blood vessel damage that occurs during surgery can cause a blood clot, particularly in operations on the lower half of your body. Conditions such as vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), varicose veins and some forms of medication, such as chemotherapy , can also damage blood vessels. Medical and genetic conditions radiotherapy can increase this risk further heart disease and lung disease infectious conditions, such as hepatitis inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis thrombophilia – a genetic condition where your blood has an increased tendency to clot If you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you’ll need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulation Anticoagulant medicines prevent blood clots getting bigger. They can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism). Although they’re often referred to as “blood-thinning” medicines, anticoagulants don’t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily. Heparin Heparin is available in 2 different forms: standard (unfractioned) heparin low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) Standard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as: an intravenous injection – an injection straight into one of your veins an intravenous infusion – where a continuous drip of heparin (via a pump) is fed through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm (this must be done in hospital) a subcutaneous injection – an injection under your skin LMWH is usually given as a subcutaneous injection. The dose of standard (unfractionated) heparin to treat a blood clot varies significantly from person to person, so the dosage must be carefully monitored and adjusted if necessary. You may need to stay in hospital for 5 to 10 days and have frequent blood tests to ensure you receive the right dose. LMWH works differently from standard heparin. It contains small molecules, which means its effects are more reliable and you won’t have to stay in hospital and be monitored. Both standard heparin and LMWH can cause side effects, including: a skin rash and other allergic reactions bleeding weakening of the bones if taken for a long time (although rare with LMWH) As with standard heparin, the effects of warfarin vary from person to person. You’ll need to be closely monitored by having frequent blood tests to ensure you’re taking the right dosage. When you first start taking warfarin, you may need to have 2 to 3 blood tests a week until your regular dose is decided. After this, you should only need to have a blood test every 4 weeks at an anticoagulant outpatient clinic. Warfarin can be affected by your diet, any other medicines you’re taking, and by how well your liver is working. If you’re taking warfarin you should: keep your diet consistent limit the amount of alcohol you drink (no more than 14 units of alcohol a week) take your dose of warfarin at the same time every day not start to take any other medicine without checking with your GP, pharmacist or anticoagulant specialist not take herbal medicines Rivaroxaban Rivaroxaban comes in tablet form. It’s a type of anticoagulant known as a directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It prevents blood clots forming by inhibiting a substance called factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin (an enzyme that helps blood clot). Read the NICE guidance about rivaroxaban Apixaban Like rivaroxaban, apixaban is a DOAC that’s taken orally as a tablet, and prevents blood clots forming by hindering factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin. Read the NICE guidance about apixaban Compression stockings Wearing compression stockings helps prevent calf pain and swelling, and lowers the risk of ulcers developing after having DVT. They can also help prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. This is damage to leg tissue caused by the increase in venous pressure that occurs when a vein is blocked by a clot and blood is diverted to the outer veins. IVC filters are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They trap large fragments of a blood clot and stop it travelling to the heart and lungs. They can be used to help prevent blood clots developing in the legs of people diagnosed with: DVT pulmonary embolism multiple severe injuries IVCs can be placed in the vein permanently, or newer types of filters can be placed temporarily and removed after the risk of a blood clot has decreased. The procedure to insert an IVC filter is carried out using a local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numb). A small cut is made in the skin and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin area. The catheter is guided using an ultrasound scan . The IVC filter is then inserted through the catheter and into the vein. Complications of deep vein thrombosis The 2 main complications of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. Pulmonary embolism A pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of DVT. It happens when a piece of blood clot (DVT) breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to your lungs, where it blocks one of the blood vessels. In severe cases this can be fatal. When you leave hospital You may need to continue to take anticoagulant medicine and wear compression stockings when you leave hospital. Lifestyle changes You can reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle, such as: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet getting regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you’re obese Travelling See your GP before long-distance travel if you’re at risk of getting a DVT, or if you’ve had a DVT in the past. If you’re planning a long-distance plane, train or car journey (journeys of six hours or more), make sure you: drink plenty of water avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol because it can cause dehydration avoid taking sleeping pills because they can cause immobility perform simple leg exercises, such as regularly flexing your ankles take occasional short walks when possible – for example, during refuelling stopovers wear elastic compression stockings Read more about preventing DVT when you travel Travel insurance If you’re travelling abroad, it’s very important to ensure you’re prepared should you or a family member fall ill. Make sure you have full travel insurance to cover the cost of any healthcare you may need while abroad. This is particularly important if you have a pre-existing medical condition, such as cancer or heart disease , which may increase your risk of developing DVT. ","About deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg. Blood clots that develop in a vein are also known as venous thrombosis. DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. It can also occur in the pelvis or abdomen. It can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you’re there. If you’re at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital. These include temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you’re in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings. When you leave hospital, your care team may also make some recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet taking regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you’re obese There’s no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT. See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you’re at risk of getting a DVT, or if you’ve had a DVT in the past. When taking a long-distance journey (6 hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT. Drink plenty of water, perform simple leg exercises and take regular, short walking breaks.

However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity . Obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it’s more common in older people. Read more about living with type 2 diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year by the national diabetes retinal screening service. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated. Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. Read more about diabetic eye screening Gestational diabetes (in pregnancy) During pregnancy, all women need to make more insulin. In some women this doesn’t happen and blood glucose levels rise – typically in the middle of pregnancy onwards. Diabetes diagnosed in pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes. Risk of gestational diabetes is increased with the same risk factors for type 2 diabetes (increased weight, at risk ethnicity and family history of diabetes), but also if you have given birth to a baby in the past who was bigger than expected. For most women with gestational diabetes, blood glucose levels will return to normal after pregnancy. Although you will have an increased risk of developing diabetes in later life. If you’re worried about gestational diabetes then discuss this with your midwife. Blood glucose control is also very important for women with diabetes before pregnancy (type 1, type 2 or other kinds). If you’re planning a pregnancy or are in the early stages of pregnancy, it’s important to discuss this with your GP, midwife or hospital clinic. Other types of diabetes In addition to Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes, there are a range of other types of diabetes. These types of diabetes are much rarer, with about 2% of people having them. The rare types of diabetes include: different types of monogenic diabetes cystic fibrosis-related diabetes diabetes caused by rare syndromes diabetes caused by certain medications such as steroids and antipsychotics diabetes caused by surgery or hormonal imbalances ","There are two main types of diabetes – type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. There are 4.7 million people living with diabetes in the UK. That’s more than one in 15 people in the UK who has diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed). This figure has nearly trebled since 1996, when there were 1.4 million. By 2025, it is estimated that 5 million people will have diabetes in the UK. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood glucose levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as prediabetes. If your blood glucose level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it’s broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there’s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn’t work properly. Type 1 diabetes In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body’s organs. Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years. Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes. If you’re diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you’ll need insulin injections for the rest of your life. You’ll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. For example, you’ll need to eat healthily , take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests. Read more about living with type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. ",,For more information on the other types of diabetes visit Diabetes UK and Diabetes Genes . ,

You can try the self-help measures or ask your pharmacist for advice. Things you can try yourself take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – always read the medicine information leaflet beforehand to check whether you can take it, and check with your pharmacist if you’re not sure drink plenty of water – it’s been suggested this may help flush the infection out of your bladder and some people find it helpful, although it’s not clear how effective it actually is use a hot water bottle – holding a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs may reduce any discomfort don’t have sex until you’re feeling better, because it may make the condition worse These products are also not suitable for everyone. Check with your GP or pharmacist before trying them if you’re taking any other medication. Antibiotics In some cases, your GP may prescribe a course of antibiotics. This will usually involve taking a tablet or capsule 2 to 4 times a day for 3 days. Continuous antibiotics are taken for several months to prevent further episodes of cystitis. These may be prescribed: if cystitis usually occurs after having sex – you may be given a prescription for antibiotics to take within 2 hours of having sex if cystitis is not related to having sex – you may be given a low-dose antibiotic to take for a trial period of 6 months Your doctor may also recommend some measures you can take to prevent cystitis, although it’s not clear how effective these are. ","Most cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body). It’s not always clear how this happens, but it can be caused by: having sex wiping your bottom after going to the toilet – particularly if you wipe from back to front inserting a tampon or urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder) using a diaphragm for contraception Women may get cystitis more often than men because their anus (back passage) is closer to their urethra, and their urethra is much shorter, which means bacteria may be able to get into the bladder more easily. Read more about the Cystitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it sometimes happens when the bladder is irritated or damaged for another reason. Bacterial infections Most infections are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) and start to multiply. Cystitis is much more common in women than men, probably because the anus (back passage) is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is much shorter. It’s not always obvious how the bacteria get into the bladder, but it can be caused by: having sex wiping your bottom after going to the toilet – particularly if you wipe from back to front inserting a tampon or urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder) using a diaphragm for contraception What can increase your risk? There are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing an infection in your bladder. Not being able to empty your bladder If you’re unable to empty your bladder fully, any bacteria that get inside may not be flushed out when you go to the toilet and can multiply more easily. You may not be able to empty your bladder fully if: you have a blockage in your urinary system, such as a bladder stone you’re pregnant, as the baby may be pressing on your bladder (in men) you have an enlarged prostate gland that presses on the urethra Menopause For women who have been through the menopause , or are going through it, the lining of the urethra can shrink and become thinner because of a lack of the hormone oestrogen. The natural balance of bacteria in the vagina may also change, which can allow potentially harmful bacteria to become more common. This can make the urethra more vulnerable to infection, which could spread into the bladder. Diabetes You’re more likely to get cystitis if you have diabetes – a condition where the level of sugar in your body becomes too high. High levels of sugar in your urine can provide a good environment for bacteria to multiply, so any bacteria that get into the bladder are more likely to cause cystitis. Cystitis can also be caused by damage or irritation to the urethra and bladder. This can be the result of: friction from sex chemical irritants, such as those in perfumed soap or bubble bath damage caused by a catheter or surgery on your bladder radiotherapy ",,"About cystitis Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bladder infection. It’s a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI) , particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days. There’s also a chance that cystitis could lead to a more serious kidney infection Preventing cystitis If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back.

Dehydration,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/dehydration/,About dehydration ,"If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 24 111 extreme thirst feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused not passing urine for eight hours rapid heartbeat dizziness when you stand up that doesn’t go away after a few seconds You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids. Two early signs of dehydration are thirst and dark-coloured urine. This is the body’s way of trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss. dizziness or light-headedness headache tiredness dry mouth , lips and eyes passing small amounts of urine infrequently (less than three or four times a day) Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina. It’s a main cause of heat exhaustion. You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage by drinking more fluids. If dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of kidney stones . It can also lead to muscle damage and constipation . When to see your GP You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. If dehydration is suspected, you may be given a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Severe dehydration If dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 24 111 feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused, and you think you may be dehydrated dizziness when you stand up that doesn’t go away after a few seconds not passing urine for eight hours a weak pulse a rapid pulse fits (seizures) a low level of conciousness , or not know how to recognise and treat them. Alcohol Dehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much alcohol . Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more. The headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. You should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol. Diabetes If you have diabetes, you’re at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. Your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently. Read more about the different types of diabetes Who’s at risk? The groups of people most at risk of dehydration are: babies and infants – their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people – they may be less aware they’re becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids people with a long-term health condition – such as diabetes or alcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods Hyponatremia It’s possible to become overhydrated while exercising. This is known as hyponatremia and it’s caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. It can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time. Hyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water. ). ","Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration. You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever. Read more about the Who is at risk from dehydration? Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: babies and infants – they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people – they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids people with a long-term health condition – such as diabetes or alcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods What to do If you’re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. If you’re finding it difficult to keep water down because you’re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently. Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. Read more about Dehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea. The severity of dehydration can depend on a number of factors, such as climate, level of physical activity and diet. Illness Dehydration is often the result of an illness, such as gastroenteritis , where fluid is lost through persistent bouts of diarrhoea and vomiting. Sweating You can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions. In these situations, it’s important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. It doesn’t necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating. Children and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore the ",,"Preventing dehydration About dehydration Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: feeling thirsty and lightheaded a dry mouth tiredness having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine passing urine less often than usual A baby may be dehydrated if they: have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head have few or no tears when they cry have fewer wet nappies are drowsy The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid. Read more about the When to see your GP Dehydration in babies A baby may be dehydrated if they have: a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head few or no tears when they cry a dry mouth fewer wet nappies dark yellow urine drowsiness fast breathing cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet Read about how to treat dehydration in babies The best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice. A sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt. Babies Give your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently. Don’t dilute your baby’s formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water. Avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse. Giving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ORS) in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars. Infants and children Infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ORS (see below). If you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently. You may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid. Read more about vomiting in adults and vomiting in children and babies Oral rehydration solutions When you’re dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Drinking a rehydration solution will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. The solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch. There are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child. Severe dehydration Seek immediate medical help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (see Fluid may be given up the nose using a nasogastric tube or using a saline drip into a vein (intravenously). This will provide essential nutrients faster than using solutions that you drink. If you have had bowel surgery, some rehydration solutions may not contain enough salt. In this instance, you will need a higher-strength solution. Your GP or surgeon can recommend a suitable rehydration solution for you. Preventing dehydration You should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Most of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Be guided by your thirst, but be aware that in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more. Mild dehydration can be relieved by drinking more water and diluted fruit squash. If necessary, you can purchase oral rehydration solutions (ORS) from a pharmacy. As a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (wee) is a good sign that you’re well hydrated. Drink regularly If you’re active, or if the weather is particularly hot, there’s a greater risk that you will become dehydrated. To prevent becoming dehydrated, you should increase your fluid intake. As different people sweat at different rates, it’s very difficult to provide specific recommendations about how much fluid you should drink. However, you should drink more than normal while exercising, and it’s particularly important to keep well hydrated if you’re exercising in warm conditions. This is because you will sweat more and fluid will be lost from your body more rapidly. Rarely, drinking more fluid than your body can process can reduce the amount of sodium (salt) in your blood. This can lead to a serious and potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia. If you start to feel discomfort and bloating from drinking, stop drinking and allow time to recover. Illness If you, your child or someone you are caring for is ill, particularly with a fever, vomiting or diarrhoea , there’s a high risk of becoming dehydrated, so it’s important to start replacing fluid as soon as possible. Advice for children There are no specific recommendations regarding the amount of water or other fluids that children need. However, it’s important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. Like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active. You should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overall healthy, balanced diet . ",

","Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with Parkinson’s disease , build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement. It’s not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it’s thought they disrupt the brain’s normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another.

How many people have dermatitis herpetiformis? DH affects around 1 in 10,000 people. DH can appear at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in those between the ages of 15 and 40. It’s more common in men than women and is rare in children. ","People with DH can have: red, raised patches often with blisters that burst with scratching severe itching and often stinging The rash can affect any area of the skin but is most commonly seen on the: elbows knees buttocks The rash usually occurs on both sides of the body, for example on both elbows. Dermatitis herpetiformis often affects the knees. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ diarrhoea constipation stomach pain bloating The drug most likely to be used is called Dapsone. Dapsone Dapsone is taken in tablet form and must be swallowed. It helps ease the itching and controls the development of blisters. It should work within a few days. If you stop taking Dapsone before the gluten-free diet has taken effect, the rash will return. Side effects of Dapsone The most common side effect of Dapsone is anaemia . Less common side effects are headaches and depression , while nerve damage is rare. You’ll always be prescribed the lowest effective dose to help prevent these side effects. DH should be monitored once the drug dose has been reduced. Alternatives to Dapsone Some people can’t tolerate Dapsone.

What happens during a skin biopsy test? During a skin biopsy test, a specialist skin doctor called a dermatologist will take a small sample of skin from an area without the rash. Samples of skin taken from the area with the rash don’t always give an accurate result. The skin sample is then tested. If you test positive for DH you’ll be referred to a specialist gut doctor called a gastroenterologist to be tested for coeliac disease.

The term “dizziness” means different things to different people – some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning. Because the symptom is quite vague and can be caused by a wide range of things, it may not always be easy to identify the underlying cause. ","hearing loss or tinnitus If you’re taking prescription medicine, your GP will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect. If necessary, they can prescribe a different medication for you to try. You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and investigations. ","When to seek help with dizziness Speak to your GP if you: are feeling lightheaded or off balance have fainting episodes experience headaches Your GP will want to establish exactly what you mean by dizziness, and check that you’re not actually describing vertigo – a severe type of dizziness, where you feel your surroundings are spinning or moving. They’ll also want to know: whether the dizziness started for no apparent reason, or if it followed an illness whether you have repeated episodes of dizziness and, if so, when you tend to experience these how long the dizziness lasts If feeling dizzy occurs when you’re upright its probably not related to the ear. If it happens when you’re lying down, its usually caused by a viral ear infection, which can’t be treated with antibiotics . It’s a good idea to keep a diary recording when and where you feel dizzy and take it with you to your GP appointment. It’s helpful to note: what you were doing at the time you felt dizzy how long it lasted and how bad it was labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection that affects your hearing and balance, and can lead to a severe form of dizziness called vertigo migraine – dizziness may come on before or after the headache, or even without the headache stress or anxiety – particularly if you tend to hyperventilate (breathe abnormally quickly when resting) low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) – which is usually seen in people with diabetes postural hypotension – a sudden fall in blood pressure when you suddenly sit or stand up, which goes away after lying down.

Seeing a doctor about depression Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is: mild depression – it has some impact on daily life moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day psychotic depression . continuous sadness or low mood losing interest in things losing motivation not getting any enjoyment in life feeling tearful feeling guilty feeling anxious feeling irritable finding it hard to make decisions feeling intolerant of other people feeling helpless feeling hopeless low self-esteem feeling worried thinking about suicide thinking about harming yourself speaking or moving slower than usual aches and pains that can’t be explained losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight constipation loss of interest in sex disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early) loss of energy changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period) avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends taking part in fewer social activities neglecting interests and hobbies doing poorly at work difficulties with your family or home life Depression and grief Depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they’re different in many important ways. Depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss. If you’re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it’s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future. People with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don’t get enjoyment from anything. Learn more about the differences between grief and depression here . Different types of depression There are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include: Bipolar disorder Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also called “winter depression”. It’s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally. Postnatal depression happens to some women after they’ve had a baby. It’s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy. Learn more about how depression is diagnosed here . Depression and drugs and alcohol “Drowning your sorrows” is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. Alcohol is categorised as a “strong depressant” which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life. There’s evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax. you have thoughts of self-harm or suicide your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood underactive thyroid . When you see your GP, they’ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you’re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically. Your conversation with your GP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) If your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you’ll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cipramil (citalopram). They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a “good mood” chemical. SSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects. They can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time. Some SSRIs aren’t suitable for children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they’re taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) This group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression. TCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs. They work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood. They’re generally quite safe, but it’s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly. Side effects of TCAs may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person. The side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication. Other antidepressants New antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine) and Zispin Soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs. Venlafaxine and duloxetine are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though they’re not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure. upset stomach anxiety dizziness vivid dreams at night sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks In most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor). If you take St John’s Wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. St John’s Wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy. You shouldn’t take St John’s Wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can’t be certain that it’s safe. Smoking, drugs, alcohol and depression It might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse. If you have depression it’s especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. Research has shown there’s a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use. According to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression: you feel less interested in things you’re more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression you’re less likely to recover fully from depression you feel more tired you won’t respond as well to antidepressants you’re more likely to stop taking antidepressants You can get advice and support from your GP on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.

Finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. If the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you. Depression and suicide The majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression. Warning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are: making final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends talking about death or suicide – this may be with direct statements, like “I wish I was dead”, but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: “I think dead people must be happier than us” or “wouldn’t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up” self-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decision If you’re feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your GP as soon as possible.

Over-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication. Also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach. ​Psychotic depression Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression. People who have severe clinical depression feel sad and hopeless for most of the day, and feel no interest in anything. They feel this way practically every day, and getting through the day feels nearly impossible for them. fatigue (exhaustion) losing pleasure in things inability to concentrate difficulty making decisions sleep disturbance appetite changes feeling guilty feeling that they’re worthless having thoughts about suicide, or death here . Moments of psychosis are known as psychotic episodes. The person experiencing a psychotic episode will have: Delusions – beliefs or thoughts that are likely to be false. Hallucinations – hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren’t there. Hearing voices is a common type of hallucination. Hallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. They may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something. People with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. People experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time. The opposite symptom can also happen – psychomotor retardation can cause a person’s thoughts and the movement of their body to slow down. People who have psychotic depression are at a higher risk of thinking about suicide. psychological therapies – cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy done one-to-one with a trained counsellor, and it has succeeded in helping some people with psychosis social support – support with social needs like employment, education and accommodation take them to the nearest A&E, if they agree phone their GP phone the local out-of-hours GP phone 999 and ask for an ambulance Advice and support Visit the SANE website or the Mind website for more information, support and advice about psychotic depression.

Depression doesn’t have one single cause – it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries. Different reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you’re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression. It’s common to hear about depression being brought on by a “downward spiral” – one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression. There are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There’s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult. Depression and illness Long-lasting or life-threatening conditions like cancer or coronary heart disease can put you at higher risk of developing depression. Many people don’t know that head injuries can cause depression, and a severe head injury can lead to emotional problems and mood swings. There are a number of things that can lead to developing depression. Stressful events – big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. When these things happen, it’s important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone – this increases your risk of developing depression. Giving birth – pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. Postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby. Loneliness – your risk of depression gets higher if you aren’t in contact or spending time with family and friends. Personality – some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. These include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. These personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life. Family history – it’s more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before. Big, stressful events like divorce, serious illness, financial worries, or bereavement can trigger depression for some people. Severe depression can run in families, which suggests genes might play a role in depression, but the reason some people develop psychosis as part of severe depression is not known. Many people who have psychotic depression have experienced a difficult time in childhood, like a traumatic event.

Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time. While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it’s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious. Do I have depression? There’s no physical test for depression. You may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you’d rather not talk to your GP. There are a number of talking therapies for depression. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) CBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it’s recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now. You can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts – this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example. Most people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT. Computerised CBT (CCBT) This type of CBT is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. It should be supported by a healthcare professional – your GP may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the GP surgery to access it. CCBT involves a series of weekly sessions. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) IPT is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. These can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement. There’s evidence that suggests IPT can be as effective for depression as CBT or medication, but more research needs to be done. Psychodynamic psychotherapy This is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. You’ll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you’re thinking. This helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression. Read more about psychotherapy here . Counselling Counselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that’s currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness. On the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential. A counsellor helps you to think about what’s going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They’ll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don’t tell you what to do. Antidepressants Antidepressants Side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other. St John’s Wort When receiving ECT, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. Electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical “shock” to your brain. ECT is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks. ECT can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems. Most people find that ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed. Lithium There are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you’re taking one that works for you, it’s best not to change. If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You’ll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you’re on the medication. You’ll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet. ​Living with depression There’s a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better. Talking about depression You can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. According to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress. medication – taking a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants Getting help for someone with psychotic depression Often friends, relatives, or carers have to seek help for a person with psychotic depression. This is because people with psychosis often don’t know they’re acting and thinking strangely. If you’re worried about someone you know and think they may be experiencing psychosis, and they’ve been diagnosed with a mental health condition before, contact their community mental health team or social worker. If they’ve never shown signs of a mental health condition and you think they may be experiencing psychotic depression, contact their GP or take them to Accident and Emergency (A&E).

Additional medication can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe. Read more about These include: emollients – to use all the time soap substitutes – to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products topical corticosteroids – for flare-ups oral corticosteroids – for severe flare-ups antibiotics – for infected eczema antihistamines – for severe itching There are many different preparations for each type of medication and it is worth taking time with your pharmacist to find the best one for you. A range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See your GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation.

Don’t share emollients with other people. Side effects Occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP, who can recommend an alternative product. Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath. Topical corticosteroids To treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation. Side effects Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause: thinning of the skin changes in skin colour acne (spots) increased hair growth Corticosteroid tablets If you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week. If corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as: reduced growth rate in children high blood pressure (hypertension) osteoporosis (brittle bones) diabetes For this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist. Antibiotics If your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic. Oral antibiotics If you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin. Topical antibiotics If you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. This means the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream. Some topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids. Topical antibiotics should normally be used for up to 2 weeks as necessary. Antihistamines Antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep.

The patches can be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in size and can affect any part of the body, although they don’t usually affect the face or scalp. The patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time. The patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur. Read more about the The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought to be triggered by irritation of the skin. Discoid eczema tends to affect adults and is rare in children. It is more common among men aged from 50 to 70 and women in their teens or twenties. Some people with discoid eczema may also have other types of eczema, such as atopic eczema . Read more about the . How discoid eczema is treated The patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the: lower legs forearms trunk (torso) hands feet The face and scalp are not normally affected. The first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm . You may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry. Patches of discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can keeping recurring – often in the same area that was affected previously. Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up. Discoid eczema can occur anywhere on the body, including the ankles. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Signs of an infection Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include: the patches oozing a lot of fluid a yellow crust developing over the patches the skin around the patches becoming red, hot, swollen, and tender or painful feeling sick chills a general sense of feeling unwell When to seek medical advice The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin. Dry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin. It’s important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema. Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema , which often occurs in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever . However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families. Other possible triggers An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an insect bite or a burn . Some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking: interferon and ribavirin – when they are used together to treat hepatitis C tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers – which are used to treat some types of arthritis statins (cholesterol-lowering medication), which can cause dry skin and rashes ",,"About discoid eczema emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry topical corticosteroids . You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected, as you may need to use antibiotic cream or, in very severe cases, take antibiotics tablets. Read more about diagnosing discoid eczema . If you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your GP. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection. Emollients Choice of emollient Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed. If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product. How to use emollients Choice of topical corticosteroid There are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema. You might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups. How to use topical corticosteroids Do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people will only have to apply it once a day. To apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps: apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin apply a good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your GP phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation bandaging – where medicated dressings are applied to your skin immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system ",
Dysphagia (swallowing problems),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/dysphagia-swallowing-problems/,About dysphagia ,"You should see your GP if you have swallowing difficulties. whether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both whether you’ve lost weight Specialist referral Depending on the suspected cause, you may be referred for further tests with: an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist a speech and language therapist (SLT) a neurologist – a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. This is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach. It can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. However, the effects only last for around 6 months. Surgery Other cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery. Endoscopic dilatation Endoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. It can also be used to stretch your oesophagus if it’s scarred. Endoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy) using an endoscopy. An endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. Using the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. If a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed. You may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. There’s a small risk that the procedure could cause a tear or perforate your oesophagus. Inserting a stent If you have oesophageal cancer that can’t be removed, it’s usually recommended that you have a stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. This is because, if you have cancer, there’s a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it’s stretched. A stent (usually a metal mesh tube) is inserted into your oesophagus during an endoscopy or under X-ray guidance. The stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. You’ll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having blockages.

Congenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include: learning disabilities – where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult cerebral palsy – a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination a cleft lip and palate – a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth Obstruction Conditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach) can make swallowing difficult. mouth cancer or throat cancer, such as laryngeal cancer or oesophageal cancer – once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue pharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as Zenker diverticulum – where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids; it’s a rare condition that mainly affects older people radiotherapy ",,"Complications of dysphagia About dysphagia Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties. Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can’t swallow at all. Other signs of dysphagia include: coughing or choking when eating or drinking bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest persistent drooling of saliva speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent) Read more about diagnosing dysphagia and . Complications of dysphagia Dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the ‘wrong way’ and blocks your airway. If this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead to malnutrition and dehydration . Some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia Dysphagia can also affect your quality of life as it may prevent you enjoying meals and social occasions. Read more about the complications of dysphagia . gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus infections, such as tuberculosis or thrush – these can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis) Muscular conditions Any condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia, although such conditions are rare. 2 muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are: scleroderma – where the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles achalasia – where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomach Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. Breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow. Dysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck surgery. Diagnosing dysphagia Tests will help determine whether your dysphagia is the result of a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or ‘high’ dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or ‘low’ dysphagia). complications of dysphagia , such as choking or pneumonia . Your GP will want to know: how long you’ve had dysphagia a geriatrician – a specialist in the care of elderly people Water swallow test A water swallow test is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and can give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. You’ll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible. The time it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. You may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit. Videofluoroscopy A videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is. An X-ray machine records a continuous moving X-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail. You’ll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on X-rays. A videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. You may feel sick after the test, and the barium may cause constipation . Your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system. Nasoendoscopy A nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope. The endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. It has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. This allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified. FEES can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you’re asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk). Before the procedure, you may have local anaesthetic spray into your nose, but because the camera doesn’t go as far as your throat, it doesn’t cause retching. The procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes. Manometry and 24-hour pH study Manometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. It involves passing a small tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function. The test measures the pressures within your oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it’s working. The 24-hour pH study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach. This can help determine the cause of any swallowing difficulties. Diagnostic gastroscopy Diagnostic gastroscopy, also known as diagnostic endoscopy of the stomach, or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), is an internal examination using an endoscope. The endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. It can often detect cancerous growths or scar tissue. Read more about . Nutritional assessment If dysphagia has affected your ability to eat, you may need a nutritional assessment to check that you’re not lacking nutrients (malnourished) . This could involve: measuring your weight calculating your body mass index (BMI) to check whether you’re a healthy weight for your height carrying out blood tests mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer , can help relieve swallowing problems. High (oropharyngeal) dysphagia High dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat. It can be difficult to treat if it’s caused by a condition that affects the nervous system. This is because these problems can’t usually be corrected using medication or surgery. swallowing therapy dietary changes feeding tubes Swallowing therapy You may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia. An SLT is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties. SLTs use a range of techniques that can be tailored for your specific problem, such as teaching you swallowing exercises. Dietary changes You may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) for advice about changes to your diet to make sure you receive a healthy, balanced diet. An SLT can give you advice about softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. They may also try to ensure you’re getting the support you need at meal times. Feeding tubes Feeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you’re recovering your ability to swallow. They may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk of malnutrition and dehydration . A feeding tube can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions. There are 2 types of feeding tubes: a nasogastric tube – a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube – a tube that is implanted directly into your stomach Nasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. The tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. PEG tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced. Most people with dysphagia prefer to use a PEG tube because it can be hidden under clothing. However, they carry a greater risk of complications compared with nasogastric tubes. Minor complications of PEG tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2 major complications of PEG tubes are infection and internal bleeding. Resuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a PEG tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. The convenience of PEG tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who use nasogastric tubes. Low (oesophageal) dysphagia Low dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the oesophagus. Medication Depending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat indigestion Cerebral palsy Dysphagia caused by cerebral palsy can be treated with speech and language therapy. Your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes. Cleft lip and palate Cleft lip and palate is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. It’s usually treated with surgery. Narrowing of the oesophagus Narrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Dysphagia caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. Sometimes medication may also be used. Breastfeeding or bottle feeding If you’re having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby, see your midwife, health visitor or GP. Complications of dysphagia The main complication of dysphagia is coughing and choking, which can lead to pneumonia. Coughing and choking If you have dysphagia, there’s a risk of food, drink or saliva going down the ‘wrong way’. It can block your airway, making it difficult to breathe and causing you to cough or choke. Read more information and advice about what to do if someone is choking . If you have dysphagia, you may also develop a fear of choking. However, it’s very important you don’t avoid eating and drinking, as it could cause dehydration and malnutrition . If you often choke on your food because of dysphagia, you may also be at an increased risk of developing a condition called aspiration pneumonia . Aspiration pneumonia . In particularly old or frail people, there’s a chance the infection could lead to their lungs becoming filled with fluid, preventing them working properly. This is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Your chances of developing pneumonia as a result of dysphagia are higher if you have a weakened immune system, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , or if your oral and dental hygiene is poor. Dysphagia in children If children with long-term dysphagia aren’t eating enough, they may not get the essential nutrients they need for physical and mental development. Children who have difficulty eating may also find meal times stressful, which may lead to behavioural problems. ",
Diverticular disease and diverticulitis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/diverticular-disease-and-diverticulitis/,About diverticular disease and diverticulitis ,"lower abdominal pain feeling bloated more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements Read more about the . Diverticulosis, diverticular disease and diverticulitis Diverticula ‘Diverticula’ is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine is thought to cause the bulges to form. Read more about the Diverticulitis Diverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to the intestine. Read more about the complications of diverticulitis . paracetamol can be used to relieve pain – other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working. Mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with antibiotics Diverticular disease is often described as a ‘Western disease’ because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries. A combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to eat less fibre. People aged 50 to 70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease – compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre. Diverticulosis If diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means. Diverticular disease The most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side. The pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help relieve the pain. a change in your normal bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhoea , or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like ‘rabbit pellets’ bloating Another possible symptom of diverticular disease is bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is an uncommon complication. Diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP. Diverticulitis a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above a general feeling of being tired and unwell feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) The pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen. In Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons. When to seek medical advice Read more about the a stomach ulcer pancreatitis cholecystitis bowel cancer The exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but they are associated with not eating enough fibre. Fibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body. The pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer (mucosa) to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula. There is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. However, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in Western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre. Diverticular disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and may overlap. However, factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include: smoking being overweight or obese having a history of constipation use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) painkillers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50 Exactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear. Diverticulitis Diverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula. It is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection. Diagnosing diverticular disease and diverticulitis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . As a first step, your GP may recommend blood tests to rule out other conditions such as coeliac disease (a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or bowel cancer . A colonoscopy is not usually painful, but it can feel uncomfortable. You may be offered painkilling medication and a sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help reduce any discomfort. CT pneumocolon or colonography Another technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a computerised tomography (CT scan) . A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. As with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the CT scan. Unlike a regular CT scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to pump some air up into your rectum. The CT scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back. You may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary. Diverticulitis Further tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease. If you are unwell, your GP may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. This is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia. An ultrasound scan may be used, as well as a CT scan. Diverticular disease Most cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home. The over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol Painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding. . If you have constipation , you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system. Heavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in 20 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a blood transfusion . Signs that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include: feeling very dizzy mental confusion pale clammy skin shortness of breath If you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP at once. If this is not possible then phone NHS 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service . Diverticulitis For the 3 to 4 days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. This is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to deal with while it is inflamed. if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to infections If surgery is being considered, discuss both benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care. In an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation. Complications of diverticular disease and diverticulitis Complications of diverticulitis affect 1 in 5 people with the condition. Those most at risk are aged under 50. Bleeding Around 15% of people with diverticular disease or diverticulitis experience bleeding, which is usually painless, quick and resolves itself in 70% to 80% of cases. However, if the bleeding does not resolve itself, an emergency blood transfusion may be required due to excessive bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to be admitted to hospital for monitoring. Urinary problems Diverticulitis can lead to the inflamed part of the bowel being in contact with the bladder. This may cause urinary problems, such as: pain when urinating (dysuria) needing to urinate more often than usual in rare cases, air in the urine Abscess The most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). An abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. Abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD). A radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (CT) scans) uses an ultrasound or CT scanner to locate the site of the abscess. A fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. The tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. A PAD is performed under a local anaesthetic. Depending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all the pus has been drained. If the abscess is very small – usually less than 4cm (1.5 inches) – it may be possible to treat it using antibiotics . Fistula A fistula is another common complication of diverticulitis. Fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2 parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder. If infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. After the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. Fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder ( cystitis ). Fistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula. Peritonitis In rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). An infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis. In some cases, the blocked part can be removed during surgery. However, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanent colostomy may be needed. Preventing diverticular disease and diverticulitis Your diet should be balanced and include at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus whole grains. Adults should aim to eat 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight. It’s recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). Drinking plenty of fluids will also help prevent side effects. Sources of fibre Good sources of fibre include fruit vegetables nuts breakfast cereals – but check fibre content as some are very low starchy foods – such as brown bread, rice and pasta Once you have reached your fibre target, stick to it for the rest of your life, if possible. Fresh fruit Good sources of fibre in fresh fruit (plus the amount of fibre that is found in typical portions) include: avocado pear – a medium-sized avocado pear contains 4.9g of fibre pear (with skin) – a medium-sized pear contains 3.7g of fibre orange – a medium-sized orange contains 2.7g of fibre apple (with skin) – a medium-sized apple contains 2g of fibre raspberries – 2 handfuls of raspberries (80g) contain 2g of fibre banana – a medium-sized banana contains 1.7g of fibre tomato juice – 1 small glass of tomato juice (200ml) contains 1.2g of fibre Dried fruit Good sources of fibre in dried fruit (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include: apricots – 3 whole apricots contain 5g of fibre prunes – 3 whole prunes contain 4.6g of fibre Vegetables Good sources of fibre in vegetables (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include: baked beans (in tomato sauce) – a half can of baked beans (200g) contains 7.4g of fibre red kidney beans (boiled) – 3 tablespoons of red kidney beans contain 5.4g of fibre peas (boiled) – 3 heaped tablespoons of peas contain 3.6g of fibre French beans (boiled) – 4 heaped tablespoons of French beans contain 3.3g of fibre Brussel sprouts (boiled) – 8 Brussel sprouts contain 2.5g of fibre potatoes (old, boiled) – 1 medium-sized potato contains 2.4g of fibre spring greens (boiled) – 4 heaped tablespoons of Spring greens contain 2.1g of fibre carrots (boiled, sliced) – 3 heaped tablespoons of carrots contain 2g of fibre Nuts Good sources of fibre in nuts (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include: almonds – 20 almonds contain 2.4g of fibre peanuts (plain) – a tablespoon of peanuts contains 1.6g of fibre mixed nuts – a tablespoon of mixed nuts contains 1.5g of fibre Brazil nuts – 10 Brazil nuts contain 1.4g of fibre Breakfast cereals Good sources of fibre in breakfast cereals (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include: All-Bran – a medium-sized bowl of All-Bran contains 9.8g of fibre Shredded Wheat – 2 pieces of Shredded wheat contain 4.3g of fibre Bran Flakes – 1 medium-sized bowl of Bran flakes contains 3.9g of fibre Weetabix – 2 Weetabix contain 3.6g of fibre muesli (no added sugar) – 1 medium-sized bowl of muesli contains 3.4g of fibre porridge (milk or water) – 1 medium-sized bowl of porridge contains 2.3g of fibre Note – the ‘own-brand’ equivalents of the cereals mentioned should contain similar levels of fibre. Starchy foods Good sources of fibre in starchy food (plus the amount found in typical portions) include: crispbread – 4 crispbreads contain 4.2g of fibre pitta bread (wholemeal) – 1 piece (75g) contains 3.9g of fibre pasta (plain, fresh-cooked) – 1 medium portion of pasta (200g) contains 3.8g of fibre wholemeal bread – 2 slices of wholemeal bread contain 3.5g of fibre naan bread – 1 piece of naan bread contains 3.2g of fibre brown bread – 2 slices of brown bread contain 2.5g of fibre brown rice (boiled) – 1 medium portion of brown rice (200g) contains 1.6g of fibre Fibre supplements – usually in the form of sachets of powder you mix with water – are also available from pharmacists and health food shops. Some contain sweetener. A tablespoon of fibre supplement contains around 2.5g of fibre. If you require long-term fibre supplements, your GP can prescribe them. ","Diagnosing diverticular disease and diverticulitis . It’s estimated that 5% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old. Diverticular disease Colectomy Surgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your large intestine. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2 ways this operation can be performed: an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your large intestine laparoscopic colectomy – a type of ‘keyhole surgery’ where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of large intestine ",,"Complications of diverticular disease and diverticulitis Preventing diverticular disease and diverticulitis About diverticular disease and diverticulitis Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon). In diverticular disease, small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets become inflamed or infected. A high-fibre diet Surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare. Read more about . Who is affected Diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions. . Colonoscopy Mild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe antibiotics for the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain. It’s important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better. Some types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting and diarrhoea . If you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if: your pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol you are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated you are unable to take antibiotics by mouth your general state of health is poor you have a weakened immune system your GP suspects complications Surgery In the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2 episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications. This is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits. However, there are exceptions to this, such as: if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis Emergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in a stoma being formed. Stoma surgery (‘having a bag’) In some cases, the surgeon may decide your large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible. In such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your large intestine. It is known as ‘having a bag’ as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag. Stoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen – known as a stoma. There are 2 ways this procedure can be carried out. An ileostomy – where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. Your small intestine is separated from your large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the large intestine is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo). A colostomy – where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material. In most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your large intestine has recovered from the surgery. This will depend on the situation when you had the operation. If it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma. If a large section of your large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy. Results of surgery colostomy . Intestinal obstruction If the infection has badly scarred your large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. A totally blocked large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your large intestine will start to decay and eventually split, leading to peritonitis. ",
Dystonia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/dystonia/,"Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder. People with dystonia experience involuntary muscle spasms and contractions. Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) is often associated with some types of dystonia. Dystonia can be a condition on its own (primary dystonia). Some people experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition (secondary dystonia). ","uncontrolled muscle spasms parts of your body twisting into unusual positions – like your neck being pulled to the side or your feet turning inwards shaking (tremors) excessive blinking Types of dystonia There are different types of dystonia. Generalised dystonia Generalised dystonia affects all parts of the body. Focal dystonia If you have focal dystonia, only one muscle group is affected. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) ","Other types of focal dystonia can impact: your voice (laryngeal dystonia) the muscles around your eyes (blepharospasm) limbs (like writer’s cramp) Dystonia is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls movement. Primary dystonia often begins in childhood. This type of dystonia is more likely to have a recognised genetic cause. You might experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition. Secondary dystonia might be caused by: Parkinson’s disease cerebral palsy certain medications (like some antipsychotics and some anti sickness medications) injury to the brain stroke Diagnosing dystonia If your GP thinks you have dystonia, they may refer you to a specialist neurologist. You may need to have tests to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia. ",,"Botulinum toxin If you have focal dystonia, you might be offered botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin is injected into the affected muscles. It blocks the neurotransmitters within the nerve, reducing muscle spasms. The effects of the injection can last from around 3 months to 6 months. Medication Oral medications, like tablets, can be effective for some people with generalised dystonia. The following are medications which might be used to treat dystonia: anticholinergics baclofen muscle relaxants Physiotherapy Depending on the type of dystonia you have, physiotherapy might help you improve your range of movement. Surgery The surgeon will place a small device, like a pacemaker, under the skin of your chest or tummy.

It can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy. ,"A build-up of earwax in your ear can cause: earache hearing loss tinnitus (hearing sounds from inside your body) itchiness in or around the ear ear infections These problems will usually get better once the build up of earwax has been removed. What to do if you think your ear is blocked Do not try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down. Try eardrops There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing: sodium bicarbonate olive oil almond oil Eardrops aren’t suitable for everyone and some can irritate the skin. You shouldn’t use eardrops if you have a hole or tear in your eardrum. Speak to your pharmacist about the right product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it. Find your nearest pharmacy Speak to your GP practice if: eardrops haven’t helped after 1 week Diagnosing earwax build up Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they’re blocked. They might carry out some simple hearing tests. ","Some people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax. producing naturally hard or dry earwax having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum) being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal Earwax can also block your ear if you often insert objects into your ear, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or hearing aids.

Dry mouth,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/dry-mouth/,It’s normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if you’re dehydrated or feeling nervous. A persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem though. Contact your dentist or GP if: You have a dry mouth and: ,"What problems can a dry mouth cause? Saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience some other problems, such as: a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth dry lips bad breath (halitosis) a reduced or altered sense of taste mouth infections that keep coming back, such as oral thrush tooth decay and gum disease difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing It’s important to maintain good oral hygiene if you have a dry mouth. This can reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on. Do drink plenty of cold water – take regular sips during the day and keep some water by your bed at night suck on ice cubes or ice lollies sip on cold unsweetened drinks chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free sweets use lip balm if your lips are also dry brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash – you’re more likely to get tooth decay if you have a dry mouth Don’t do not drink lots of alcohol, caffeine (such as tea and coffee) or fizzy drinks do not eat foods that are acidic (like lemons), spicy, salty or sugary do not smoke do not sleep with dentures in do not use acidic artificial saliva products if you have your own teeth Saliva substitutes and stimulants If the measures above don’t help, your dentist, GP or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute. An artificial saliva substitute will help keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals. If your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or Sjögren’s syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day. It helps to stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva. ",radiotherapy to the head and neck – this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis) Sjögren’s syndrome – a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glands ,,"you have difficulty chewing, swallowing or talking you’re struggling to eat regularly you’re having problems with your sense of taste that are not going away your mouth is painful, red, swollen or bleeding you have sore white patches in your mouth you think a prescribed medicine might be causing your dry mouth What can cause a dry mouth? A dry mouth can happen when the salivary glands in your mouth do not produce enough saliva. This is often the result of dehydration . This means you do not have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It’s also common for your mouth to become dry if you’re feeling anxious or nervous. A dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as: medication – many different medications can cause a dry mouth including antidepressants , antihistamines and diuretics a blocked nose – breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out diabetes nasal decongestants for a blocked nose insulin for diabetes Things to try yourself ",
Down’s syndrome,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/downs-syndrome/,"A baby with Down’s syndrome is born with more of chromosome 21 in some or all of the cells that make up their DNA. It’s also known as Trisomy 21. People with Down’s syndrome may lead active, healthy and independent lives into their 60s, 70s and beyond. Most will have mild to moderate learning disabilities and some may have more complex needs. It cannot be known before birth if a person will need any additional help and support. Living with Down’s syndrome There are increasing opportunities and support in education, work and housing for people with Down’s syndrome. People with Down’s syndrome can live healthy and fulfilling lives as part of their families and communities. Some may: live independently have jobs be in relationships socialise with minimal support. Evidence suggests most families of people with the condition feel satisfied with their lives. Many children with Down’s syndrome attend mainstream school and receive additional support if they need it. Congenital and rare condition register Babies with Down’s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland. The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information. It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services. Read more about CARDRISS Down’s syndrome and health Many children with Down’s syndrome have similar health conditions to all children. Some health conditions can be more common in people with Down’s syndrome, but some are less common. Around half of all children with Down’s syndrome will have heart issues, although fewer than 1 in 5 of those may need surgery. They’re more likely to have muscle tone and digestion issues and may have reduced hearing or vision. However, they’re less likely to develop some cancers and types of heart disease. Regular health checks can make sure any health conditions are picked up early and managed. Down’s syndrome is not a life-limiting condition. People with the condition can lead active, healthy and fairly independent lives into their 60s, 70s and beyond. Screening for Down’s syndrome During your pregnancy you’ll be offered a screening test to detect if your baby might have Down’s syndrome. All pregnant women, no matter what age, can be tested. A blood test and nuchal translucency (NT) scan can be used to screen for this condition.

Cystic fibrosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/cystic-fibrosis/,About cystic fibrosis ,"recurring chest infections difficulty putting on weight frequent, wet-sounding coughs diarrhoea occasional wheezing and shortness of breath People with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including diabetes , thin, weakened bones ( osteoporosis ) and liver problems. Read more about the Cystic fibrosis can cause a range of problems. The lungs and digestive system are the main areas that are affected. screening for cystic fibrosis . The main problems associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below. Lung problems Cystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. This can cause: recurring chest infections – these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria persistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened ( bronchiectasis ) increased coughing occasional wheezing and shortness of breath Over time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly. Digestive system problems The mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which can affect how food travels through the gut and how it’s broken down or absorbed. This can cause: a serious bowel obstruction in the first few days of life (meconium ileus) – this will often need an operation to remove the blockage jaundice diarrhoea or large, smelly stools problems putting on weight and growing – this can occur because the body struggles to digest and absorb nutrients ( malnutrition ) diabetes from late childhood or early adulthood – this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damaged Other problems People with cystic fibrosis can also experience a number of other problems, including: sinusitis nasal polyps thin, weakened bones ( osteoporosis ) – this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition swelling and pain in the joints ( arthritis or arthralgia) from late childhood Tests to find out if you are a ‘carrier’ of the faulty gene responsible for cystic fibrosis may also be recommended for some people. Newborn screening A newborn blood spot test is offered to all babies in Scotland to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis. When your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis. You should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you’ll be asked to attend a hospital appointment. A person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. A care plan will be drawn up that’s tailored to their individual needs. ","Diagnosing cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents. The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways. To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene – one from each of their parents. Their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally. If both parents carry the faulty gene, there’s a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis. Read more about the Screening and testing for cystic fibrosis Most cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the newborn blood spot test . This involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby’s heel and testing it for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis. Read more about how cystic fibrosis is diagnosed Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents. The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways – particularly the lungs and digestive system. The condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it. How cystic fibrosis is inherited Genes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father. To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents. This can happen if the parents are ‘carriers’ of the faulty gene. This means they don’t have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene. If both parents are carriers, there’s a: 25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won’t have cystic fibrosis or be able to pass it on 50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier 25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have cystic fibrosis This is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Diagnosing cystic fibrosis Tests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age. The sweat test is most commonly used, although genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that’s causing the condition. Carrier testing you have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent, who’s a known carrier you have a close relative with cystic fibrosis your partner is known to carry the cystic fibrosis gene This can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. The sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene. Finding out whether you’re a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you’re at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. A genetic counsellor will explain the results of the test to you and discuss the implications and options available for future pregnancies. ","a sweat test – to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal Two main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis: sweat test – a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal ","About cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. It can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. Over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly. Most cases of cystic fibrosis in the UK are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. It’s estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. antibiotics to prevent and treat chest infections medicines to make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up medicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation special techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs medicines that help the person absorb food better following a special diet and taking supplements to prevent malnutrition A lung transplant may eventually be needed if the lungs become greatly damaged. Read more about Outlook for cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time. Eventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly. Currently, about half of the people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this. Information about you If you or your child has cystic fibrosis, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register liver problems caused by the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus leaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits ( stress incontinence ) Medications for lung problems People with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. These may be swallowed, inhaled or injected. Some of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are: antibiotics to prevent and treat chest infections medicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder a medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body – although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis bronchodilators to widen the airways and help make breathing easier steroid medication to treat nasal polyps (small growths inside the nose) It’s also important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with all routine vaccinations and have the flu jab each year once they’re old enough. Airway clearance techniques In addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. A physiotherapist can give you advice. Some of the main techniques include: active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) – a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing autogenic drainage – a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs modified postural drainage – a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs airway clearance devices – handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of £45-60 for one of these devices Your care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above. Dietary and nutritional advice For people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill. However, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they’re a baby. Occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem. A dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoid malnutrition . They may recommend: taking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion – the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person following a special balanced diet that’s high in calories (energy), fat and protein taking vitamin and mineral supplements Lung transplants lung transplant may be recommended. A lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis. The outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they’re often younger and in better general health. It’s estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on lung transplants in cystic fibrosis . For example: exercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with cystic fibrosis – any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you’re not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice medicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn’t get enough vitaminD and calcium (from their diet and/or from supplements) insulin medication and a special diet may help someone with diabetes caused by cystic fibrosis control their blood sugar levels ",

Outer ear infections (infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum) and middle ear infections hearing loss . The condition tends to be painless, but sometimes the pressure of this fluid can cause earache. Glue ear will often clear up on its own, although this can take a few months. If the problem is persistent, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended to help drain the fluid. Read more about glue ear Damage to the ear Earache can sometimes result from injury to the inside of the ear. For example, by scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud, or poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum.

Glue ear Earwax or an object in the ear A build-up of earwax or an object stuck inside the ear can sometimes cause earache. If there is something in your or your child’s ear that seems be causing pain, don’t attempt to remove it yourself. You may push it further inside and you may damage the eardrum. If you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally. In some cases, your GP will organise for removal of the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation. If there is an object in the ear, your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed. Throat infections If you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection such as tonsillitis or quinsy. Quinsy is an abscess on the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow. Some types of tonsillitis will clear up after a few days without the need for antibiotics A problem with your jaw Earache is occasionally caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull). This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can be caused by problems such as arthritis or teeth grinding. Jaw pain can often be treated with painkillers, warm or cold compresses, and trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth. A dental abscess A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in your affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing, although the pain can sometimes spread to your ear.

Epilepsy,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/epilepsy/,"Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures. Epilepsy affects more than 600,000 people in the UK. Almost one in every 100 people has the condition. ","The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely. The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body). Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy. Types of seizures Seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep. The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are: focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures. Focal seizures There are two main types of focal seizure. Focal aware seizures Focal aware seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout. a general strange feeling that is hard to describe a “rising” feeling in your tummy – sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu) experiencing an unusual smell or taste a tingling sensation, or “pins and needles”, in your arms and legs a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand These seizures are sometimes known as “warnings” or “auras”, because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you’re in a safe place. Focal impaired awareness seizures Focal impaired awareness seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness. You won’t remember what happened after this type of seizure. smacking your lips rubbing your hands making random noises moving your arms around picking at clothes fiddling with objects adopting an unusual posture chewing or swallowing During a focal impaired awareness seizure, you’ll not be able to respond to anyone else. You’ll usually have no memory of it. Generalised seizures There are 6 main types of generalised seizure. Absences Absence seizures mainly affect children, but they also occur in adults. They cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. The person will seem to stare vacantly into space. Some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The person will have no memory of the seizure. Absences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child’s performance at school. They can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road. Myoclonic seizures These types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you’ll normally remain conscious during this time. Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. They can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures. Clonic seizures Atonic seizures Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. There’s a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself. Tonic seizures Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. You might lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there’s a risk of injury. Tonic-clonic seizures Tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You’ll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer. This type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit. Myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above. What to do if someone has a seizure If you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure. Phone 999 if: the seizure has not stopped after 5 minutes the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between you know it’s the person’s first seizure the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason the person’s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe If you’re with someone who has a seizure: protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby cushion their head with your hands or soft material do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger) don’t put anything in their mouth stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness When the convulsions have stopped, put them into the recovery position until they’ve recovered. Status epilepticus Diagnosing epilepsy Epilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. In most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure. It can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, like fainting, migraines and panic attacks If you’ve had a seizure, you’ll be referred to a specialist in epilepsy. This will normally be a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system). Describing your seizures Some of the most important pieces of information needed to diagnose epilepsy are the details about your seizures. The doctor will also ask about your medical and personal history. They’ll ask whether you use any medicines, drugs or alcohol. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan An MRI scan is a type of scan which uses strong magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the inside of your body. ","In some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found. If there’s an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition. The brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures. Structural cerebrovascular disease (problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain) – such as a stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage brain tumours severe head injuries Genetic Sometimes epilepsy is hereditary (passed on from one or both parents) or it can be a new gene abnormality. Infectious Infections like meningitis can cause damage to the brain which can result in epilepsy. Viral infections like HIV can also cause epilepsy. Metabolic Sometimes epilepsy is caused by an imbalance of the bodies chemicals. This is very rare. Immune Autoimmune conditions that cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can cause someone to develop epilepsy. Unknown In many cases, no cause of epilepsy is found. This may be because medical investigations are not advanced enough to identify the cause. Seizure triggers For many people with epilepsy, seizures can occur without any obvious trigger. However, certain circumstances or the use of certain substances can sometimes come before a seizure. These include: stress lack of sleep withdrawal from alcohol following heavy drinking some medications illegal drugs your menstrual cycle or period flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger that affects less than 5% of people with epilepsy, and is known as photosensitive epilepsy) Electroencephalogram (EEG) An EEG test can detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. It measures the electrical activity of your brain through electrodes placed on your scalp. During the test, you may be asked to breathe deeply or close your eyes and you may be asked to look at a flashing light. The test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure. In some cases, an EEG may be carried out while you’re asleep (sleep EEG). Or you may be given a small, portable EEG recording device to monitor your brain activity over 24 hours (ambulatory EEG). You might be asked to come into the hospital for a few days to have a video telemetry and EEG. During this, an EEG and video will be used to monitor you. Things that may lead to SUDEP include: having seizures which cause loss of consciousness and the body to go stiff and jerk (tonic-clonic seizures) poorly controlled epilepsy, such as not using ASMs prescribed to control seizures having sudden and frequent changes to ASMs being a young adult (in particular male) having sleep seizures having seizures when alone drinking large amounts of alcohol ",magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . ,"You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. It’s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus. If you’ve been trained to treat the condition, you’ll usually have been advised to use either: a medication called diazepam that’s placed in the person’s rectum (less commonly used) Most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring. There are many different ASMs. They work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. This reduces the chance of a seizure. The type of ASM recommended for you will depend on a number of factors like: the type of seizures you have your age whether there are any concerns about a certain ASM interacting with other medicines (like the contraceptive pill ) whether you’re thinking of having a baby Examples of commonly used ASMs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Taking ASMs ASMs are available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids and syrups. It’s important you follow any advice about when to take ASMs and how much to take. Never suddenly stop taking an ASM because it could cause a seizure. You shouldn’t take any other medicines whilst taking ASMs without speaking to your GP or epilepsy specialist. This includes over-the-counter medicines or complementary medicines such as St John’s Wort. Other medicines could have a dangerous interaction with your ASM and cause a seizure. Sodium valproate is not usually prescribed for women of childbearing age. This is because it could cause a baby to have physical defects or developmental problems. risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy . Speak to your healthcare team for more information on the side effects. Brain surgery This involves having various types of brain scans to find out where the epilepsy is focused. Memory and psychological tests will assess how the surgery might affect you. Surgery is only recommended when: a single area of the brain is causing seizures (focal seizures) removing that part of the brain would not cause any significant loss of brain function Most people recover from the effects of surgery after a few days. But it could be several months before you’re feeling fit and able to return to work. Alternative procedures Your doctor might suggest an alternative procedure if: brain surgery is not suitable for you This might be vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) VNS involves surgically implanting a small electrical device under your skin, near your collarbone. The device is like a pacemaker . The device has a wire that’s wrapped around one of the nerves in the left side of your neck, known as the vagus nerve. The device passes a regular dose of electricity to the nerve to stimulate it. This can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. If you feel the warning sign of a seizure coming on, you can activate an extra “burst” of stimulation. This might prevent the seizure from occurring. The stimulation normally occurs every five minutes and lasts for 30 seconds. How and why VNS works is not fully understood. It’s thought that stimulating the vagus nerve alters the chemical transmissions in the brain. Most people who undergo VNS still need to take ASMs. The battery for the VNS device typically lasts up to 10 years. After 10 years you’ll need another procedure to replace it. Ketogenic diet A ketogenic diet is a diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates and protein. It’s thought that it may make seizures less likely by altering the chemical composition of the brain. A ketogenic diet is sometimes advised for children with seizures that are difficult to control and have not responded to ASMs. This is because it’s reduces the number of seizures in some children. It should only be used under the supervision of an epilepsy specialist with the help of a dietitian. It can also be effective in adults with certain types of epilepsy. Living with epilepsy Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone. They can help prevent many conditions, including heart disease and many forms of cancer . Try to eat a balanced diet, containing all the food groups, to give your body the nutrition it needs. Exercising regularly can increase the strength of your bones, relieve stress and reduce fatigue. Drinking Alcohol can also interact with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs can heighten the effects of alcohol. Alcohol also can make the side effects of ASMs worse and make the medication less effective. Heavy drinking can disrupt your sleep patterns. This increases your chances of having a seizure. Drinking no more than the recommended daily limits may help reduce this risk. Read more about drinking and alcohol Contraception Some anti-seizure medication (ASMs) can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception. This includes: contraceptive injections contraceptive patches the combined oral contraceptive pill – often known as ‘the pill’ the progesterone-only pill (POP) or ‘mini pill’ contraceptive implants If you’re sexually active and do not want to become pregnant, ask your GP or epilepsy specialist if your ASMs could affect your contraception. You may need to ensure you or your partner use another form of contraception like a condom or intrauterine device (IUD) . The effectiveness of the ASM lamotrigine may be reduced if you’re taking the combined oral contraceptive pill. Some ASMs can make the emergency contraceptive pill less effective. If you need emergency contraception, you may need an IUD. Your GP, family planning clinic or pharmacist should be able to help you. Pregnancy There’s no reason why women with epilepsy cannot have a healthy pregnancy. It’s better if the pregnancy is planned because there’s a slightly higher risk of complications. With forward planning, you can minimise these risks. The main risk is that some ASMs increase the chances of a serious birth defect, like spina bifida, cleft lip or congenital heart disease . The risks depend on the type of ASM and the dose you’re taking. The UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register can provide more information and advice about the use of ASMs during pregnancy. If you’re planning a pregnancy, talk to your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to change the ASM you’re taking to minimise risks. Taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of a folic acid supplement each day can also help reduce risks of birth defects. You might be recommended to take more than this by your healthcare team. If you discover you’re pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine. The risks to your baby from uncontrolled seizures are far higher than any risks associated with your medicines. If you’re breastfeeding or planned to breastfeed, discuss the medication you’re taking with your healthcare team or midwife. Children and epilepsy Many children with well-controlled epilepsy can learn and take part in their school’s activities unaffected by their condition. Others may need extra support to get the most out of their time at school. Make sure your child’s teachers know about their condition and the medication they need to control it. Epilepsy is more common among children with learning disabilities and special educational needs. These children are entitled to extra help to overcome their difficulties. Driving You must tell the Driving and Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) if you’ve had any epileptic seizures or blackouts. You must stop driving right away. If you ignore these regulations, you might be prosecuted. The DVLA may wish to contact your GP or epilepsy specialist. The DVLA may issue a licence if your seizures have never caused you to lose awareness or affected your ability to safely control a vehicle. Your GP has a legal responsibility to inform the DVLA if they feel that your driving is putting both you and others at risk. Read about epilepsy and driving on the DVLA website Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) When somebody with epilepsy dies and there’s no clear cause, it’s known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The risk of SUDEP for someone with epilepsy is low. A charity called SUDEP Action can offer advice and support on SUDEP. They have a helpline for people who have lost a loved one as a result of epilepsy. ",
Ewing sarcoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/ewing-sarcoma/,"Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer. The 3 main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old. Sarcomas A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body’s supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas are the 2 main types. Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the: pelvis bone (hips) thigh bone (femur) shin bone (tibia) However, the condition can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone. ","Your GP may refer you for an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist). They may recommend that you have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to examine the area in closer detail. A bone biopsy may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic . The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer . ","Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown. As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones. The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer. Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma. However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the . Diagnosing Ewing sarcoma ",,"Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. Ewing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy . It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning. Surgery If surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on: the size of the tumour where it is in your body whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection. Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed. In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed ( amputation ). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone. For more information about the , visit the Cancer Research UK website. Living with bone cancer The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure. However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement . There are also a number of practical issues you’ll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work. The Cancer Research UK website has more information on coping with bone cancer . Information about you If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register ",

Febrile seizures,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/febrile-seizures/,About febrile seizures ,"What to do during a seizure If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position . Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts. If it’s your child’s first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to the nearest hospital as soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. While it’s unlikely that there’s anything seriously wrong, it’s best to be sure. If your child has had febrile seizures before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or the NHS 24 111 service for advice. Don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth during a seizure because there’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue. Almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure. Read more about diagnosing febrile seizures and your child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period of illness your child doesn’t fully recover from the seizure within one hour Why febrile seizures occur The cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they’re linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above). In most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as: chickenpox flu (influenza) middle ear infections (otitis media) tonsillitis There may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition. Read more about the The main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever. Febrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. However, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever. Simple febrile seizures can happen when there’s a rapid rise in temperature and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit. Alternatively, they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level. During simple febrile seizures: your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch they’ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards Complex febrile seizures Seeking medical advice You should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if: your child is having a fit for the first time the seizure lasts longer than five minutes and shows no signs of stopping you suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for example meningitis your child is having breathing difficulties If your child has previously had febrile seizures, it’s recommended that you telephone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice. You should also contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service if your child shows (a lack of fluid in the body). This includes: a dry mouth sunken eyes a lack of tears when crying a sunken fontanelle – the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child’s head meningitis . A blood or urine sample may be needed to test for signs of infection. It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital. Read more about blood tests Further tests Further testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child is having complex febrile seizures . Your child may have other tests including an electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture, particularly if they’re less than 12 months old. These two tests are explained below. Electroencephalogram An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures your child’s electrical brain activity through electrodes that are placed on their scalp. Unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicate epilepsy . However, some studies have suggested that an EEG may not be useful in many cases of febrile seizures. Lumbar puncture During a lumbar puncture , a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed for testing. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. A hollow needle is inserted into the base of the spine to obtain the CSF sample. During the procedure, local anaesthetic will be used to numb your child’s back so that they don’t feel any pain. A lumbar puncture can be used to determine whether your child has an infection of the brain or nervous system. ","Diagnosing febrile seizures Complications Febrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy , as well as other problems. Recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy. However, this link hasn’t been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance. In addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood. Febrile seizures and epilepsy Many parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they’ll develop epilepsy when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever. While it’s true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small. It’s estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. This is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven’t had febrile seizures. Febrile seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown. Some researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible. One theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily ‘scramble’ the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure. Family history Although febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk. If a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. The more relatives affected, the higher the risk. This is probably the result of one or more genetic mutations that a child inherits from their parents, which makes them more susceptible to seizures. A genetic mutation means the instructions carried in certain genes become ‘scrambled’, resulting in some of the body’s processes not working in the normal way. Associated infections Most febrile seizures occur when a child has a high temperature caused by an infection. The three most common infections associated with febrile convulsions are: viral infections, such as chickenpox and flu middle ear infections (otitis media) tonsillitis Other infections associated with febrile seizures are: urinary tract infections (UTIs) upper respiratory tract infection – an infection of the mouth, nose and throat, and associated tissues and structures gastroenteritis – an infection of the digestive system lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia (a lung infection) and bronchitis (an infection of the airways that supply the lungs) Vaccinations In rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination. Research has shown that your child has a one in 3,000 to 4,000 chance of having a febrile seizure after having the MMR vaccine . The risks are even lower with the DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine – a one in 11,000 to 16,000. Diagnosing febrile seizures Febrile seizures can often be diagnosed from a description of what happened. Further tests may be needed if the cause of the associated infection isn’t clear. It’s unlikely that your doctor will see the seizure, so an account of what happened is useful. It’s useful to know: how long the seizure lasted what happened – body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring and loss of consciousness whether your child recovered within one hour whether they’ve had a seizure before ",,"About febrile seizures A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever. Febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren’t serious. Around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur between the ages of six months and three years. During a febrile seizure, the child’s body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure. Read more about the Types of febrile seizure There are two main types of febrile seizure. Simple febrile seizure A simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. It’s a fit that: is a tonic clonic seizure (see above) lasts less than 15 minutes doesn’t reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness Complex febrile seizure Complex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features: the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes In many cases, febrile seizures do not need to be treated, although care should be taken to deal with a seizure as it happens. What to do during a seizure If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position . Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, and will keep their airway open and help prevent injury. Stay with your child while they’re having a seizure, and make a note of when the seizure started to keep track of how long it lasts. If the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service. If it’s your child’s first seizure, or if it lasts longer than five minutes, take your child to the nearest hospital as soon as possible. While there’s probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it’s best to be sure. Don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth while they’re having a seizure. There’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn’t usually serious and will heal within a few days. Trying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for them. High temperature (fever) Reducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable. Paracetamol and ibuprofen have been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. However, they won’t reduce the chances of your child actually having a seizure. Removing any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child’s temperature. Aspirin should never be given to children under 16 years of age because there’s a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called Reye’s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage. It’s also important to prevent dehydration during a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids. Recurring febrile seizures About one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. This often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure. Recurrence is more likely if: the first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old there’s a history of seizures or epilepsy in your family before having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one hour or their temperature was less than 40C (104F) your child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode ( complex febrile seizure ) your child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the flu or chickenpox ) It’s not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. This is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks of the seizures themselves. Research has shown that the use of medication to control fever isn’t likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. For example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged. In this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever. Children who’ve had a febrile seizure following a routine vaccination (which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who’ve had a seizure due to another cause for fever.

Eye cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/eye-cancer/,"There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including: eye melanoma squamous cell carcinoma lymphoma retinoblastoma – a childhood cancer Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts. This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer.

Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it’s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye. Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected. It can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid. ","Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. It’s not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening: lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you’re more at risk of developing skin cancer and eye melanoma use of sunbeds – there’s some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their fifties. Diagnosing melanoma of the eye If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment. If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they’ll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow. It’s likely you’ll have a number of different tests at the centre, including: an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy) . The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.

Edwards’ syndrome,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/chromosomal-conditions/edwards-syndrome/,"Edwards’ syndrome (also known as trisomy 18) is a genetic condition that begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and continues to impact their health throughout their life. It’s a rare but serious condition. In the UK, around 3 in every 10,000 births are affected by Edwards’ syndrome. What is Edwards’ syndrome? When a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome. Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father. If a baby has Edwards’ syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby. There are 3 different forms of Edwards’ syndrome: Full form In full form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells. Around 94% of babies born with Edwards’ syndrome have the full form of the syndrome. Mosaic form In mosaic form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells. Partial form In partial form Edwards’ syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 18. This is a very rare form of Edwards’ syndrome. Why does Edwards’ syndrome happen? Most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy. Effects of Edwards’ syndrome on pregnancy Screening for Edwards’ syndrome You’ll be offered screening for Edward’s syndrome when you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant. The screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Edwards’ syndrome. If screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has Edwards’ syndrome, you can choose to have a further diagnostic test if you wish. No test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Edward’s syndrome or how they’ll be affected. Risk of miscarriage and stillbirth Around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Edwards’ syndrome from screening tests will end in miscarriage or stillbirth . The risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth. Effects of Edwards’ syndrome on babies If your baby is affected by Edwards’ syndrome, it is likely they will have associated health conditions (other conditions often found in babies with Edwards’ syndrome). Some of these may be serious. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Edwards’ syndrome they have. Babies with full form Edwards’ syndrome Full form Edwards’ syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live. Around 5 in 10 (52.5%) will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (12.3%) will live longer than 5 years. Babies born with full form Edwards’ syndrome will have a learning disability which may be severe. They’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically: around 9 in 10 (90%) will have heart issues around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity) around 1 in 10 (10%) will have a cleft lip and/or palate Babies with mosaic form and partial form Edwards’ syndrome Currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards’ syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on: how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic) how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial) Some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Edwards’ syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all. Many babies with the mosaic form of Edwards’ syndrome will have some form of learning disability and developmental delay (when a child takes longer to start doing certain activities, like walking and talking, than other children their age). The life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards’ syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy. Living with Edwards’ syndrome Each child is unique, and Edwards’ syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they’ll have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are. ",,,,"have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing) Despite their complex needs, children with Edwards’ syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly. Many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school. Feedback from many parents suggests that children with Edwards’ syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family. Congenital and rare condition register Babies with Edwards’ syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland. The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information. It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.

Coma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/coma/,"A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken. It can result from injury to the brain, such as a severe head injury or stroke . A coma can also be caused by severe alcohol poisoning or a brain infection (encephalitis). People with diabetes could fall into a coma if their blood glucose levels suddenly became very low (hypoglycaemia) or very high (hyperglycaemia) . What is a coma? Someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They’re alive, but can’t be woken up and show no signs of being aware. The person’s eyes will be closed and they’ll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won’t normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily. Someone in a coma will also have very reduced basic reflexes such as coughing and swallowing. They may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe. Over time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Caring for and monitoring a person in a coma Doctors assess a person’s level of consciousness using a tool called the Glasgow Coma Scale . This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses three things: eye opening – a score of one means no eye opening, and four means opens eyes spontaneously verbal response to a command – a score of one means no response, and five means alert and talking voluntary movements in response to a command – a score of one means no response, and six means obeys commands Most people in a coma will have a total score of eight or less. A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover. ",,,,"What you can do as a visitor The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don’t. Some people have reported feeling enormous reassurance from the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma. When visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find the advice below helpful: when you arrive, announce who you are talk to them about your day as you normally would – be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard show them your love and support – even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be a great comfort Research has also suggested that stimulating the main senses – touch, hearing, vision and smell – could potentially help a person recover from a coma. As well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume. Recovering from a coma A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. a vegetative state – where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves a minimally conscious state – where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes Some people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all. People who do wake up from a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with. Some people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives. The chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they’ve been in a coma. But it’s impossible to accurately predict whether the person will eventually recover, how long the coma will last and whether they’ll have any long-term problems.

Ewing sarcoma: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/ewing-sarcoma-children/,,"How Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an X-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest X-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope ( biopsy ). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy. An MRI or CT scan may also be done. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. ",side effects ,,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Sarcomas Sarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are 2 main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas. Bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ewing sarcoma Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column). It usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys. Although Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. This is called extraosseous Ewing sarcoma. Another type of Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). These can be found in either the bone or soft tissue. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Surgery If surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. The aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. If the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Amputation Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport. Limb-sparing surgery There are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. It may involve: replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part) replacing the bone with bone taken from another part of the body (a bone graft) After limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. However, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. This may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. It’s often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. If the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it’s a good option. Side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoea Radiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having. Late side effects A small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects. Clinical trials Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/escherichia-coli-e-coli-o157/,"Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called VTEC, is a bacterial infection. It can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure. E. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It’s an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by: eating contaminated food, such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat – a lways wash all vegetables, including salad leaves, that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled ‘ready to eat’ (washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely) touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams ","A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years. Further information about gastroenteritis wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes in a washing machine at the highest temperature possible (for example 60°C) wipe down the outside of the washing machine with hot water and detergent after any heavily soiled load clean toilet seats, toilet flush handles, basin taps, surfaces and toilet door handles at least daily, preferably more often, using hot water and detergent disinfection sprays and wipes or alcohol-based wipes may be used on toilet seats and other surfaces, but only after any visible soiling has been removed thick household bleach is highly effective – dilute one part bleach to every 10 parts water for soiled surfaces and one part bleach to every 100 parts water for other hard surfaces ideally, use heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves and disposable cloths for cleaning dispose of cloths by placing them in a plastic bag, sealing the neck and placing in household waste thoroughly wash rubber gloves in hot water and detergent after use, then rinse and allow to dry deal with any spillage of faeces immediately – clean the soiled area with hot water and detergent using heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves then clean gloves and wash hands thoroughly Don’t do not share towels or nappy changing mats do not clean soiled items in the kitchen Returning to work or school Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better. Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school. If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has. If you have a child under 5 years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery. Children under 5 years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others. ",,,"It’s important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. Contact your GP practice if: you or your child has bloody diarrhoea Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications. Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin. Find out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis . How to prevent E. coli O157 from spreading at home Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected. Do wash your hands thoroughly with soap in running water and dry them completely – use liquid soap and warm water if you can everyone must wash their hands after contact with an infected person, particularly after handling their clothes or bedding always wash your hands after going to the toilet or changing babies’ nappies, and before preparing or serving food or eating meals ",
Erectile dysfunction (impotence),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/erectile-dysfunction-impotence/,About erectile dysfunction ,"Read more about diagnosing erectile dysfunction How is erectile dysfunction treated? Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological. You may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-lowering statins and drugs to reduce your blood pressure. The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse. ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly. Inability to get an erection Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical. Seek medical advice See your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). your overall physical and mental health your alcohol consumption whether you take drugs whether you are currently taking any medication If you do not want to talk to your GP about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can find your nearest GUM clinic on the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) website. Sexual history You’ll also be asked about your sexual history. Try not to be embarrassed because erectile dysfunction is a common problem. You can request a male GP at your surgery if you prefer. You may be asked about: your previous and current sexual relationships what your sexual orientation is how long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction whether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning whether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm your libido (your level of sexual desire) Erectile dysfunction that happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause. Erectile dysfunction that only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause. Assessing your cardiovascular health Your GP may assess your cardiovascular health. Narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart and blood flow). Your GP may: measure your blood pressure to see if you have high blood pressure (hypertension) listen to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities measure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height ask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do test a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vessels Physical examinations and tests enlarged prostate , such as weak or irregular urination, a digital rectal examination (DRE) may be suggested. Blood tests can also check for underlying health conditions. For example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone). Further testing In some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. This might be the case if you are unusually young to be experiencing erectile dysfunction as it’s rare in men under 40 years of age. Intracavernous injection test An intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. This helps assess any abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery. If the injection doesn’t result in an erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. In some cases, you may also need an ultrasound scan . Arteriography and dynamic infusion cavernosometry or cavernosography These specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. These are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels. Psychological assessment If the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered for a psychological assessment. have had a heart attack – a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked Complementary therapies Some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. However, there is little evidence they are useful. In some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects. Always speak to your GP before using any complementary therapies. ","Diagnosing erectile dysfunction narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes hormonal problems surgery or injury anxiety depression relationship problems Sometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines. Read more about the cardiovascular disease It’s important to identify the cause of erectile dysfunction and treat any underlying conditions. Erections When a man becomes sexually excited (aroused), his brain sends signals to the nerves in his penis. The nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden. Anything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to erectile dysfunction. Anything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido) can also cause erectile dysfunction because a reduced libido makes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. Psychological conditions, such as depression , can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body). There are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in erectile dysfunction. These are: conditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis – vasculogenic conditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord – neurogenic conditions affecting your hormone levels – hormonal conditions affecting the physical structure of your penis – anatomical Injuries and surgery Neurogenic conditions Examples of neurogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: multiple sclerosis – a condition that affects the body’s actions, such as movement and balance Parkinson’s disease – a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing a spinal injury or disorder a stroke – a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted Hormonal conditions Examples of hormonal conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: hypogonadism – a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) – where too much thyroid hormone is produced an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – where not enough thyroid hormone is produced Cushing’s syndrome – a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisol Anatomical conditions Peyronie’s disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause erectile dysfunction. Medicine In some men, certain medicines can cause erectile dysfunction, including: diuretics – these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease antihypertensives – such as beta-blockers , that are used to treat high blood pressure fibrates – medicines used to lower cholesterol levels antipsychotics – used to treat some mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia antidepressants –  used to treat depression and some types of pain corticosteroids – medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone H2-antagonists – medicines used to treat stomach ulcers anticonvulsants – used to treat epilepsy antihistamines – used to treat allergic health conditions, such as hay fever anti-androgens – medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones) cytotoxics – medication used in chemotherapy to prevent cancer cells from dividing and growing Speak to your GP if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. Alternative medication may be available. However, it is important never to stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care. depression – feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time anxiety – a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear There are many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. These include: relationship problems lack of sexual knowledge past sexual problems past sexual abuse being in a new relationship excessive alcohol intake tiredness using illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocaine Cycling Men who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction. Riding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction. Diagnosing erectile dysfunction Erectile dysfunction (ED) can often be diagnosed by your GP. They will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination. Your GP may ask you about: Side effects PDE-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including: headaches and migraines flushing (redness) indigestion nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) a blocked or runny nose back pain vision disturbances muscle pain Vacuum pumps A vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated. It may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. After using a vacuum pump, nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ED. Considerations You should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking anticoagulant medicines , which reduce the ability of your blood to clot. Side effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men. ",,"About erectile dysfunction Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection. Erectile dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree. When to see your GP See your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). Find your local GP practice Why does erectile dysfunction happen? Read more about It is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you. Read more about Erectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who experience a severe head injury . Vasculogenic conditions Examples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: cardiovascular disease – a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes – a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. This can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic condition If your erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes If you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. It is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. Lifestyle changes Erectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as: losing weight if you are overweight giving up smoking cutting back your alcohol consumption not taking illegal drugs exercising regularly reducing stress As well as helping to improve your erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels). Read more about preventing cardiovascular disease Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors sildenafil – sold under the brand name Viagra tadalafil – sold under the brand name Cialis vardenafil – sold under the brand name Levitra avanafil – sold under the brand name Spedra Depending on the type of PDE-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. With sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. After taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours. It may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it’s best to take it on an empty stomach. You can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine. Only take one tablet within a 24-hour period. Your GP should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. The choice may depend on: how often you are sexually active whether you have tried any of the medications before There have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. In general, at least two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines. If you do not find that PDE-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because: you have not waited long enough after taking the dose you have waited too long after taking the dose the dose is not high enough you have not had enough sexual stimulation These medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work. Warnings PDE-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in men who have cardiovascular disease , such as coronary heart disease. However, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. You should discuss the risks and benefits with your GP. PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as Peyronie’s disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis). PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who: are at risk of priapism – a painful erection that lasts for several hours are also taking long lasting alpha-blockers – a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) Do not take PDE-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. The combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart. Organic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as ‘poppers’. You are also warned not to take PDE-5 inhibitors if you: have been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels have low blood pressure (hypotension) have recently had a stroke – a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted have unstable angina The Sexual Advice Association produces a number of factsheets, including one on vacuum pumps that provides details of companies that supply them. Alprostadil Alprostadil is available as: an injection directly into your penis – this is called an intracavernosal injection a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis) – this is called urethral application You may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. If your partner is pregnant, use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra. Alprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. How long the erection lasts will depend on the dose. In men who did not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. Alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men. Warnings Alprostadil should not be used: in men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours) – for example, those with sickle cell anaemia alongside other erectile dysfunction medications if you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activity Urethral application may also not be used in: some men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis) men who have infections of their penis, such as balantis (inflammation of the head of the penis) Side effects Alprostadil can cause some side effects including: changes in your blood pressure dizziness headache pain in your penis urethral burning or bleeding reactions at the site of the injection, such as swelling NHS prescriptions Hormone therapy Hormones are chemicals produced by the body. Many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels. Surgery younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area – for example, in a car accident men with a significant anatomical problem with their penis In the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. The surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. However, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it’s unlikely to be used. Penile implants Penile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. These can be: semi-rigid implants – which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly inflatable implants – which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erection Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants may be very expensive. However, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery. Complications As with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted carries a risk of infection. If you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around two or three in 100. Mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in five per cent of cases. If conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from counselling (a talking therapy). Sensate focus Sensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. It starts with you both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. During this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman’s breasts). The idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex. After the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other’s genital areas. You can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. This can build up to include penetrative sex. You can find out more about sensate focus from the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT) . Psychosexual counselling Psychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction. By talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your erectile dysfunction. Psychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have erectile dysfunction. CBT is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. CBT helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. It is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it. Your CBT therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction – for example, to do with: your self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself) your sexuality your personal relationships Your CBT therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues. Pelvic floor muscle exercises Some studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. These are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis. Pelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. If your GP feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly. ",

Feeling of something in your throat (Globus),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/feeling-of-something-in-your-throat-globus/,"Globus is a symptom that can make you feel like you have a lump in your throat. It is also called ‘globus sensation’. Globus can be caused by many things, such as an increased tension of muscles or irritation in the throat. ","Different people describe it differently. It may be felt as: tightness or a pressure in your throat catarrh/mucus that you are unable to clear an area of discomfort in your throat a feeling of something stuck or a lump in your throat If you feel something sticking in your throat, but can eat and drink normally and without pain, you do not need to worry. Eating and drinking Try to drink at least 1.5 litres (3 pints) of water every day. You should drink in small sips as swallowing helps to relax the throat. Avoid too much alcohol, tea, coffee and fizzy drinks. They can cause the throat to be dry. Try to reduce the amount of fatty and spicy food in your diet. Leave at least 3 hours between your last meal and going to bed. Avoid snacking between your last meal and bedtime. Consider trying anti-reflux medication (your pharmacist can advise). Smoking Your pharmacist or GP can offer support if you would like advice. Further information on stopping smoking Throat clearing Try not to clear your throat as this can make your globus sensation worse. You can try sipping water, instead. Losing weight Losing any excess weight . Reducing stress Stress can increase your globus sensation. If you think you might be stressed, try to relax in a way that is doable for you and your situation. Breathing and relaxation exercises can sometimes help, but if you feel you need further help with managing stress, your GP can discuss this with you. Further information about relieving stress When to see your GP There are no specific tests to diagnose globus. Further investigations are not required, so you don’t usually need to see a GP.

The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that’s located underneath the liver. It’s main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it’s stored.

Do ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not always effective disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated – it’s best to use a bleach-based household cleaner wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area practice good food hygiene: make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date Don’t do not rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not always effective don’t share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they’re 2 to 3 months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis. ","It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by norovirus (the ‘winter vomiting bug’) or bacterial food poisoning . Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you’re feeling better. Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Phone 111 or your GP if you’re concerned or need any advice. ",,,
Fungal nail infection,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/fungal-nail-infection/,"Many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. It’s not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat. ","As it progresses, the infection can cause: discolouration of the nail – it may turn white, black, yellow or green thickening and distortion of the nail – it may become an unusual shape or texture and be difficult to trim pain or discomfort – particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger brittle or crumbly nails – pieces may break off and come away completely Sometimes the skin nearby may also become: infected itchy cracked red swollen ","Toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails. The medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis. A fungal nail infection can cause the nail to become thick, yellow and brittle. https://dermnetnz.org/ Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete’s foot infecting the nails. These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet. You’re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you: don’t keep your feet clean and dry wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, like communal showers, locker rooms and gyms have damaged your nails have a weakened immune system have certain other health conditions, like diabetes , psoriasis or peripheral arterial disease Fungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this if you have an infection. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if: you’re bothered by the appearance of a nail with a fungal nail infection the fungal nail infection is causing problems like pain or discomfort ",,"can take a long time can cause side effects isn’t always effective For more severe or troublesome fungal nail infections, antifungal medication may be recommended. Antifungal medication Antifungal medication comes in tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail. Antifungal tablets Terbinafine and itraconazole are the 2 medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections. These usually need to be taken once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. If you stop taking the medication too early, the infection may return. Possible side effects of antifungal tablets can include: headache itching diarrhoea loss of sense of taste a rash Antifungal tablets are currently not licensed to be sold over the counter. This is because these tablets have many listed side effects, contraindications and need to be taken for several months. Antifungal nail paint If you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your GP or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead. Nail paint isn’t generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. However, it doesn’t usually cause any side effects. Like antifungal tablets, antifungal nail paint also normally needs to be used for several months to ensure that the infection has cleared up. Softening and scraping away the nail wash the affected area and dry it thoroughly carefully apply the paste to the infected nails cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail repeat this process each day for 2 to 3 weeks Once no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over the next few months. Removing the nail If your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. However, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely. How to prevent fungal nail infections Do keep your hands and feet clean and dry wear well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks – these will allow your feet to “breathe” clip your nails to keep them short – don’t share clippers or scissors with other people replace old footwear that could be contaminated with fungi treat athlete’s foot as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails ensure your towels are washed regularly make sure any equipment is properly sterilised between uses if you visit a nail salon Don’t do not share towels and socks with other people do not walk around barefoot in public pools, showers, and locker rooms – special shower shoes are available to protect your feet ",

Gallstones,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/gallstones/,About gallstones ,"However, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder ( cholecystitis ), which can cause: persistent pain jaundice a fever complications of gallstones The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It’s passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder. The bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed. You’re more at risk of developing gallstones if you’re: overweight or obese female, particularly if you’ve had children 40 or over (the risk increases as you get older) Read more about: abdominal pain complications – such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis In these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. This procedure, known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy , is relatively simple to perform and has a low risk of complications. You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than build up in the gallbladder. Read more about: Abdominal pain (biliary colic) Gallstones can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1 to 5 hours (although it can sometimes last just a few minutes). The pain can be felt: in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) just under the ribs on your right-hand side – it may spread from here to your side or shoulder blade The pain is constant and isn’t relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick. It’s sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but may occur at any time of day and it may wake you up during the night. Biliary colic doesn’t happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode. Some people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit. When gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as ‘uncomplicated gallstone disease’. In a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel). If this happens, you may develop: a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above more persistent pain a rapid heartbeat yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) itchy skin diarrhoea chills or shivering attacks confusion a loss of appetite Doctors refer to this more severe condition as ‘complicated gallstone disease’. Read more about the complications of gallstones . When to seek medical advice If you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP. Contact your GP immediately for advice if you develop: jaundice abdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours a high temperature and chills abdominal pain so intense that you can’t find a position to relieve it If it’s not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours or NHS 24’s 111 service. If you do have , make an appointment with your GP so they can try to identify the problem. Seeing your GP Ultrasound scan Gallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body. The type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen. Sound waves are sent from the transducer, through your skin and into your body. They bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image on a monitor. This is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. When gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct. Gallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan. If they’re not visible but your tests suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an MRI scan or a cholangiography. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. Cholangiography A procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder. A cholangiography uses a dye that shows up on X-rays . The dye may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an endoscope passed through your mouth. After the dye has been introduced, X-ray images are taken. They’ll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. If your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it’s meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder). If a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove it at this point using an endoscope. This is known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). See Keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder If surgery is recommended, you’ll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3 or 4 small cuts are made in your abdomen. One larger cut (about 2cm to 3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen. Your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs. A laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor. Your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments. If it’s thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can’t be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery. After the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings. Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually performed under a general anaesthetic , which means you’ll be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. The operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same day. Full recovery typically takes around 10 days. Single-incision keyhole surgery Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. During this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you’ll only have one barely visible scar. However, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven’t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. Access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Open surgery A laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you: are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy are extremely overweight have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous In these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. During this procedure, a 10cm to 15cm (4in to 6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed. This is done under general anaesthetic, so you’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain. pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours) a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above a rapid heartbeat An estimated 1 in 7 people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below). Acute cholecystitis is usually treated first with antibiotics to settle the infection and then keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder . This operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there’s a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure. Sometimes a severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). Antibiotics alone don’t always treat these and they may need to be drained. Occasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder can tear, leading to peritonitis (inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen). If this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged. Read more about acute cholecystitis . Jaundice If a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs. yellowing of the skin and eyes dark brown urine pale stools itching Sometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. If it doesn’t, the stone needs to be removed. See pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade a high temperature jaundice chills confusion itchy skin generally feeling unwell Antibiotics will help treat the infection, but it’s also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).

Gallstone ileus Another rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. This is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone. Gallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. Gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel. abdominal pain being sick swelling of the abdomen constipation ","Diagnosing gallstones Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones. preventing gallstones Gallstones are thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion. It’s still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if: there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4 in every 5 gallstones are made up of cholesterol) there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1 in every 5 gallstones is made up of bilirubin) These chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble. Sometimes only 1 stone will form, but there are often several at the same time. Who’s at risk? Gallstones are more common if you: are female, particularly if you’ve had children, are taking the combined Pill, or are undergoing high-dose oestrogen therapy are overweight or obese are aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones) have a condition that affects the flow of bile – such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, or obstetric cholestasis have Crohn’s disease or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a close family member who’s also had gallstones have recently lost weight (from either dieting or weight-loss surgery) are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone Diagnosing gallstones Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) An endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. The gallbladder isn’t removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above. ERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see diagnosing gallstones for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine. However, during ERCP the opening of the bile duct is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body. Sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass. An ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you’ll be awake throughout the procedure but won’t experience any pain. The ERCP procedure lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour. You may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored. Medication to dissolve gallstones If your gallstones are small and don’t contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid tablets to dissolve them. However, these aren’t prescribed very often because: they’re rarely very effective they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2 years) ",,"Complications of gallstones Preventing gallstones About gallstones diagnosing gallstones Outlook Most cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery. Very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK. Your GP may also recommend having blood tests to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally. If gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to function properly. Further tests for more information about ERCP. CT scan A computerised tomography (CT) scan may be carried out to look for any complications of gallstones, such as acute pancreatitis . This type of scan involves taking a series of X-rays from many different angles. CT scans are often done in an emergency to diagnose severe abdominal pain. scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) high blood pressure inside the liver – this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of alcohol-related liver disease diabetes gallbladder cancer in later life. Side effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Sexually active women should use either a barrier method of contraception , such as a condom , or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills. Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it’s thought you’re at risk of developing them. For example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you’ve recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow. Complications of gallstones A small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system. Inflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis) In some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. This can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed. . Infection of the bile ducts (acute cholangitis) If the bile ducts become blocked, they’re vulnerable to infection by bacteria. The medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis. for more information. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis may develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed. The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach. The pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. The ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain. This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given: fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids) pain relief nutritional support oxygen through tubes into your nose Read more about acute pancreatitis . Cancer of the gallbladder Gallbladder cancer is a rare but serious complication of gallstones. An estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year. Having a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer. Approximately 4 out of every 5 people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones. However, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer. If you suspect you have an obstructed bowel, contact your GP as soon as possible. If this isn’t possible, phone the NHS 24 111 service . Surgery is usually required to remove the gallstone and unblock the bowel. The type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred. Preventing gallstones From the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you’re overweight) may help prevent gallstones. Diet Because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods with a high saturated fat content. Foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter, ghee and lard cream hard cheeses cakes and biscuits food containing coconut or palm oil A healthy, balanced diet is recommended. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and wholegrains. There’s also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones. Drinking small amounts of alcohol may also help reduce your risk of gallstones. However, you shouldn’t regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week as this can lead to liver problems and other health conditions. Regularly drinking any amount of alcohol can increase the risk to your health. Read more about: high cholesterol how to lower your cholesterol healthy eating Losing weight Being overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise. However, avoid low-calorie, rapid-weight-loss diets. There’s evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is recommended.

The 2014 to 2015 outbreak of Ebola mainly affected 3 countries in west Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of central Africa. Around 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization . This was the largest known outbreak of Ebola. Is Ebola still a risk? There’s still a small chance occasional cases of Ebola may occur in Africa as the virus is present in several countries there, but the risk for people travelling to Africa is minimal.

How Ebola virus is spread The Ebola virus is spread in the blood, body fluids or organs of a person or animal with the infection. For example, it can be spread by: for Ebola Any area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care. Dehydration is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person’s body fights the infection. Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment. Ebola virus disease is sometimes fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they’ll survive. Preventing Ebola Follow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections.

The endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. The procedure is usually carried out while you’re awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax. The camera can show if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn’t happen to everyone with GORD. Barium swallow or barium meal A barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus. You are first given some barium solution, then some X-rays are taken. Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system. You’ll be asked not to eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body. Manometry Manometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus. During the procedure, a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus. 24-hour pH monitoring Blood tests Sometimes a blood test may be carried out to check for anaemia , which can be a sign of internal bleeding. eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day – don’t eat or drink alcohol within 3 or 4 hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening try to relax – stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning relaxation techniques may help if you’re often feeling stressed maintain a healthy weight – if you’re overweight, losing weight stop smoking Different medicines may be available, but don’t stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first. Medication Over-the-counter medicines Over-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are: antacids – these neutralise the effects of stomach acid alginates – these produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists – see below for more information about these These medicines aren’t suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you’re not sure. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) The possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches, diarrhoea or constipation , feeling sick, abdominal pain , dizziness and a rash. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) Like PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a rash and tiredness. Surgery and procedures Surgery may be an option if: However, there’s a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). Your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy every few years to check for this. Oesophageal cancer It’s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer within 10 to 20 years. difficulty swallowing unexplained weight loss persistent indigestion hoarseness a persistent cough and/or coughing blood vomiting Surgery to remove the cancer can be carried out if it’s diagnosed at an early stage. Read more about ","Diagnosing GORD . oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus) bad breath bloating and belching feeling or being sick pain when swallowing and/or difficulty swallowing Read more about the Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is usually caused by the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus (gullet) becoming weakened. Normally, this ring of muscle opens to let food into your stomach and closes to stop stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus. Who’s most at risk of GORD? The following factors may increase your risk of developing GORD: being overweight or obese – this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus eating large amounts of fatty foods – the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus smoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate – these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus pregnancy – temporary changes in hormone levels and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause GORD hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy) gastroparesis – when the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid, which means excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus ","The acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that’s passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist. ","Complications of GORD About gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet). It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the for more information. . Complications of GORD If you have GORD for a long time, stomach acid can damage your oesophagus and cause further problems. These include: ulcers (sores) on the oesophagus – these may bleed and make swallowing painful the oesophagus becoming scarred and narrowed – this can make swallowing difficult and may require an operation to correct it changes in the cells lining the oesophagus (Barrett’s oesophagus) – very occasionally, oesophageal cancer can develop from these cells, so you may need to be closely monitored Read more about the complications of GORD . . When tests may be needed You’ll usually only need to be referred for tests in hospital if: your GP is unsure whether you have GORD Heartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines. If these don’t help, your GP can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option. Self-help you don’t want to take medication on a long-term basis The main procedure used is called a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). Alternative techniques have been developed more recently, although these aren’t yet widely available. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) LNF is a type of laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. This means it’s carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin. The procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus, which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It’s carried out in hospital under general anaesthetic . Most people need to stay in hospital for 2 or 3 days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks. For the first 6 weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF, but these should get better with time. Newer operations and procedures The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says these procedures appear to be safe, but not much is known about their long-term effects. These techniques include: Endoscopic injection of bulking agents – where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. Endoluminal gastroplication – where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open. Endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants – where implants containing special gel are placed into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation – where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower. Laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX) – where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing. Speak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information. Complications of GORD A number of possible complications can occur as a result of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for a long time. Oesophageal ulcers The stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with GORD can damage the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form. These ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow. Medications used to treat GORD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. Read more about . Scarred and narrow oesophagus Repeated damage to the oesophagus by stomach acid can also cause it to become scarred and narrowed. This is known as oesophageal stricture and it can make swallowing difficult and painful. If this happens, a procedure to widen the oesophagus using a small balloon or other widening device may be recommended. Barrett’s oesophagus Repeated episodes of GORD can sometimes lead to changes in the cells in the lining of your lower oesophagus. This is known as Barrett’s oesophagus. It’s estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett’s oesophagus, usually after many years. . ",
Genital warts,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/genital-warts/,Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). They are caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). ,"It can take a few weeks or months for genital warts to appear after becoming infected. Genital warts are usually small, rough lumps on the skin. They can appear: around the vagina and on the penis around the anus on the skin between the genitals and the anus Genital warts may: appear on their own or in a group (groups of warts can look like a cauliflower) feel soft or firm be white, red, skin-coloured, or darker than the surrounding skin When to get medical advice Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if you have: 1 or more painless lumps or growths around your vagina, penis or anus itching or bleeding from your genitals or anus a sexual partner (s) who has genital warts Testing for genital warts The test for genital warts involves an examination of the genital area.

Genital herpes,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/genital-herpes/,Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are 2 different types of the virus. Both of which affect the genitals. ,"Once you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If this happens, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a ‘recurrent episode’ of genital herpes. This first episode of genital herpes may last from 2 to 4 weeks. Repeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode. spots or red bumps around the genital area pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus vaginal discharge pain peeing or being unable to pee fever mild swelling of the lymph glands in the groin, armpits and neck a tingling or burning sensation before blisters appear painful red blisters, which soon burst to leave ulcers pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus When to get medical advice Speak to your GP practice or midwife if: you’re pregnant and think you have genital herpes Testing for genital herpes If you think you might have genital herpes, get tested for free by: contacting your GP practice for an appointment booking an appointment at your local sexual health service Some people experience recurrences of genital herpes. In these cases, a longer course of tablets should stop any recurrent episodes. How genital herpes are passed on You can get genital herpes: from skin to skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex) when there are no visible sores or blisters if a cold sore touches your genitals or face kissing (if the person has a cold sore on their face) by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes This risk goes down during the first months after you catch herpes and is not likely after two years. However, it is more common when people are still having frequent recurrences. How to prevent genital herpes The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex . This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. If your partner has herpes, avoiding sex when they have visible sores reduces your risk of getting herpes.

Read more about the However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it’s unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed Your GP may also recommend a blood test How glandular fever is treated These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Read more about a high temperature (fever) a sore throat – this is usually more painful than any you may have had before swollen glands in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits fatigue (extreme tiredness) Glandular fever can also cause: a general sense of feeling unwell aching muscles chills sweats loss of appetite pain around or behind your eyes swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing the inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth a rash swelling or ‘puffiness’ around your eyes a tender or swollen tummy jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) How the condition progresses When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain Read more about EBV carriers Some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. Fluids Drink plenty of fluids (preferably water or unsweetened fruit juice) to avoid dehydration . Avoid alcohol, as this could harm your liver, which may already be weakened from the infection. Painkillers Painkillers available over the counter, such as paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen , can help reduce pain and fever. Children under 16 years old should not take aspirin because there is a small risk it could trigger a rare but serious health condition called Reye’s syndrome. Regularly gargling with a solution of warm, salty water may also help relieve your sore throat . Rest Take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it may make the fatigue last longer. You should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably. Preventing the spread of infection There is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever as most people will already be immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). You can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. There’s little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils. It’s also important to thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered. Antibiotics and steroids Antibiotics headaches and joint pain. Adopting a gradual exercise plan to rebuild your strength and energy levels may help prevent and reduce prolonged fatigue. Reduction in blood cells In a few cases, glandular fever can lead to a reduction in some blood cells. It can reduce levels of: red blood cells (anaemia) – this can make you feel tired and out of breath white blood cells (neutropenia) – this can make you more prone to developing a secondary infection platelets – this can make you bruise and bleed more easily Ruptured spleen Around half of people who develop glandular fever will have a swollen spleen. This does not present any immediate health problems, but there is a small risk of it rupturing (bursting). The main sign of a ruptured spleen is sharp pain in the left of the tummy (abdomen). Go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you develop intense abdominal pain. The risk of the spleen rupturing is small, occurring in just 1 in every 500 to 1,000 cases of glandular fever, but it can be life threatening because it may cause severe internal bleeding. In some cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove an enlarged or ruptured spleen (splenectomy). A ruptured spleen usually occurs as a result of damage caused by vigorous physical activities, such as contact sports. Be particularly careful during the second and third week of your illness, as this is when the spleen is most vulnerable. Neurological complications In less than 1 in every 100 cases, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can affect the nervous system and trigger a range of neurological complications, including: Bell’s palsy – where the muscles on one side of the face become temporarily weak or paralysed viral meningitis – an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord; although unpleasant, viral meningitis is much less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is life threatening encephalitis – an infection of the brain ","Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing – glandular fever is often referred to as the ‘kissing disease’ exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery . Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is most often spread through the saliva of someone who carries the infection. For example, it can be spread through: kissing – glandular fever is sometimes referred to as the ‘kissing disease’ sharing food and drinks sharing toothbrushes exposure to coughs and sneezes Small children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus. When you come into contact with infected saliva, the virus can infect the cells on the lining of your throat. The infection is then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system. This is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body. ",,"Complications of glandular fever About glandular fever Glandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults. It’s also known as infectious mononucleosis, or ‘mono’. . Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever . blood tests .

Complications of glandular fever Most people with glandular fever will recover in 2 or 3 weeks and won’t experience any further problems. However, complications can develop in a few cases. Prolonged fatigue More than 1 in every 10 people with glandular fever will experience prolonged fatigue, which lasts for 6 months or more after the initial infection. It’s not known why fatigue lasts longer in some people. Some experts think it may be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) Secondary infection In a small number of cases, the initial infection weakens your immune system and allows bacteria to infect parts of the body. This is called a secondary bacterial infection. Possible secondary infections that can develop during glandular fever include serious conditions such as pneumonia (infection of the lung) and pericarditis (infection of the sac that surrounds the heart). Secondary infections usually occur in people who have a very weak immune system, such as people with HIV or AIDS , or those having chemotherapy . ",

Infection usually occurs in the genitals but can affect the throat, eyes and anus. ","green or yellow fluid coming out of the penis pain or a burning sensation when peeing discomfort and swelling of the testicles increased discharge from the vagina pain in the lower tummy, particularly during sex bleeding in between periods or after sex Having the infection during pregnancy can result in giving birth to the baby early (premature birth). Gonorrhoea can be passed on to the baby during birth and can result in eye infections in the infant. When to get medical advice Speak to your GP practice or midwife if: you’re pregnant and think you have gonorrhoea Testing for gonorrhoea If you think you might have gonorrhoea, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service ordering a home test kit Services available may vary depending on where you live. What does a gonorrhoea test involve? The test for gonorrhoea is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself. The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are: using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat. Some sexual health clinics may be able to carry out rapid tests and give you your test results straight away. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait up to 2 weeks to get the results. ",,,"Antibiotics will treat the gonorrhoea infection. These can be given in pill form or as an injection. Some strains of gonorrhoea are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This can make it more difficult to treat. You may be tested again 3 weeks later to check the antibiotics have worked. Tell the doctor or nurse if you: are pregnant think you might be pregnant are breastfeeding This may make a difference to the antibiotic you’re prescribed. If your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners. If gonorrhoea is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women. If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility. How gonorrhoea is passed on Gonorrhoea is passed through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom). It can also be passed on by: sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye it can also be passed to a newborn during childbirth Reducing the risk of gonorrhoea The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex .

Gout,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/gout/,About gout ,"Diagnosing gout Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers. severe pain in one or more joints the joint feeling hot and very tender swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year. Read more about the . When to see your GP See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever). If you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you’ve been prescribed (see below) doesn’t start working within a couple of days. Read more about diagnosing gout . corticosteroids prevent further attacks – through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication that lowers uric acid levels, such as allopurinol The main symptom of gout is a sudden attack of severe pain in one or more joints, typically your big toe. the joint feeling hot and very tender, to the point of being unable to bear anything touching it swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint peeling, itchy and flaky skin as the swelling goes down The intense pain can make getting around difficult. Even the light pressure of a bed cover or blanket can be unbearable. Which joints can be affected? Gout can affect almost any joint and can occur in more than one joint at the same time. The joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the: toes – particularly the big toe joint midfoot (where your shoelaces sit) ankles knees fingers wrists elbows If gout is left untreated, it’s likely to affect more joints over time. Attacks of gout tend to: occur at night, although they can happen at any time develop quickly over a few hours Seeing your GP See your GP if you experience for the first time. They may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood. Further tests Allopurinol is a tablet taken once a day. When you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. Regular blood tests will be needed to monitor this until the most effective dose is found. Side effects of febuxostat can include: diarrhoea feeling sick headaches a rash Other medications Less commonly used ULT medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone. These types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. They need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist. Lifestyle changes Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including: avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract. avoiding sugary drinks and snacks – these are associated with an increased risk of gout maintaining a healthy weight – follow a balanced diet ; don’t crash diet or try high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets taking regular exercise – try activities that don’t put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming drinking plenty of water – keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints cutting down on alcohol – avoid beer and spirits in particular and don’t binge drink There’s some evidence to suggest that taking regular vitamin C supplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you’re thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren’t suitable or safe for everyone. Complications of gout Complications of gout can include small lumps forming under the skin (tophi), joint damage and kidney stones. These are more likely to occur if gout is left untreated. Tophi Gout is caused by a chemical called uric acid forming small crystals in and around the joints. These crystals also often build up under the skin and form small white or yellow lumps known as tophi. Tophi are usually painless, but they can form in awkward places, such as at the ends of your fingers and around your toes. Sometimes they can make everyday tasks such as preparing food or getting dressed difficult. They can also can become inflamed and produce a toothpaste-like discharge. Tophi can develop anywhere in the body, but usually form on the: toes heels knees fingers ears forearms elbows It normally takes several years after the first attack of gout for tophi to develop, but some people develop them even before experiencing an attack. They’re usually a sign of severe gout and a good reason to start ","It’s estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK are affected by gout. The condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause . Overall, gout is more common in men than women. Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don’t filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful. Things that may increase your chances of getting gout include: obesity , high blood pressure and/or diabetes having a close relative with gout kidney problems eating foods that cause a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood drinking too much beer or spirits Read more about the . Gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling. These crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in the body. Uric acid Uric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines. If your kidneys don’t filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals. These crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. If they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling). What can increase your risk? A high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However, it’s still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don’t. Other factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below. Medical conditions Some underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including: high blood pressure diabetes kidney disease high levels of fat and cholesterol in your blood obesity metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) psoriasis osteoarthritis Medication Certain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. These include: diuretics (water tablets) – used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body certain medicines used to treat high blood pressure – including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors low-dose aspirin – used to reduce the risk of blood clots niacin – used to treat high cholesterol ciclosporin – used to treat conditions such as psoriasis some chemotherapy medicines Diet Uric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. Eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout. Foods naturally high in purines include: red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork seafood – especially shellfish and oily fish offal – such as liver, kidneys and heart Alcohol Alcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood. Beer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. Moderate consumption of wine – one or two glasses a day – shouldn’t significantly increase your risk of gout. Sugary drinks Certain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout. Some research has found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many fruits) had an increased risk of gout. Family history Studies have shown that gout often runs in families. Around one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition. depression or anxiety . ","Joint fluid test A sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint. The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout, and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis. Blood test A blood test known as a serum uric acid test may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. A high level or uric acid is often associated with gout. It’s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. This is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints. X-ray An X-ray is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn’t usually detectable using this method. However, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that’s increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals deep in the skin that aren’t obvious during a physical examination. ","Complications of gout About gout Read more about . Can gout cause further problems? Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it’s left untreated. These can include: kidney stones small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi permanent joint damage Read more about the complications of gout . What’s pseudogout? come back – you may experience attacks every few months or years become more frequent over time if not treated It’s difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen. When to seek medical advice See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed. Contact your GP immediately or call the 111 service if you have both: severe, worsening joint pain and swelling a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above This could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis). If you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you’ve been prescribed doesn’t start working within a couple of days. Read more about diagnosing gout and . Diagnosing gout Pain relief for a gout attack What to do during an attack You should: take any medication you’ve been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) – this should start to have an effect within two or three days rest and raise the limb avoid knocking or damaging the affected joint keep the joint cool – remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel ensure you’re well hydrated Apply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don’t apply ice directly to your skin and don’t apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin. If necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first. NSAIDs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib. If you’ve been prescribed NSAIDs, it’s a good idea to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards. Your GP may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to take alongside your NSAID. This reduces the risk of the NSAID causing indigestion , stomach ulcers and bleeding from the stomach. Colchicine If you’re unable to take NSAIDs or if NSAIDs are ineffective, a medicine called colchicine can be used instead. Colchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack. It’s best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. Your GP will tell you how long to take it for and how often. When taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea . Corticosteroids Corticosteroids A short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can’t be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including: weight gain thinning of the bones ( osteoporosis ) easy bruising muscle weakness Corticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. This can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint. Medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks You can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to reduce the level of uric acid in your body. Medication Medication to reduce uric acid levels – known as urate-lowering therapy (ULT) – is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you have complications of gout . They should explain that while ULT can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there’s a small risk of side effects. If you decide to start ULT, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. If this isn’t suitable or doesn’t work, other medications may be used instead. These medications are described below. Allopurinol To help relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first. Most people taking allopurinol won’t experience any significant side effects. However, side effects can include: a rash – this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your GP for advice indigestion headaches diarrhoea Febuxostat . If you have very large or painful tophi, they may have to be surgically removed. Joint damage In the most serious cases, surgery may be required to repair or replace a damaged joint. Kidney stones Occasionally, high levels of uric acid can lead to the formation of kidney stones . Some kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pass urine, and can make you feel that you need to pass urine more often. You may be prescribed medication to make your urine less acidic, which should help dissolve any kidney stones that have developed. Read more about .

Gum disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/gum-disease/,About gum disease ,". Healthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn’t bleed when you touch or brush them. Gum disease isn’t always painful and you may be unaware you have it. It’s important to have regular dental check-ups . red and swollen gums bleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeth This stage of gum disease is called gingivitis. If gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as periodontitis, or periodontal disease. bad breath (halitosis) an unpleasant taste in your mouth loose teeth that can make eating difficult gum abscesses (collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth) Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis bleeding, painful gums painful ulcers receding gums inbetween your teeth bad breath a metallic taste in your mouth excess saliva in your mouth difficulty swallowing or talking a high temperature (fever) When to see a dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or ANUG. If you don’t currently have a dentist, search for a dentist near you . Read more about ","Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria. Some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don’t remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness. Seeing your dentist You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Find a dentist near you . Your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth. In some cases, a number of X-rays may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone. Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors, but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause. Poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly, can cause plaque to build up on your teeth. Plaque Your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque, which builds up on your teeth. When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods), bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need, producing acid at the same time. Other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums, making them inflamed and sore. Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth, but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it’s not removed. Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist. Who is most at risk? As well as poor oral hygiene, a number of things can increase your risk of developing problems with your gums. These include: smoking your age – gum disease becomes more common as you get older a family history of gum disease diabetes a weakened immune system – for example, because of conditions such as HIV and AIDS ",,"Complications of gum disease About gum disease If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always phone the dental practice that you normally attend . If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should read our advice on dental emergencies . Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected. Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. It’s much less common in children. If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. If gingivitis isn’t treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. If periodontitis isn’t treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out. Read more about the Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups. In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They’ll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future. Read more about . Dental check-ups It’s important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. If you’ve never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every 1 to 2 years for a check-up. You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you’ve had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment. If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems – for example, if you smoke or have diabetes – you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored. Complications of gum disease If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: gum abscesses (painful collections of pus) receding gums loose teeth loss of teeth Read more about the complications of gum disease . . chemotherapy malnutrition – a condition that occurs when a person’s diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients stress Oral hygiene Good oral hygiene involves: brushing your teeth for about 2 minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion everyday – it doesn’t matter if you use an electric or manual toothbrush but some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush using toothpaste that contains the right amount of fluoride (a natural mineral that helps protect against tooth decay ) flossing your teeth regularly – preferably daily, before brushing your teeth not smoking regularly visiting your dentist – at least once every 1 to 2 years, but more frequently if necessary See the teeth cleaning guide for more information and advice about how to keep your teeth clean. Mouthwash Antiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are available over the counter from pharmacies. However, there’s some debate about whether using mouthwash is necessary for people with healthy gums. Your dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). Your dentist will be able to advise you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it. Chlorhexidine mouthwash can stain your teeth brown if you use it regularly. Rinse your mouth thoroughly between brushing your teeth and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash because some ingredients in toothpaste can prevent the mouthwash working. Scale and polish To remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth, your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. This is a ‘professional clean’ usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist. The dental hygienist will scrape away plaque and tartar from your teeth using special instruments, then polish your teeth to remove marks or stains. If a lot of plaque or tartar has built up, you may need to have more than one scale and polish. The price of a scale and polish can vary depending on what needs to be carried out, so ask your dental hygienist how much it will cost beforehand. Root planing In some cases of gum disease, root planing (debridement) may be required. This is a deep clean under the gums that gets rid of bacteria from the roots of your teeth. local anaesthetic (painkilling medication) to numb the area. You may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing. If you’re having surgery or root planing, you may be given antibiotics (medication to treat infections). Your dentist will tell you whether this is necessary. Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis Antibiotics antibiotics , such as metronidazole or amoxicillin, may be recommended if you have ANUG. You’ll usually have to take these for 3 days. Other side effects of metronidazole and amoxicillin can include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting and diarrhoea . Painkillers Paracetamol and ibuprofen are the most commonly prescribed painkillers. They’re also available over the counter from pharmacies. They may help reduce pain and discomfort. However, paracetamol and ibuprofen aren’t suitable for everyone, so read the manufacturer’s instructions before taking them. Mouthwash Mouthwash containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide may be prescribed to treat ANUG. Some chlorhexidine mouthwashes are also available over the counter, though they may not be as effective as a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash. You should always read the instructions before using mouthwash. Some types may need to be diluted in water before they’re taken. Complications of gum disease If you develop gingivitis and don’t have the plaque or tartar (hardened plaque) removed from your teeth, the condition may get worse and lead to periodontitis. You may develop further complications if you don’t treat periodontitis (where the tissue that supports teeth is affected), including: recurrent gum abscesses (painful collections of pus) increasing damage to the periodontal ligament (the tissue that connects the tooth to the socket) increasing damage to and loss of the alveolar bone (the bone in the jaw that contains the sockets of the teeth) receding gums loose teeth loss of teeth Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis If you have acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) and it’s not treated, it can cause more severe complications. The infection can spread to all areas of your gums and the alveolar bone surrounding your teeth. This can lead to: the gums between your teeth being completely destroyed large ulcers (open sores) leaving permanent holes in your gums loose and unstable teeth If ANUG isn’t properly treated the first time you have it, you’re more likely to have recurring cases in the future. This can cause persistent bad breath (halitosis) and bleeding gums, as well as gradually receding gums. In rare cases, ANUG can lead to gangrene affecting the lips and cheeks. This occurs when tissue starts to die and waste away. If you develop gangrene, you may need to have the dead tissue removed. Other complications Gum disease has also been associated with an increased risk for a number of other health conditions, including: cardiovascular disease lung infections if affected during pregnancy, premature labour and having a baby with a low birth weight ",
Haemorrhoids (piles),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/haemorrhoids-piles/,About haemorrhoids Diagnosing haemorrhoids ,"bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red) itchy bottom a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool a mucus discharge after passing a stool soreness, redness and swelling around your anus Haemorrhoids aren’t usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted. When to seek medical advice However, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include: gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water, but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine and alcohol not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet Rectal examination Your GP may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a digital rectal examination (DRE). During a DRE, your GP will wear gloves and use lubricant. Using their finger, they’ll feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. A DRE shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort. Proctoscopy In some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. A proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that’s inserted into your anus. This allows your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine). GPs are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. However, not all GPs have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to go to a hospital clinic to have the procedure. Types of haemorrhoids After you’ve had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to determine what type of haemorrhoids you have. Haemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. Internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). The nerves in the lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves in the upper part can’t. Haemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. They can be: first degree – small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren’t visible from outside the anus second degree – larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again third degree – one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside (prolapsing and reducible) fourth degree – larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can’t be pushed back inside (irreducible) If you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended. Banding ","The exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but they’re associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed. Many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged constipation – this is often due to a lack of fibre in a person’s diet. Chronic (long-term) diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids. Other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include: being overweight or obese age – as you get older, your body’s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids being pregnant – which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about common pregnancy problems ) having a family history of haemorrhoids regularly lifting heavy objects a persistent cough or repeated vomiting sitting down for long periods of time losing weight (if you’re overweight) exercising regularly – can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight These measures can also reduce the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing in the first place. Electrotherapy can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under a general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic. You may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn’t last long. Rectal bleeding is another possible side effect of the procedure, but this is usually short-lived. The recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker compared with other surgical procedures. There’s a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks. Stapling Stapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. It’s sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic. Stapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. It also tends to be a less painful procedure. However, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. There have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum). ",,"Surgery for haemorrhoids About haemorrhoids Haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Read more about diagnosing haemorrhoids . Surgery carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re unconscious) is sometimes used to remove or shrink large or external haemorrhoids. Read more about and surgery for haemorrhoids . Diagnosing haemorrhoids Your GP can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels. Read more about . Making simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first. Creams, ointments and suppositories (which you insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort. haemorrhoid surgery will usually be recommended. Dietary changes and self care If constipation is thought to be the cause of your haemorrhoids, you need to keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don’t strain when passing stools. You can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables. You should also drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola). When going to the toilet, you should: avoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse use moist toilet paper, rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes to clean your bottom after passing a stool pat the area around your bottom, rather than rubbing it Read more about preventing constipation . Medication Various creams, ointments and suppositories (which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort. These medicines should only be used for five to seven days at a time. If you use them for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus. Any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above. There’s no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it. Don’t use more than one product at once. Corticosteroid cream If you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your GP may prescribe corticosteroid cream , which contains steroids. You shouldn’t use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse. Painkillers Common painkilling medication, such as paracetamol , can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids. However, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen , because it can make rectal bleeding worse. You should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation. Your GP may prescribe products that contain local anaesthetic Laxatives If you’re constipated, your GP may prescribe a laxative . Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels. Banding is usually a day procedure that doesn’t need an anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. You may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. Normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your GP can prescribe something stronger, if needed. You may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. If you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off. Directly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet. This is normal, but there shouldn’t be a lot of bleeding. If you pass a lot of bright red blood or blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately. Injections (sclerotherapy) During sclerotherapy, a chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. This relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. It also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. After about 4 to 6 weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up. After the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day. You may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. You should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure. Electrotherapy Electrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another alternative to banding for people with smaller haemorrhoids. During the procedure, a device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate the haemorrhoid. An electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that’s placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. The specialist can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe. Surgery Although most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery. There are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink. Read more about surgery for haemorrhoids . Surgery for haemorrhoids There are many different surgical procedures for piles. Haemorrhoidectomy A haemorrhoidectomy is an operation to remove haemorrhoids. It’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic , which means you’ll be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. A conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. You’ll need to take a week or so off work to recover. You’ll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. You may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. Seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer. Haemorrhoidal artery ligation Haemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids. It’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a small ultrasound probe into your anus. The probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid. General risks of haemorrhoid surgery Although the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. These can include: bleeding or passing blood clots, which may happen a week or so after the operation infection, which may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess) – you may be given a short course of antibiotics after surgery to reduce this risk urinary retention (difficulty emptying your bladder) faecal incontinence (the involuntarily passing of stools) anal fistula (a small channel that develops between the anal canal and surface of the skin, near the anus) These problems can often be treated with medication or more surgery. Ask your surgeon to explain the risks in more detail before deciding to have surgery.

These quickly develop into larger yellow-grey mouth ulcers with red edges. The ulcers can be painful and make eating, drinking and swallowing difficult. They should pass within a week. Spotty rash and blisters Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you’ll probably notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin. These typically develop on the fingers, the backs or palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and occasionally on the buttocks and groin. The spots may then turn into small blisters with a grey centre. The spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and typically last up to 10 days. What to do if you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease If you have hand, foot and mouth disease, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better. There’s no cure for it, so you have to let it run its course. Do drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – water or milk are ideal; it may help to give a baby smaller but more frequent bottle or breast milk feeds eat soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt and soups if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable – avoid hot, acidic or spicy foods and drinks take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to ease a sore throat and fever – aspirin shouldn’t be given to children under the age of 16; paracetamol is best if you’re pregnant try gargling with warm, salty water to relieve discomfort from mouth ulcers – it’s important not to swallow the mixture, so this isn’t recommended for young children alternatively, use mouth gels, rinses or sprays for mouth ulcers – these are available from pharmacies, but aren’t routinely recommended, and some aren’t suitable for young children; ask your pharmacist for advice and make sure you read the instructions first You should keep your child away from nursery or school until they’re feeling better. Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they’re feeling better. When to get medical advice You don’t usually need medical attention if you think you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. The infection will usually pass in 7 to 10 days, and there isn’t much your doctor can do. Antibiotics won’t help as hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a virus. If you’re unsure whether you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, you can phone 111 or your GP for advice. Get medical advice if: your child is unable or unwilling to drink any fluids your child has signs of dehydration , such as unresponsiveness, passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or cold hands and feet your child develops fits (seizures), confusion, weakness or a loss of consciousness your child is under three months old and has a temperature of 38°C (101°F) or above, or is between 3 and 6 months old and has a temperature of 39°C (102°F) or above the skin becomes very painful, red, swollen and hot, or there’s a discharge of pus Get advice from your GP if you’re pregnant and you become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about, but there’s a small chance it could make your baby ill if you’re infected shortly before you give birth. Read more about the risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy How hand, foot and mouth disease spreads The infection can be spread by close person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus is found in: the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of an infected person – you can become infected if you get these on your hands and then touch your mouth, or if you breathe in the droplets an infected person’s poo – if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they can contaminate food or surfaces an infected person’s saliva or fluid from their blisters – you can become infected if this gets in your mouth The infection is caused by a number of different viruses, so it’s possible to get it more than once. Most people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older. Preventing hand, foot and mouth disease It’s not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease, but following this advice can help stop the infection spreading. Do stay off work, school or nursery until you or your child are feeling better – there’s usually no need to wait until the last blister has healed, provided you’re otherwise well use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and put used tissues in a bin as soon as possible wash your hands with soap and water often – particularly after going to the toilet, coughing, sneezing or handling nappies, and before preparing food disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated – it’s best to use a bleach-based household cleaner wash any bedding or clothing that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash Don’t do not share cups, utensils, towels and clothes with people who are infected ","It’s most common in young children – particularly those under 10 – but can affect older children and adults as well. Hand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home. The infection is not related to foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs. ",,,

Less reliable signs of head lice include: small white eggs or nits (egg cases) in the hair behind the ears or at the back of the neck an itchy scalp a rash on the back of the neck feeling as though something is moving in the hair How to spot head lice The only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. This is called detection combing. You can buy detection combs from your local pharmacy ",,,,"Detection combing can be carried out on dry or wet hair. Dry combing takes less time, but wet combing is more accurate because washing with conditioner stops head lice from moving. Wet detection combing To use the wet detection method: wash the hair with ordinary shampoo apply plenty of conditioner use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp draw the comb down from the roots to the ends of the hair with every stroke, and check the comb for lice each time – remove lice by wiping the comb with tissue paper or rinsing it work through the hair, section by section, so that the whole head of hair is combed through do this at least twice to help ensure you haven’t missed any areas continue until you find no more lice If you find head lice, you should check the rest of your family.

Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon for further tests. You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test. Read more about diagnosing hearing loss Why it happens Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies: sensorineural hearing loss – caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve; this occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury conductive hearing loss – when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax , glue ear or a build-up of fluid from an ear infection , or because of a perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones It’s also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss. Some people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older. Read more about earache , discharge or hearing loss.

Read more tips to protect your hearing ","Diagnosing hearing loss Preventing hearing loss However, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home and using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments. You should also see your GP if you have signs of an ear infection, such as flu Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve. This occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury. Conductive hearing loss happens when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax or glue ear. Age Age is the biggest single cause of hearing loss. Hearing loss that develops as a result of getting older is often known as age-related hearing loss or presbycusis. Most people begin to lose a small amount of their hearing from around 40 years of age. This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems. As your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or children’s voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as “s”, “f” and “th”. This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult. Loud noises Another common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged. You’re at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you: work with noisy equipment, such as pneumatic drills or compressed-air hammers work in environments where there’s loud music, such as a nightclub regularly listen to music at a high volume through headphones Hearing loss can also occur suddenly after exposure to an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma. See preventing hearing loss for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Other types of sensorineural hearing loss Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged. Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss can also be caused by: the genes you inherit – some people may be born deaf or become deaf over time because of a genetic abnormality viral infections of the inner ear – such as mumps or measles viral infections of the auditory nerve – such as mumps or rubella acoustic neuroma – a non-cancerous (benign) growth on or near the auditory nerve meningitis – an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord encephalitis – inflammation of the brain multiple sclerosis – a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a head injury an autoimmune condition malformation of the ear stroke – where the blood supply to the brain is cut off or interrupted Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear (glue ear), or an ear infection . Conductive hearing loss can also be caused by: a perforated eardrum – where the eardrum is torn or has a hole in it damage to the hearing bones from injury, a collapsed ear drum or conditions such as cholesteatoma swelling around the eustachian tube – caused by jaw surgery or radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer malformation of the ear Eustachian tube dysfunction something becoming trapped in the ear (a foreign body) Conductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery.

Action on Hearing Loss estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK with some degree of hearing impairment or deafness. Hearing loss can occur suddenly, but usually develops gradually. General signs of hearing loss can include: difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say asking people to repeat themselves listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up higher than other people require Read more about the The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is. In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person’s ability to hear and communicate. These include: digital hearing aids – which are available through the NHS bone anchored implants – suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss middle ear implants – suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids cochlear implants – for people who find hearing aids aren’t powerful enough lip reading and/or sign language – such as British Sign Language (BSL) Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don’t work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs).

Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly. General signs of hearing loss Early signs of hearing loss can include: difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations asking people to repeat themselves listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need difficulty hearing the telephone or doorbell finding it difficult to tell which direction noise is coming from regularly feeling tired or stressed, from having to concentrate while listening In some cases, you may recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they notice it themselves. Research suggests it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it. If you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of tinnitus , which is often associated with hearing loss.

Read more about diagnosing hearing loss radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer, certain chemotherapy medicines or certain antibiotics can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss. People with diabetes , chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease are also at increased risk of hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases. Diagnosing hearing loss See your GP if you’re having problems with your hearing. They’ll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests. You may also want to visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test . Ear examination During an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including: a blockage caused by earwax , fluid or an object an ear canal infection a bulging ear drum – indicating an infection inside the middle ear fluid behind the ear drum – known as glue ear a perforated ear drum a collapsed ear drum skin collected in the middle ear (cholesteatoma) Your GP will ask if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss. Referral to a specialist Some of the hearing tests you may have include a: tuning fork test (sometimes performed by your GP) pure tone audiometry bone conduction test These tests are described below. Tuning fork test A tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it’s gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing. The tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head. This test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn’t working properly. Pure tone audiometry Pure tone audiometry tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button. Bone conduction test A bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It’s used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working. Bone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard. Bone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both. Read about how hearing tests are performed Newborn hearing screening All newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. The tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need. Read more about the newborn hearing test Levels of hearing loss Very few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you’re able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below. Mild deafness If you’re mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations. Moderate deafness If you’re moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example. Severe deafness If you’re severely deaf, the quietest sound you’re able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid. Profound deafness If you’re profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English. Read more about , including different types of hearing aids and sign language. How hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition. Hearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable. For example, earwax build-up can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics . Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair a perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones. However, hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or to the nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent. Hearing aids If you have hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid. About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them. A hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you can hear things more clearly. The microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation. Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear. Hearing aids help improve hearing, but don’t give you your hearing back. They’re suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you. If a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You’ll also be shown how to use and care for it. After your hearing aid has been fitted, you should have a follow-up appointment within 12 weeks. NHS hearing aids The NHS loans hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you’ll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment. In the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital. Instead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop. The type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid may be issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it’s not available on the NHS. Types of hearing aids The different types of hearing aids are described below. Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids BTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear. Some types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments. Open fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould. Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids Receiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal. This means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices. In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal. The working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell. In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible. Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids. However, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections. Body-worn (BW) hearing aids Body-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear. This type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid. CROS/BiCROS CROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn’t have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that’s able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available. BiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that’s able to hear. They’re useful for people who don’t have any hearing in one ear, with some hearing loss in the other ear. Bone conduction hearing aids Bone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can’t wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone. They can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear. The part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) A Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower. Unlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it’s not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears. Some people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre. Middle ear implants These are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate. They’re suitable for people who can’t use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help. Disposable hearing aids Disposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss. The battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids tend to be expensive in the long term and are only available privately. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind your ear during surgery. They have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array). The external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally. A cochlear implant is sometimes recommended for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, which isn’t helped by hearing aids. Both ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only able to have one implant on the NHS. Before a cochlear implant is recommended, you’ll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren’t suitable. If a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears) during an operation and switched on a few weeks later. There are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year. Safety According to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven’t been immunised against pneumococcal disease. In August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection. Although the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it’s slightly higher than for the general population. Auditory brainstem implants In some cases of severe to profound hearing loss, where there are problems with the nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used. An ABI is an electrical device made up of: electrodes implanted into the part of the brain responsible for processing sound (in the brainstem) a receiver device placed under the skin behind your ear a small sound processor outside your ear When the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes. Lip reading and sign language Hearing loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English. For people who experience hearing loss after they’ve learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a person’s mouth movements while they’re speaking, to understand what they’re saying. For people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn sign language , such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning. BSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech. The Action on Hearing Loss website has more information on British Sign Language (BSL) and lip-reading . Preventing hearing loss The ears are fragile structures that can be damaged in many ways, so it’s not always possible to prevent hearing loss. The risk of your hearing being damaged by loud noises depends on how loud the noises are and how long you’re exposed to them. Experts agree that continued exposure to noise at or above 85dB (similar to a lawn mower or loud traffic) can, over time, cause hearing loss. However, by following the advice below it’s possible to reduce your risk of noise-induced hearing loss (hearing loss from loud noise): Don’t have your television, radio or music on too loud. This is particularly important if you have young children in the house, because their ears are more delicate than an adult’s. If you can’t have a comfortable conversation with someone who is two metres (about 6.5ft) away from you, turn the volume down. You shouldn’t have dull hearing or ringing in your ears after listening to music. Use headphones that block out more outside noise, rather than turning up the volume. You can buy add-ons for your existing headphones that block out more outside noise, or noise cancelling headphones. Use ear protection equipment such as ear muffs or ear plugs if you work in a noisy environment, such as a pub, nightclub, a garage workshop or on a building site. It’s important to insert ear plugs correctly to gain the benefit of wearing them. Use ear-protection equipment at loud concerts and at other events where there are high noise levels, such as motor races. Don’t insert objects into your ears or your children’s ears. This includes fingers, cotton buds, cotton wool and tissue. ",
Hiatus hernia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/hiatus-hernia/,About hiatus hernia Diagnosing hiatus hernia ,"gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) . GORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly. dysphagia ). You should see your GP if you have frequent and severe . If a hiatus hernia isn’t causing any noticeable problems, it doesn’t usually need to be treated. Surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there’s a risk of serious complications. Read more about caused by a hiatus hernia. These include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3 hours after eating or drinking avoiding drinking during the night avoiding alcohol avoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking raising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don’t use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomen If you’re overweight, losing weight Read about stopping smoking . Medication Antacids Antacids shouldn’t be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed by your body. They may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice. Alginates Alginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. They work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid. H2-receptor antagonists In some cases, a medicine known as an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing GORD. Examples of H2RAs include cimetidine, famotidine (PepcidTwo) and ranitidine. H2RAs block the effects of the chemical histamine, which your body uses to produce stomach acid. H2RAs therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon. However, possible side effects may include diarrhoea , headaches , tiredness and a rash. Some H2RAs are available over the counter at pharmacies. These types of HR2As are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you’re not sure whether these medicines are suitable for you. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) Your GP may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Examples of the PPIs you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole. Most people tolerate PPIs well and side effects are uncommon. When they do occur, they’re usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick or constipation . To minimise any side effects, your GP will prescribe the lowest possible dose of PPIs they think will be effective. You should let your GP know if the prescribed dose of PPIs doesn’t work. A stronger dose may be needed. Surgery Surgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area) if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication. Prior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal pH studies). Laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) A procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat GORD and sliding hiatus hernias. LNF is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in. During LNF, the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. This should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach. LNF is carried out under general anaesthetic , so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort. The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete. After having LNF, you should be able to leave hospital after you’ve recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. This is usually within 2 to 3 days. Depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks. For the first 6 weeks after surgery, it’s recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak. Common side effects of LNF include difficulties swallowing ( dysphagia ), belching, bloating and flatulence . These side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. However, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. In such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required. Para-oesophageal hiatus hernia If you have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (see complications of a hiatus hernia for more information). Complications of hiatus hernia Complications from a hiatus hernia are rare, but they can be serious. Hiatus hernias that slide in and out of the chest area (sliding hiatus hernias) can cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) . This is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (gullet). This can damage the oesophagus, increasing the risk of problems. Oesophageal ulcers Damage to the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis) caused by stomach acid can lead to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making swallowing difficult. Ulcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlying . In most cases, over-the-counter medicines called antacids or alginates are used to treat the condition. Read more about oesophageal cancer . Strangulated hernia ","Hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn’t develop properly. Who’s affected Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it’s more common in people who are: over 50 years of age overweight pregnant It’s estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia. There’s also a rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth. Types of hiatus hernia There are 2 main types of hiatus hernia. They are: sliding hiatus hernias – hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type) para-oesophageal hiatus hernias – also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5 to 15% of hiatus hernias are of this type) These pages mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body. Read more about diagnosing a hiatus hernia . gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Strangulation occurs when the hernia becomes knotted and the blood supply to the area is cut off. Emergency surgery is usually required to correct the problem. ",,"Complications of hiatus hernia About hiatus hernia A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (‘hiatus’) in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy). Hiatus hernia and heartburn Lifestyle advice may include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3 hours after eating or drinking . Further problems It’s rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer . Read more about the complications of a hiatus hernia . Diagnosing hiatus hernia A hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or X-ray. Gastroscopy A gastroscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor. The gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. The procedure may be carried out using a local anaesthetic or a sedative to help you relax. Barium meal X-ray The barium meal X-ray , also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of identifying a hiatus hernia. As part of the test, you’ll be asked to drink some barium solution. Barium is a non-toxic chemical that shows up clearly on an X-ray. Once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of X-rays will be taken to identify any problems. If you need to have a barium meal X-ray, you won’t be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system. You’ll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. This will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an X-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. Your bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach. A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick after a barium meal X-ray and the barium may cause constipation . Your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system. Lifestyle changes There are several things you can do yourself to help relieve . Oesophageal stricture Repeated damage to the lining of your oesophagus can lead to the formation of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is allowed to build up, it can cause your oesophagus to become narrowed. This is known as oesophageal stricture. An oesophageal stricture can make swallowing food difficult and painful. Oesophageal strictures can be treated using a tiny balloon to dilate (widen) the oesophagus. This procedure is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic . Barrett’s oesophagus and cancer Repeated damage to the oesophagus can also lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus. ",

Hodgkin lymphoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/hodgkin-lymphoma/,About Hodgkin lymphoma ,". Who’s affected? Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected. The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches. The swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection. However, it’s highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes , as these glands often swell as a response to infection. night sweats unintentional weight loss a high temperature (fever) a persistent cough or feeling of breathlessness persistent itching of the skin all over the body abdominal pain or indigestion A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to: persistent tiredness or fatigue an increased risk of infections excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds , heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin In some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their lymph glands when they drink alcohol. When to seek medical advice If necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral . Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: fatigue breathlessness increased vulnerability to infection bleeding and bruising more easily headaches , fever and muscle pain tiredness nausea diarrhoea You may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. Any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication. Follow-up a high temperature (fever) headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness Vaccination You should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date. Other health problems The risk of developing other health conditions in the future, such as cardiovascular disease and lung disease, is also higher in people who have had Hodgkin lymphoma. ","Diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system you take immunosuppressant medication glandular fever You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition. Read more about the . How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn’t known. The DNA gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably. The abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: bone marrow spleen liver skin lungs Who’s most at risk? While the cause of the initial mutation that triggers Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV glandular fever having previously had non-Hodgkin lymphoma ","biopsy . This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. Read more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma . Biopsy A biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory. Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and a general anaesthetic may be required (where you’re asleep). Further tests may include: blood tests bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the cancer has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic chest X-ray – this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs computerised tomography (CT) scan – this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body, to check the spread of the cancer positron emission tomography (PET) scan ","Complications of Hodgkin lymphoma About Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Read more about the Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it’s also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. chemotherapy , followed by radiotherapy Read more about: complications of Hodgkin lymphoma chemotherapy or radiotherapy being very overweight ( obese ) – this may be more of a risk factor in women than men Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and isn’t thought to run in families. Although your risk is increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it’s not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault or lifestyle factors. Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. The condition is slightly more common in men than women. Diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma Further testing Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma When testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. Staging means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread. The main stages of Hodgkin lymphoma are: stage 1 – the cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs) stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm stage 4 – the cancer has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Surgery isn’t generally used to treat the condition, except for the biopsy used to diagnose it. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility , which may be temporary or permanent Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplant to replace the damaged bone marrow. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is most often used to treat early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body. Other common side effects include: tiredness nausea and vomiting dry mouth loss of appetite Read more about: side effects of radiotherapy complications of Hodgkin lymphoma Steroid medication Steroid medication The steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. Common side effects of steroid medication include: increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain indigestion problems sleeping feeling agitated Rituximab If you’re diagnosed with a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab. Rituximab is a type of biological therapy called a monoclonal antibody. It attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell. It’s given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours. Side effects of the drug can include: flu These appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: living with Hodgkin lymphoma Macmillan: living with Hodgkin lymphoma Complications of Hodgkin lymphoma Some people treated for Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they’ve been cured. Weakened immune system Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you’re being treated. If you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections. Examples of live vaccines include the: shingles vaccine BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) Infertility Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent. Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options. Second cancers People who have had Hodgkin lymphoma are more likely to get lymphoma, leukaemia or other cancers in the future. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy further increase this risk. Second cancers, such as breast cancer or lung cancer , usually develop more than 10 years after you’re treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. In rare cases, other types of cancer, such as leukaemia or other lymphomas, develop after only a few years. You can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise. ",

",,"Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s natural defences against infection. Lymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body’s cells. Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops. In lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. These lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour). There are 2 main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) ",
High cholesterol,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/high-cholesterol/,About high cholesterol ,"About cholesterol Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they’re called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. From there it’s either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. For this reason, HDL is referred to as “good cholesterol” and higher levels are better. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. If there’s too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. For this reason, LDL is known as “bad cholesterol”. The amount of cholesterol in the blood, both HDL and LDL , is measured with a blood test . The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease. Why should I lower my cholesterol? Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) heart attack stroke transient ischaemic attack (TIA) – often known as a “mini stroke” peripheral arterial disease (PAD) This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body. Your risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood’s cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity ( angina ). Children Children at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia will be tested by the time they reach 10 years of age. This is because any signs of CVD, such as thickening of the carotid artery wall, will be identifiable by this age. The assessment will be carried out by a specialist with expertise in familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and young people. Read more about ","Diagnosing high cholesterol Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol. These include: an unhealthy diet – in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat smoking – a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) having diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension) having a family history of stroke or heart disease There’s also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. This can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily. When should my cholesterol levels be tested? Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a family history of early cardiovascular disease have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition are overweight have high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels Read more about how cholesterol is tested What should my cholesterol levels be? Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L. As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: 5mmol/L or less for healthy adults 4mmol/L or less for those at high risk As a general guide, LDL levels should be: 3mmol/L or less for healthy adults 2mmol/L or less for those at high risk An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease. Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease. Many different factors can contribute to high blood cholesterol, including lifestyle factors like smoking, an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, as well as having an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Lifestyle Your lifestyle can increase your risk of developing high blood cholesterol. This includes: an unhealthy diet – some foods, such as liver, kidneys and eggs, contain cholesterol (dietary cholesterol), but this has little effect on blood cholesterol: it’s the total amount of saturated fat in your diet that’s more important to watch; read more about preventing high cholesterol lack of exercise or physical activity – this can increase your level of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) obesity – if you’re overweight, it’s likely that you’ll have higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) drinking excessive amounts of alcohol – regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol can increase your cholesterol and triglyceride levels smoking – a chemical in cigarettes called acrolein stops “good cholesterol” (HDL) transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Underlying conditions People with high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes often have high cholesterol. Some other health conditions that can also cause raised levels of cholesterol include: kidney disease liver disease an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) For more information, you can read the National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines about the use of ","Diagnosing high cholesterol Blood cholesterol levels are measured with a simple blood test. Getting a cholesterol test A blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL), good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and other fatty substances (triglycerides) in your blood. You may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you’re asleep at night. This ensures that all food is completely digested and won’t affect the outcome of the test. Your GP or practice nurse can carry out the cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger. A newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) is now sometimes used because it’s thought to be a more accurate way of estimating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL. Non-HDL cholesterol is total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol. It’s also not necessary to fast before the test, so it is more convenient. Who should be tested? Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini-stroke (TIA) , or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are over the age of 40 – people over 40 should have their estimate of CVD risk reviewed regularly have a family history of early cardiovascular disease – for example, if your father or brother developed heart disease or had a heart attack or stroke before the age of 55, or if your mother or sister had these conditions before the age of 65 have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia are overweight or obese have high blood pressure or diabetes have another medical condition, such as kidney disease , an underactive thyroid , or an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) – these conditions can cause increased levels of cholesterol or triglycerides Results After your cholesterol test, your GP or nurse will explain your results and calculate whether you have a high, moderate or low risk of developing heart disease or stroke (cardiovascular disease) within the next 10 years. However, this risk isn’t just based on your cholesterol reading. It also takes into account: your BMI (body mass index) – which measures your weight in relation to your height treatable risk factors – such as high blood pressure (hypertension) , diabetes and other medical conditions your age, sex, family history and ethnicity Based on your results, your GP or nurse will recommend steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing CVD. This may include advice about making lifestyle changes, such as eating more healthily – by increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, for example – and doing more exercise. Cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins , may also be recommended. Read more about For further information, see the NICE guidance about familial hypercholesterolaemia ","Preventing high cholesterol About high cholesterol Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. It’s vital for the normal functioning of the body. Cell membranes, hormones and vitamin D are created by your body using cholesterol. There are 2 main sources of the cholesterol in your blood: cholesterol in the food you eat cholesterol produced by your liver Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health. How can I lower my cholesterol level? The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet . It’s important to keep your diet low in fatty food. You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol from returning . Other lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and giving up smoking , can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol. If these measures don’t reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins . Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. The benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks. Read more about how high cholesterol is treated Other factors There are a number of factors associated with high cholesterol that can’t be changed that increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke . Doctors refer to these as “fixed factors”. They include: family history of early coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke – you’re more likely to have high cholesterol if you have a close male relative (father or brother) aged under 55, or a female relative (mother or sister) aged under 65, who’s had CHD or stroke a family history of a cholesterol-related condition – for example, having a parent, brother or sister with familial hypercholesterolaemia age – the older you are, the greater the likelihood of your arteries narrowing (atherosclerosis) ethnic group – people of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan descent are at increased risk of having a heart attack sex – males are more likely to have heart attacks than females If you have a fixed risk factor, or several fixed risk factors, it’s even more important to look at your lifestyle and any underlying conditions you may have. Familial hypercholesterolaemia Familial hypercholesterolaemia is the medical term for high cholesterol that runs in families. It’s caused by a gene alteration inherited from a parent, rather than an unhealthy lifestyle. People with familial hypercholesterolaemia have raised cholesterol from birth, which can lead to the early development of heart problems, such as atherosclerosis and CHD. In the UK, familial hypercholesterolaemia is thought to affect about 1 in 500 people, which means approximately 120,000 people are thought to be affected. There’s a one in two (50%) chance that a child or brother or sister of someone with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also have the condition. Read more about the importance of Familial hypercholesterolaemia People with familial hypercholesterolaemia, or inherited high cholesterol, are at increased risk of developing CVD. In the UK, most of the 120,000 people thought to have the condition are undiagnosed and untreated. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) If you’ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you’ll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise. After a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn’t dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication. Changing your diet, stopping smoking and exercising more will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing. Diet Eating a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in saturated fats can reduce your level of “bad cholesterol” (LDL). Try to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat: fatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies butter, ghee and lard cream, soured cream, crème fraîche and ice cream cheese, particularly hard cheese cakes and biscuits milk chocolate coconut oil, coconut cream and palm oil The government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person’s food energy should come from saturated fat. This equates to no more than: 30g of saturated fat a day for the average man 20g of saturated fat a day for the average woman Children should have less. Check the labels on the foods you’re eating to find out how much saturated fat you’re consuming. Omega-3 fatty acids Many experts believe that the fats found in avocados and oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you. These are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. However, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to obesity . For people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. However, there’s no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit. Cholesterol-lowering medication medication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension) if it affects you. The most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below. Statins Statins block the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. This leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level. You’ll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. Other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin. When someone has side effects from using a statin, it’s described as having an “intolerance” to it. Side effects of statins include headaches , muscle pain and stomach problems, such as indigestion , diarrhoea or constipation . Statins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life. Cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them. Aspirin In some cases, a low daily dose of aspirin may be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors. Low-dose aspirin can help to prevent blood clots forming, particularly for someone who’s had a heart attack , has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) . You may also be advised to have periodic blood tests to ensure your liver is functioning well. Ezetimibe Ezetimibe is a medication that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food and bile juices in your intestines into your blood. It’s generally not as effective as statins, but is less likely to cause side effects. You can take ezetimibe at the same time as your usual statin if your cholesterol levels aren’t low enough with the statin alone. The side effects of this combination are generally the same as those of the statin on its own (muscle pain and stomach problems). . Preventing high cholesterol You can lower your cholesterol by eating a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in saturated fat, exercising regularly, not smoking and cutting down on alcohol. Diet If you have an unhealthy diet that’s high in fat, fatty plaques are much more likely to build up in your arteries. This is because fatty foods contain cholesterol. There are two types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid foods containing saturated fats, as they will increase the levels of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) in your blood. Foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter ghee – a type of butter often used in Indian cooking lard cream hard cheese cakes and biscuits food that contains coconut or palm oil However, it’s not healthy to completely cut out all types of fat from your diet. It’s important to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats – they’ve been shown to increase levels of “good cholesterol” (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and reduce any blockage in your arteries. Foods that are high in unsaturated fat include: oily fish – such as mackerel, salmon and tuna avocados nuts and seeds sunflower, rapeseed and olive oil A low-fat diet including lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, and plenty of fruit and vegetables has also been shown to help lower cholesterol. Fruit and vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and fibre, and help keep your body in good condition. Aim to eat five 80g portions of fruit and vegetables every day . Smoking A chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting fatty deposits to the liver, leading to high cholesterol and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This means smoking is a major risk factor for both heart attacks and strokes . If you decide to stop smoking, your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will provide you with dedicated help and advice about the best ways to give up smoking. You can also call Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84. The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement. Exercise Being active and exercising regularly will increase the levels of HDL in your body by stimulating the body to move fatty deposits to the liver, so they can be broken down. Exercise will also help you maintain a healthy weight, and lose weight if you’re overweight. Being overweight can increase the amount of “bad cholesterol” in your blood. Another benefit of regular physical activity is it will help lower your blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. Doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week is recommended to help lower your cholesterol. Walking , swimming and cycling are good examples of this type of exercise.

Huntington’s disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/huntingtons-disease/,"Huntington’s disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain causing them to stop working properly. It’s passed on (inherited) from a person’s parents. The damage to the brain gets worse over time. It can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health. ","The condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies. a lack of emotions and not recognising the needs of others periods of aggression, excitement, depression , antisocial behaviour and anger apathy – causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations irritability and impulsiveness Speak to your GP if: psychiatric problems – some people develop obsessive behaviours , delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don’t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections communication problems – difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech sexual problems – a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands balance problems In the later stages of Huntington’s disease, the person will need full nursing care. Death is usually from a secondary cause, like pneumonia or another infection. You might find the palliative care section useful if you’re caring for someone who’s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care. Juvenile Huntington’s disease Juvenile Huntington’s disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. Common signs include: a rapid decline in school performance changes in handwriting problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to the features of Parkinson’s disease ) seizures (fits) see if it’s likely you have Huntington’s disease rule out similar conditions They’ll examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance and walking. They’ll find out if you have any involuntary movements, such as chorea (fidgety or jerky movements). Tests to diagnose Huntington’s disease You might have genetic testing to confirm if you have Huntington’s disease if: your doctor strongly suspects you have the condition Speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, can help with communication and day-to-day living. Regular exercise is also very important. People who are active tend to feel much better physically and mentally than those who don’t. Medication for Huntington’s disease Antidepressants to treat depression Antidepressants can help improve mood swings and treat depression . Mood stabilisers to treat irritability or mood swings Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The condition will affect their ability to drive. The DVLA will write to your doctor, with your permission, to ask for their opinion about your condition. Based on that information, they’ll decide whether you can still drive and for how long before another assessment is needed. You can view the National Care Framework for Huntington’s Disease on the Scottish Huntington’s Association (SHA) website. The SHA employs Huntington’s Disease (HD) Specialists in many areas of Scotland who work as part of multi-disciplinary teams along with HD Clinical Leads , physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. ","Huntington’s disease is caused by a faulty gene. Cells in parts of the brain are very sensitive to the effects of the faulty gene. This makes them function poorly and eventually die. A parent with the Huntington’s disease gene has one good copy of the gene and one faulty copy. This means there’s a: 50:50 chance that each of their children will develop Huntington’s disease – affected children can pass the gene to children they may have 50:50 chance that each of their children won’t develop Huntington’s disease – unaffected children can’t pass the gene to children they may have It’s difficult to predict how old a child will be when they develop the condition if they inherit the abnormal gene. Diagnosing Huntington’s disease If you’re considering genetic testing, your GP will refer you to a genetic counsellor first. Speak to your healthcare professional if you’re interested in taking part in research for Huntington’s disease. Financial information and support It’s worth finding out what benefits you may be entitled to if you have Huntington’s disease, or if you’re looking after someone with the condition. The Scottish Huntington’s Association Financial Wellbeing Service provides information, confidential advice and support to people living with Huntington’s disease. You can also contact the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) Read more about benefits if you need care, and carers’ benefits Driving ","Genetic test The children of someone with Huntington’s disease can take a genetic test after the age of 18 to see whether they’ve inherited the faulty gene. It’s possible to have the gene change and still be healthy when you’re tested. This is known as “premanifest Huntington’s disease”. If they’ve inherited the faulty gene, they’ll develop Huntington’s disease, but it’s not possible to work out when. You can ask your GP or neurologist for an appointment at a genetic clinic. You’ll receive some counselling and blood samples will be taken. Your DNA from the blood samples will be analysed to see whether you have inherited the faulty gene. Scottish Huntington’s Association has a national youth service to help and support children and young people who are living within a Huntington’s family. Brain scan In the early stages of Huntington’s disease, there may not be any specific changes on the brain scan. A doctor might use a brain scan if they’re concerned there may be other problems in addition to Huntington’s disease. A brain scan may involve having a computerised tomography (CT scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . Getting tested in pregnancy If you’re pregnant and know you have the Huntington’s disease gene, it’s possible for your unborn baby to be tested during pregnancy at 11 weeks. You can discuss this with a genetic counselling team. ","Should I get tested? Not everyone wants to know if they’ve inherited the faulty gene. It’s a personal choice. Some mood stabilizers can’t be used during pregnancy. Medication to suppress involuntary movements Medication can suppress involuntary movements. In the UK, antipsychotic medicines are usually preferred. Antipsychotic medication might help control delusions and violent outbursts, but they can have severe side effects, such as: stiffness and rigidity sedation moving slowly Living with Huntington’s disease Help is available to assist people with Huntington’s disease in their day-to-day life. This might include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Daily routines such as getting dressed and eating meals can be frustrating and exhausting. The types of help outlined below aim to ease the strain of the condition by improving skills that may deteriorate. Help with communication Speech and language therapy can improve communication skills, and memory. It can help with swallowing problems . Communication aids can sometimes be helpful, as they allow communication without the need for talking. For example, you can point to symbols on a chart to show your mood or whether you’re hungry. The family of someone with Huntington’s disease can try alternative ways of communicating if speech is a problem. Help with mealtimes People with Huntington’s disease might need to have a high-calorie diet. A dietitian can help you work out an appropriate diet plan. Food should be easy to chew, swallow and digest. It can be cut into small pieces or puréed to prevent choking. Feeding equipment like special straws and non-slip mats can help. At some point, you might be offered a feeding tube that goes into the stomach. If a person doesn’t want to be artificially fed, they should tell their family and doctor. They may want to consider making an advance decision (a living will) or a statement of wishes and preferences. Occupational therapy An occupational therapist (OT) can help with day-to-day activities. Your home can be adapted by social services to make life easier for a person with Huntington’s disease. You might also need to think about wheelchair access.

Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/hodgkin-lymphoma-children/,Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults. ,E means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes) ,"Sometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin. How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed As lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It’s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic. If Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. These tests include X-rays, blood tests, CT, MRI and PET scans. Very often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. This is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands. The tests that are carried out are called staging tests. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve. Staging ",,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. What is Hodgkin lymphoma? Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are 2 main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL. The lymphatic system The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease. The lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. Lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but Hodgkin Lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. The other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. Glands can swell in these areas as part of the body’s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma. The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50. There are 2 main types of lymphoma: non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) stage 1 – only 1 group of lymph nodes is affected and the lymphoma is only on 1 side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs that controls breathing) stage 2 – 2 or more groups of lymph nodes are affected, but they are only on 1 side of the diaphragm. stage 3 – the lymphoma is in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm stage 4 – the lymphoma has spread outside the lymph nodes to other organs such as the liver, lungs or bone marrow As well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code – either A, B, or E: Chemotherapy This is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Radiotherapy This is used in less than half of people with Hodgkin lymphoma. It treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss low blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding tiredness Your child’s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects. Clinical trials If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL) non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/hyperglycaemia-high-blood-sugar/,"Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) can affect people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes , as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes. It can occasionally affect people who don’t have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack , or have a severe infection. Hyperglycaemia shouldn’t be confused with hypoglycaemia , which is when a person’s blood sugar level drops too low. This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes. Is hyperglycaemia serious? ","increased thirst and a dry mouth needing to pee frequently tiredness blurred vision unintentional weight loss recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections What should my blood sugar level be? When you’re first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to. You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is. Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking: if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal if you’re tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale) If you’re not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team. You may be advised to: change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you’re dehydrated exercise more often – gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).

Occasional mild episodes aren’t usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods. Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) – severe dehydration caused by the body trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels. hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts. Be as active as possible – getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you’re taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much Take extra care when you’re ill – your care team can provide you with some “sick day rules” that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness. Monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it. ",
Hyperhidrosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/hyperhidrosis/,About hyperhidrosis ,"The advice below may help. Avoid triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol Use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon Wearing black or white clothing can minimise signs of sweating Armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes Wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture Avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible Ideally wear shoes made of leather, and try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day Stronger antiperspirants If a regular antiperspirant doesn’t control your sweating, your GP may prescribe or suggest a stronger one for you. Antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning. The most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help. Anticholinergics You may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands. Anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They’re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful. ","In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including: pregnancy or the menopause anxiety certain medications low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) infections Read more about the . How hyperhidrosis is treated Hyperhidrosis can be divided into 2 types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis Hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis. Although it’s not clear why it develops, it’s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it’s possible your genes may also play a role. The sympathetic nervous system The sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body’s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder. The sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body. A specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis. It’s thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body. Genes Some cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause. A genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children. Secondary hyperhidrosis If a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it’s known as secondary hyperhidrosis. Secondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including: pregnancy the menopause – when a woman’s monthly periods stop anxiety low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) obesity certain medications – including some antidepressants , propranolol, pilocarpine, and bethanechol being drunk or “high” on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you have become addicted to them some infections, such as tuberculosis and HIV Parkinson’s disease disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as Hodgkin lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells) Secondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body. the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating Removing or destroying sweat glands Excessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits. This can be carried out in a number of ways: making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley’s procedure) the sweat glands using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands These procedures are generally carried out under local anaesthetic , which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed. ",,"Complications of hyperhidrosis About hyperhidrosis Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively. The sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas. Commonly affected areas include the: armpits palms of your hands soles of your feet face and chest groin Both sides of the body are usually affected equally – for example, both feet or both hands. The sweating doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to feelings of depression and anxiety . Read more about the complications of hyperhidrosis . What is excessive sweating? There are no guidelines to determine what “normal” sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis. For example, you may have hyperhidrosis if: you avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands, because you feel self-conscious about your sweating you don’t take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse excessive sweating is interfering with your job – for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard you’re having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving you’re spending a significant amount of time coping with sweating – for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious When to see your GP Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively. Also visit your GP if you are having night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. wearing loose and light clothes avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse wearing black or white clothes to help minimise the signs of sweating Read more about . Who is affected Hyperhidrosis is common. It’s been estimated to affect between 1 and 3 in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK. Hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty. Lifestyle changes Possible side effects of anticholinergics include a dry mouth , blurred vision, stomach cramps, constipation and difficulty passing urine. Referral to a dermatologist Iontophoresis Iontophoresis may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective. Alternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of £250-500. Botulinum toxin injections Botulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands. Around 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total. Potential side effects of botulinum toxin injections include: pain, redness or itching where the injections are given nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area – known as compensatory sweating Most of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off. Surgery and other procedures Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It’s usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits. Small incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic and done on both sides of the body. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain: ETS carries a risk of serious complications (see below) Read the full NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb . Side effects and complications of ETS can also include: sweating of the face and neck after eating food – this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure bleeding into the chest during surgery air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties These procedures don’t work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn’t always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness. Feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle. You may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse. If your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) might help. Medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse. Complications of hyperhidrosis Hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems. Fungal infections Hyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly on the feet – most commonly fungal nail infections and athlete’s foot. This is because excessive sweat combined with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow. Fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. More severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules. Skin conditions Excessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to certain skin conditions, such as: warts – small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the HPV virus boils – swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infected Eczema can also be made worse by excessive sweating. Body odour Although people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don’t have problems with body odour. This is because hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat – called the aprocrine sweat glands. However, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. Eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell. This can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat. See for more information. Emotional impact The emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. Many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. Signs that you may be depressed include: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month having little interest or pleasure in things during the past month It is important not to neglect your mental health. Make an appointment to see your GP if you think that you may be depressed. Read more about depression or find out more about tackling stress, anxiety and depression. ",
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/hypoglycaemia-low-blood-sugar/,Introduction ,"Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness. It’s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking. Read more about the Correcting hypoglycaemia Missing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. You should be careful when drinking alcohol as it can also cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking. Exercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose. You should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it’s injected. Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency. When hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo. Read more about preventing hypoglycaemia If you have diabetes , particularly if it’s treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to regularly check your blood glucose levels. feeling hungry sweating dizziness tiredness (fatigue) blurred vision trembling or shakiness going pale fast pulse or palpitations tingling lips irritability difficulty concentrating confusion disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness If hypoglycaemia isn’t treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness. headache – often likened to having a hangover feeling unusually tired in the morning damp sheets or clothing from sweating Preventing hypoglycaemia If you have diabetes, sticking to your medication plan and eating regular meals can help prevent hypoglycaemia. It’s also important to monitor your blood glucose levels. Monitoring blood glucose Regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels can help you keep your blood glucose as normal and stable as possible, and will help you spot the quickly. so you can treat it quickly. Tell your family and friends about the signs to look out for and let them know how to treat it. People with diabetes are advised to carry a form of identification with them that states their condition so they can be helped quickly and efficiently. If you experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you can try: keeping something sugary by your bedside having a snack before bedtime, such as biscuits and milk checking your blood glucose levels between 3am and 4am, when hypoglycaemia is most likely to occur Hypoglycaemia and driving As hypoglycaemia can cause confusion, drowsiness, or even unconsciousness, this can present a significant risk to you or other road users. See the GOV.UK website for more information about hypoglycaemia and driving ","You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: a glucagon injection kit isn’t available there’s nobody trained to give the injection the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s drowsy or unconscious as they could choke. This includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek. Read more about In most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people with diabetes , although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions. Hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes Overdose of diabetes medication A common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. Insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. It’s commonly used to treat type 1 diabetes and is also recommended for some people with type 2 diabetes . Exercise, food and alcohol For people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing how much insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise. Hypoglycaemia may occur if you’ve taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. This may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don’t eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual. People with diabetes who’ve drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia. However, it’s not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason. Hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes Reactive hypoglycaemia People without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. This is known as reactive hypoglycaemia. It’s not clear why this happens, although it’s thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery. In rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose. fasting or malnutrition – where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly binge drinking or heavy drinking of alcohol Addison’s disease – a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys) certain medication – hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (for malaria ), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (for high blood pressure ) severe illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid gland ",,"Preventing hypoglycaemia Introduction Hypoglycaemia, or a “hypo”, is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre). When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn’t have enough energy to carry out its activities. Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes , and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard. In rare cases, it’s possible for a person who doesn’t have diabetes to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition , binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison’s disease . Read more about the After having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting “starchy” carbohydrate food, such as a sandwich or a few biscuits. Preventing hypoglycaemia Read more about how hypoglycaemia is treated Hypoglycaemia while sleeping Having a hypo while you’re asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It’s more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin. For example, this could be: a glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink between three and five dextrose tablets a handful of sweets At first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don’t usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly. After having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich. It will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. If it’s still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing your levels again in another 15 to 20 minutes. It may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. This shouldn’t be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking. If you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. Your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated. If a person is unconscious If a person loses consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into the recovery position and given an injection of the hormone glucagon (if they have an injection kit). The injection will raise their blood glucose level. The injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they’re doing, or by a trained healthcare professional. You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: a glucagon injection kit isn’t available there’s nobody available who’s trained to give the injection the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s unconscious as they could choke. If you’re able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich. You can monitor your blood glucose levels using a blood glucose meter, a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. Read more about living with type 1 diabetes and living with type 2 diabetes Food and alcohol If you have diabetes, strenuous physical activity can lead to hypoglycaemia. Eating extra carbohydrate-based foods before and during exercise can help reduce the chances of this happening. If you’re taking insulin, your doctor may advise you to lower your dose before you do strenuous physical activity. Alcohol can also affect your body’s ability to release glucose. If you have type 1 diabetes , it’s recommended that you drink no more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day and eat a snack after drinking alcohol. Spotting the signs As hypoglycaemia can develop suddenly, it’s important to be aware of the If you’re at risk of hypoglycaemia, you should carry sugary food and drink with you at all times to treat mild cases as soon as possible. If you’re being treated with insulin, you’ll usually be given a kit that contains an injection of a medication called glucagon. Family members or your carer can be trained to carry out the injection, which should be used if you lose consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia. Preventing hypoglycaemia at night inform the DVLA and your insurance company test your blood sugar before driving and at regular intervals (at least every two hours) while driving avoid driving if your blood glucose is low carry rapid-acting carbohydrates with you in the vehicle at all times If you experience hypoglycaemia while driving, pull over and stop as soon as it’s safe to do so. Remove the keys from the ignition and get out of the driver’s seat before in the normal way. If you have two or more episodes of hypoglycaemia that require assistance in a 12-month period, it’s a legal requirement to stop driving and inform the DVLA. If you’re a group two driver (you hold a licence to drive buses, coaches or lorries), you’re legally required to stop driving group two vehicles immediately and inform the DVLA if you have a single episode of hypoglycaemia that requires assistance.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/,About idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ,"shortness of breath a persistent dry cough tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers) Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath. When to get medical advice See your GP if you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than three weeks. If your GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as: breathing (lung function) tests blood tests a chest X-ray and computerised tomography (CT) scan a lung biopsy (where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed) Read more about the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Other problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections , pulmonary hypertension and heart failure . The most common symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is shortness of breath, often when physically active, which can get worse over time. At first, many people ignore their breathlessness (especially older patients) and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But as the disease progresses and lung damage becomes more severe, even light activity like getting dressed or having a shower can cause breathlessness. a persistent dry cough tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss In up to half of all cases, there is also a change in the shape of the finger and toenails. This thickening of tissue at the base of the finger and toenails is known as digital clubbing. The exact cause of clubbing is unknown, but it can occur in people with various chest and heart diseases. Secondary conditions The strain IPF can place on your lungs and your heart can trigger a number of secondary conditions, outlined below. Chest infection You will have an increased risk of developing chest and airway infections such as: bronchitis – an infection of the airway of the lungs pneumonia – an infection of the air sacs of your lungs influenza (flu) worsening breathlessness chest pain a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above sweating and shivering Pulmonary hypertension Around a third of people with IPF will also go on to develop pulmonary hypertension . Pulmonary hypertension is when blood pressure inside the arteries connecting the lungs to the heart is dangerously high. dizziness feeling faint chest pain (angina) a racing heartbeat (tachycardia) Read more about . Heart failure Heart failure , where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body, can develop when IPF becomes severe. This is due to a combination of factors, including a build-up of blood in the right side of the heart (the side that pumps blood to the lungs), which develops because it is difficult to pump blood through the scarred lung tissue. The poor supply of oxygen from the diseased lungs to the heart muscle also contributes to heart failure. worsening breathlessness extreme tiredness and weakness swelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema) caused by a build-up of fluid Read more about the . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . If IPF is suspected, the chest x-ray will be followed by a computerised tomography (CT) scan . A CT scan is similar to an X-ray, but lots more images are taken and these are put together by a computer to create a more detailed image of your lungs. This can help your doctor spot signs of scarring in your lungs. Bronchoscopy If doctors still aren’t sure what the problem is after the tests described above, they may suggest having a bronchoscopy. This is a test where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera (bronchoscope) is passed down into your airways. Your doctor can then look for anything abnormal and can take small tissue samples for testing. You’ll usually be awake for a bronchoscopy and it may cause coughing. Local anaesthetic will be used to numb your throat so it doesn’t hurt and you may also be given a sedative injection which will make you feel sleepy during the procedure. Lung biopsy If other tests aren’t conclusive, a lung biopsy may need to be carried out. This involves keyhole surgery to remove a small sample of lung tissue so it can be analysed for signs of scarring. The procedure is performed under a general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep). Your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your side and an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera and a light at the end) is inserted into the area between the lungs and the chest wall. The surgeon can see the lung tissue through the endoscope and is able obtain a small sample. This is called palliative care. You can choose to receive palliative care: at home in a care home in hospital in a hospice Your doctor or care team should work with you to establish a clear plan based on your wishes. For further information see End of life care . ","Diagnosing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The reason this happens isn’t clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown. IPF has been linked to: exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust viral infections a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) smoking But it’s not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF. The exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is not known. Idiopathic means having no known cause. The current theory is that IPF is triggered when cells that line the lung alveoli (air sacs) become damaged by exposure to one of several substances or viruses. The damaged cells try to repair themselves but the process becomes uncontrolled, resulting in thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue. The amount of oxygen that can pass from the lungs into the blood is then significantly reduced. Triggers A number of factors have been suggested as possible triggers for the initial damage to the cells lining the alveoli. Most experts agree that the two most significant risk factors are: being a smoker or having smoked in the past occupational exposure to certain types of dust – jobs that involve working with wood, metal, textile, stone, cattle or farming may increase the risk of IPF Other possible risk factors include: viral infections – such as the Epstein-Barr virus or hepatitis C gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) (where the acid from your stomach rises back up into your throat) – this may be accidentally inhaled into the lungs, causing damage to the alveoli chronic aspiration – where food, drink or saliva enter the lungs and is not coughed back up, often due to a related condition environmental pollutants or dust genetic tendency – the condition appears to run in some families but this only seems to be the case in around 5% of people with IPF As IPF is such a rare condition it is hard to estimate how much of an impact these risk factors can have on your chance of developing it. Diagnosing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ","The checks and tests you may have include: Medical history and examination Breathing and blood tests Chest X-ray and CT scan Bronchoscopy Lung biopsy Medical history and examination Your doctor will ask about your medical history and whether there are other factors that could be causing a problem with your lungs, such as whether you: smoke or have smoked in the past have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos have other medical conditions They may also: check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis) look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing) ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless Breathing and blood tests Lung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests) assess how well your lungs work and can help indicate what the problem may be. These tests measure: how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs how much air your lungs can hold how well your lungs transfer oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from it (this can be checked using a blood test ) A commonly used lung function test is spirometry. During the test, you breathe into a mouthpiece that’s attached to a monitor. Chest X-ray and CT scan A chest X-ray ","About idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult. self-care measures – such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly medication to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens – such as pirfenidone and nintedanib breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you’re at home and/or while you’re out and about pulmonary rehabilitation – exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare Read more about how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated . Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable. Self-care Medication Oxygen support Pulmonary rehabilitation Lung transplant As the condition becomes more advanced, end of life (palliative) care will be offered. Self-care There are several things you can do to stay as healthy as possible if you have IPF. These include: stopping smoking if you smoke exercise regularly and stay as fit as you can eat a healthy, balanced diet make sure you get the annual flu jab and one-off pneumococcal vaccination – these infections can be more serious if you have a lung condition try to keep away from people with chest infections and colds whenever possible Medication There are two medications that can help slow down the progression of IPF in some people: pirfenidone and nintedanib. Some people also take a medication called N-acetylcysteine, although its benefits are uncertain. Pirfenidone Pirfenidone helps to slow the development of scarring in the lungs by reducing the activity of the immune system. It’s normally taken as capsules three times a day. It’s recommended if breathing tests have shown your lung capacity is 50-80% of what would normally be expected. If your condition gets worse despite taking pirfenidone and your lung capacity falls by 10% or more within a year, the medication will usually be stopped. Side effects of pirfenidone can include: feeling sick tiredness diarrhoea indigestion a rash caused by exposure to sunlight For further information see, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Nintedanib Nintedanib is a newer medication that can also help slow down scarring of the lungs in some people with IPF. It’s normally taken as capsules twice a day. Like pirfenidone, it may be used if you have a lung capacity 50-80% of what would normally be expected and should be stopped if your lung capacity falls by 10% or more in a year while taking it. Side effects of nintedanib can include: diarrhoea feeling and being sick abdominal (tummy) pain loss of appetite and weight loss For further information, see the NICE guidelines on nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . N-acetylcysteine N-acetylcysteine is what’s known as an antioxidant. It’s available from many health shops and is usually taken as tablets. There is some limited evidence to suggest it may reduce the amount of scar tissue in the lungs, although other studies have not shown any benefit. If you’re considering taking N-acetylcysteine, you should check with your specialist first as it may not be safe or suitable for everyone with IPF. Oxygen support IPF can cause levels of oxygen in your blood fall, which can make you feel more breathless. Oxygen is taken through nasal tubes or a mask attached to a small machine. This device provides a much higher level of oxygen than the air. The tubes from the machine are long, so you’ll be able to move around your home while connected. Read further about . Portable oxygen devices that you can use while you’re out and about are also available. Pulmonary rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation is used for many long-term lung conditions and aims to help patients come to terms with their condition, learn the best ways to deal with it and improve their ability to function on a daily basis without severe breathlessness. Courses in pulmonary rehabilitation are usually held locally and may involve: education about pulmonary fibrosis physical activity breathing exercises advice on nutrition psychological support a social support network Lung transplant lung transplant . The decision to have a transplant will be based on: how bad your condition is how quickly your condition is getting worse your age and general health how much your condition is likely to improve after a transplant whether a donor lung is available A lung transplant can significantly improve life expectancy in people with IPF, although it’s a major procedure that puts a great strain on the body. Few people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are suitable candidates for a transplant and donor lungs are scarce. Palliative care ",
Impetigo,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/impetigo/,About impetigo ,"There are 2 types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo – the most common type bullous impetigo Non-bullous impetigo The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren’t painful, but they may be itchy. It’s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. swollen glands , are rare but can occur in more severe cases. Bullous impetigo The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it’s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.

Antibiotic tablets Common side effects of oral antibiotics include: feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea If your doctor thinks you may keep getting impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria. Complications of impetigo Cellulitis Cellulitis Guttate psoriasis Guttate psoriasis is a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. It is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo. Scarlet fever Scarlet fever Scarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. Therefore, it’s important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. Keep your child away from school and other people until they have been taking antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Septicaemia Septicaemia (a type of sepsis ) is a bacterial infection of the blood. It can cause: diarrhoea cold, clammy skin a high temperature (fever) rapid breathing vomiting low blood pressure (hypotension) confusion feeling faint and dizzy losing consciousness painful skin a high temperature (fever) large areas of skin peeling off or falling away redness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire body a change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour swelling of the abdomen (tummy), face, eyes, feet and ankles a rise in blood pressure visible blood in your urine a reduction in the amount of urine you would normally produce ","Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can infect the skin in 2 main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a cut , insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice , scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. If you’re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. Complications of impetigo guttate psoriasis – a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type of sepsis ) – a bacterial infection of the blood Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required. chemotherapy – are most at risk of developing impetigo. antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. Read about . Preventing the spread of impetigo The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: do not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they’re seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible. Preventing recurrent impetigo Increased risk In addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. These include: being a child – impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries having diabetes being a carrier of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria – these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby warm and humid weather – impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the UK, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year having a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such as HIV chemotherapy If impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics . If the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema , this may also need to be treated. Antibiotic cream For mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied 3 or 4 times a day for 7 days. Before applying the cream, wash any affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed. To reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it’s also important that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream. Side effects of antibiotic cream can include: irritation redness itchiness in the area where the cream is applied In these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab of the affected skin themselves for testing. Scarring In rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. However, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. The blisters and crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal. The red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. It’s a very rare complication of impetigo. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare. Preventing impetigo As impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading. Stopping the infection spreading To help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body you should: not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible avoid touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible not scratch the affected areas – it may help to ensure your or your child’s nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching wash your hands frequently, particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed, and wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they contact their pharmacist as soon as possible.

",pain if pressure is placed on the toe inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy) bleeding white or yellow pus coming from the affected area When to get professional advice Partial nail avulsion ,"A number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including: badly cut toenails – cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights – this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it’s pressed on to your toenail sweaty feet – if the skin around your toenails is soft, it’s easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it injury – for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop natural shape of the nail – the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail A fungal nail infection can cause your toenail to thicken or widen. ",,"Find your local pharmacy on Scotland’s Service directory. Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it’s important that you: keep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water change your socks regularly cut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin gently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin) wear comfortable shoes that fit properly A local anaesthetic is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future. A course of antibiotics may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away. Total nail avulsion Total nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you’ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it’s perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail. After surgery After toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1 to 2 days after the operation. To help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol , and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery. Preventing ingrown toenails Taking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It’s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges). Wash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin. Wearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day. Visit your GP or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet. ",
Inherited heart conditions,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/inherited-heart-conditions/,"An inherited heart disease is one which has been passed on through your parents’ genes. Inherited cardiac conditions (ICC) is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of relatively rare diseases of the heart. They are also referred to as genetic cardiac conditions. ICCs are caused by a fault – also known as a mutation – in one or more of our genes. If someone has a faulty gene, there’s a 50/50 chance it can be passed on to your children. The effects of these conditions on you and your family can be enormous. These conditions can – in some cases – become life-threatening. Around 500 young people die every year in the UK as a result of a genetic heart disorder. ","palpitations fainting or blackouts (also known as syncope or “near” faint) The majority of children and young adults with syncope have a normal heart disease and no major heart rhythm problem. However, it’s really important to speak to your GP or health professional if you – or a member of your family – have suffered unexplained fainting, especially if it’s happened more than once. Different inherited heart conditions Familial cardiomyopathies These include: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) idiopathic or familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) restrictive cardiomyopathy Familial arrhythmias These include: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) Brugada syndrome Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) Marfan syndrome Marfan syndrome is an inherited – or genetic – condition that affects the body’s connective tissues. Connective tissues provide support and structure to other tissue and organs. There is a 50/50 chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will have a child with the condition, but Marfan syndrome is relatively rare – around 1 in 5,000 people have the syndrome.

Read more about the . Why it happens Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications. Read more about the Search for a pharmacy near you Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: you are 55 years old or over you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to you have increasing difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you have iron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stools stomach ulcer or stomach cancer . You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause. An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. Read more about the possible complications of severe indigestion . The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own. Heartburn is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus). feeling uncomfortably full or heavy belching or flatulence (passing wind) bringing food or fluid back up from your stomach (reflux) bloating feeling sick (nausea) vomiting Read some relaxation tips to relieve stress. Hiatus hernia A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall. A hiatus hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs). It may partially block refluxed stomach acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn. Helicobacter pylori infection Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Stomach ulcers A stomach ulcer is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom. Stomach ulcers form when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection. Stomach cancer In rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of stomach cancer . Cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall. Diagnosing indigestion any medication you are taking – as some medications can cause indigestion your lifestyle – as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion Further investigations Endoscopy You may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a TV monitor. An endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if: they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail Taking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Read more about a stool antigen test – a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria a breath test a blood test – a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection) Antibiotics and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and 4 weeks after you last used an antibiotic. Diagnosing other conditions For example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working. You may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.

Changing current medication Your pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion. As long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first. Immediate indigestion relief If you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend: antacid medicines alginates Antacids Antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription. The effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much. after meals at bedtime This is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes. Read more about antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects. Alginates Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. Take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) H2-receptor antagonists Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) food that becomes lodged in your throat chest pain Oesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus. Pyloric stenosis Like oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid. The concern is that Barrett’s oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. This means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into cancer in the future. This would then trigger the onset of oesophageal cancer . ","Diagnosing indigestion . It’s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus). Indigestion can also be triggered or made worse by other factors. Medications You may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up. Other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), can affect your digestive tract and cause indigestion. Do not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a stomach ulcer , or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care. Obesity If you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen). The increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus. Stress or anxiety If you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on losing weight . Stop smoking If you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux. Read more about quitting smoking , or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also phone the Quit Your Way Scotland service on 0800 84 84 84. Diet and alcohol Make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine – such as tea, coffee and cola avoiding or cutting down on alcohol At bedtime In most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width. Barrett’s oesophagus Repeated episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus. ",,"Complications of indigestion About indigestion Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn).

Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required. When to get professional advice you have any . Your GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care. Diagnosing H pylori infection Diet and lifestyle changes Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) PPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach. warfarin – a medicine that stops the blood clotting phenytoin – a medicine to treat epilepsy If your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP. If your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy. PPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include: headaches diarrhoea constipation feeling sick (nausea) vomiting flatulence stomach pain dizziness skin rashes H2-receptor antagonists H2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists: cimetidine famotidine nizatidine ranitidine These medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach. Your GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form. As with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP.

Complications of indigestion In most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. However, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below. Oesophageal stricture Indigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. If this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. The scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture). ",

Read more self-help tips for insomnia When to see your GP Make an appointment to see your GP if you’re finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it’s affecting your daily life – particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped. Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise. They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia. Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns. Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night. Insomnia can be triggered by a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use. Sometimes it’s not possible to identify a clear cause. Stress and anxiety Some people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties. The problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. This develops into an anxiety about sleep itself. Having more general worries – for example, about work, family or health – are also likely to keep you awake at night. These can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep. Poor sleep routine and sleeping environment You may struggle to get a good night’s sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don’t “wind down” before going to bed. A poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia – for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that’s too bright, noisy, hot or cold. Lifestyle factors Drinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). These should be avoided in the evenings. Changes to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia – for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag). Mental health conditions Underlying mental health problems can often affect a person’s sleeping patterns, including: mood disorders – such as depression or bipolar disorder anxiety disorders– such as generalised anxiety, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder psychotic disorders – such as schizophrenia Physical health conditions Insomnia can also be caused by underlying physical conditions, including: heart conditions – such as angina or heart failure respiratory conditions – such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma neurological conditions – such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease hormonal problems – such as an overactive thyroid joint or muscle problems – such as arthritis problems with the genital or urinary organs – such as urinary incontinence or an enlarged prostate sleep disorders – such as snoring and sleep apnoea , restless legs syndrome , narcolepsy, night terrors and sleepwalking long-term pain In women, childbirth can sometimes lead to insomnia. Medication Some prescriptions or over-the-counter medications can cause insomnia as a side effect. These include: certain antidepressants epilepsy medicines medicines for high blood pressure , such as beta-blockers steroid medication non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) stimulant medicines used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or narcolepsy some medicines used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline Check the leaflet that comes with any medication you’re taking to see if insomnia or sleeping difficulties are listed as a possible side effect. Self-help tips Insomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment. Making small changes may help you to get a good night’s sleep. Try some of the methods below for a few weeks to see if they help. See your GP if you’re still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques. Daytime habits Set a specific time for getting up each day. Try to stick to this time, seven days a week, even if you feel you haven’t had enough sleep. This should help you sleep better at night. Don’t take a nap during the day. Take daily exercise, such as 30 minutes walking or cycling . But don’t exercise for at least four hours before going to bed, because this may make it more difficult to fall asleep. Bedtime habits Stop drinking tea and coffee for a few hours before bedtime. Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking, particularly shortly before going to bed. Don’t eat a big meal just before bedtime. Only go to bed when you’re feeling tired. If necessary, go to bed later than usual if it means you might be able to fall asleep more quickly. Don’t use back-lit devices shortly before going to bed, including televisions, phones, tablets and computers. Try to create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, listening to soft music, and drinking a warm, milky drink every night. These activities will be associated with sleep and will cause drowsiness. Avoid regularly using over-the-counter sleeping tablets. It is not clear how effective these are, they don’t tackle the underlying problem, and have potential side effects. Read more about Taking OTC sleeping tablets regularly isn’t usually recommended if you have insomnia, because it’s not clear how effective they are, they don’t tackle the underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties and they can cause side effects. In particular, they can cause you to feel drowsy the next morning, which can make activities such as driving and operating machinery dangerous. Speak to your GP for advice if you find yourself needing to take OTC sleeping tablets regularly. Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines are prescription medicines that can reduce anxiety and promote calmness, relaxation and sleep. Your GP may prescribe them for a short time if you have severe insomnia or it’s causing extreme distress. Examples of benzodiazepines include temazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam. ",,"Introduction Insomnia is difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep for long enough to feel refreshed the next morning. It’s a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people. If you have insomnia, you may: find it difficult to fall asleep lie awake for long periods at night wake up several times during the night wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep not feel refreshed when you get up find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating Occasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you’re able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues. How much sleep do I need? There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. On average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. What’s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality. You’re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it’s affecting your everyday life. Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems. They’ll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep. In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended. Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time. This is because they don’t treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time. Read more about . Don’t lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. Instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again. Avoid watching the clock because it will only make you anxious about how long it’s taking you to fall asleep. Write a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. This may help you forget about them until the morning. Bedroom environment Use thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep. Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping. Wear ear plugs if noise is a problem. Don’t use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. Avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you’re in bed. Make sure your mattress is comfortable and that you have a pillow you like, as well as adequate bedding for the time of year. Good sleeping habits Your GP will be able to advise you about what you can do at home to help you sleep. This is known as “sleep hygiene” and includes: establishing fixed times for going to bed and waking up creating a relaxing bedtime routine only going to bed when you feel tired maintaining a comfortable sleeping environment that’s not too hot, cold, noisy or bright not napping during the day avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late at night avoiding eating a heavy meal late at night Read more about self-help tips for insomnia If changing your sleeping habits doesn’t help, your GP may be able to refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that’s specifically designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I). CBT-I may include: stimulus-control therapy – which aims to help you associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern sleep restriction therapy – limiting the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves relaxation training – aims to reduce tension or minimise intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep paradoxical intention – you try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep; it’s used if you have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep biofeedback – sensors connected to a machine are placed on your body to measure your body’s functions, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help you recognise when you’re not relaxed CBT-I is sometimes carried out by a specially trained GP. Alternatively, you may be referred to a clinical psychologist. The therapy may be carried out in a small group with other people who have similar sleep problems, or one-to-one with a therapist. Self-help books and online courses may also be used. Sleeping tablets Sleeping tablets (hypnotics) are medications that encourage sleep. In the past, they were frequently used to help with insomnia, but they’re used much less often nowadays. They will generally only be considered: if your insomnia is severe as a temporary measure to help ease short-term insomnia They can also cause a number of side effects, including: drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day finding it difficult to concentrate or make decisions depression feeling emotionally numb irritability You should avoid driving if you feel drowsy, dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions, as you may not be able to do so safely. Z-drugs Z–drugs are a newer type of medicine that work in a similar way to benzodiazepines and are similarly effective. They include zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone. They’re usually only prescribed for a maximum of two to four weeks. Side effects of Z-drugs can include: drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day feeling and being sick diarrhoea increased snoring and breathing problems during sleep dry mouth confusion Z–drugs can also sometimes cause psychiatric reactions, such as delusions, nightmares and hallucinations. Contact your GP if you experience any of these effects. Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomnia for more information. Melatonin (Circadin) For adults aged 55 or over, a medication called Circadin is sometimes used to help relieve insomnia for a few weeks. It contains a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the sleep cycle. Circadin is usually only recommended for three weeks at first, but it can be continued for a total of 13 weeks if it helps. Common side effects of Circadin include: headaches antidepressants (unless you also have depression) chloral hydrate clomethiazole barbiturates herbal remedies, such as valerian extract complementary and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy and reflexology ",

Germ cell tumours,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/germ-cell-tumours/,Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured. ,"How germ cell tumours are diagnosed Different tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a biopsy ) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not. CT or MRI scans may be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. Chest X-rays may be taken to see if there’s a tumour in the lungs. ",,,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Germ cell tumours can appear at any age. They develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. However, it’s possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body. As a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. However, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. The most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen. Germ cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. These include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas. They may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs. Immature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. They can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation. Staging Generally cancer is divided into 4 stages: stage 1 – the cancer is small, has not spread and has been completely removed stages 2 and 3 – the cancer is larger and may not have been completely removed, or may have spread to nearby organs stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. A benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. It may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started. If the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery, chemotherapy is not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. If the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. It’s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. A combination of drugs is usually given every 3 weeks for 3 or 5 months. The length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of AFP, and whether or not the tumour has spread. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. Unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it’s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery. feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoea Late side effects If your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they’ll usually still be able to have children in the future. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support support your child. ",

Read more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia Gastrointestinal cancer In a few cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually stomach cancer or bowel cancer . When trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer. , such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations. Physical examination In such cases, your GP may: examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding look for signs of heart failure Two other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below. Rectal examination A rectal examination is usually only needed if you’re bleeding from your bottom. It’s a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there’s something in your gastrointestinal tract that’s causing bleeding. Your GP will insert a lubricated gloved finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities. A rectal examination isn’t something to be embarrassed about, as it’s a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn’t cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort – this will only last for a minute. Pelvic examination Women may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia. During a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection. They may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your womb (uterus) is tender or enlarged. A pelvic examination won’t be carried out without your consent (permission), and you can choose to have someone with you. Referral to a specialist stomach cancer or bowel cancer , although this is unlikely. ","Diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines. This can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer , bowel cancer , or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you’re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above. Read more about the How iron deficiency anaemia is treated Iron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn’t have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Monthly periods In women of reproductive age, periods are the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. Usually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it’s known as menorrhagia. Pregnancy It’s also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy. This is because your body needs extra iron to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients. Some pregnant women require an iron supplement, while others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet. Read more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy Gastrointestinal blood loss The gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who’ve experienced the menopause (when monthly periods stop). Most people with gastrointestinal bleeding don’t notice any obvious blood in their stools and don’t experience any changes in their bowel habits. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause bleeding in the stomach. Ibuprofen and aspirin are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs. If your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don’t stop taking a medicine you’ve been prescribed unless your GP advises you to. Stomach ulcers The acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a stomach ulcer or a peptic ulcer. Other conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis oesophagitis – inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus) caused by stomach acid leaking through it schistosomiasis – an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa blood donation – donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia trauma – a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood nosebleeds – having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although this is rare Malabsorption Malabsorption is when your body can’t absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This may happen if you have coeliac disease , a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy). Lack of iron in your diet Unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet. However, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above. Some studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet. If you are vegetarian or vegan, it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as: beans nuts dried fruit, such as dried apricots wholegrains, such as brown rice fortified breakfast cereals soybean flour most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale If you’re pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia. Read more about vegetarian and vegan diets Diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia See your GP if you experience Some common complications are outlined below. Tiredness Iron deficiency anaemia can make you feel tired and lacking in energy (lethargic). This may result in you being less productive at work, and you may find it difficult to stay awake or not feel able to exercise regularly. Increased risk of infections Research has shown iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system – the body’s natural defence system. This increases your vulnerability to infection. Heart and lung problems Adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs. For example, you may develop tachycardia , which is an abnormally fast heartbeat, or heart failure , where the heart fails to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure. Pregnancy complications Pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after birth. They may also develop postnatal depression , which some women experience after having a baby. Research suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to: be born prematurely – before the 37th week of pregnancy have a low birth weight have problems with iron levels themselves do less well in mental ability tests Restless legs syndrome Some cases of restless legs syndrome are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. Doctors often refer to this as secondary restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome caused by iron deficiency anaemia can usually be treated with iron supplements. ","Your GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia. Blood test To diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count is made. This means all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured. If you have anaemia: your levels of haemoglobin – a substance that transports oxygen – will be lower than normal you’ll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual Your GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn’t much iron stored in your body and you may have iron deficiency anaemia. Read more about blood tests Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency If your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia is more common in people who are over the age of 75. Finding the cause To determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about: your diet – to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods any medicines you take – to see if you’ve been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as ibuprofen or aspirin your menstrual pattern – if you’re a woman, your GP may ask if you’ve been experiencing particularly heavy periods your family history – you’ll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders ","Complications of iron deficiency anaemia About iron deficiency anaemia Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won’t get as much oxygen as they usually would. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type. Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body – read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia . The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don’t get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended. Good sources of iron include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice pulses and beans nuts and seeds meat, fish and tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins Read more about Further problems If iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the body’s natural defence system (the immune system). Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure , where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure. Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth. Read more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia If you’re 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP should refer you to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your  appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you. Angiodysplasia Gastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is the result of abnormal, fragile superficial blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. Chronic kidney disease People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often develop iron deficiency anaemia. Most people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets may be tried first. You can read more about on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. Iron supplements Your GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, which is taken as a tablet, usually twice a day. Some people can experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including: abdominal (tummy) pain constipation or diarrhoea heartburn feeling sick black stools (faeces) These side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects. Your GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you’re finding side effects difficult to cope with. If you can’t take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate. This supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored. In a few cases – for example, if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD) – iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets. As with all medications, it’s important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal. Dietary advice If a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake. Iron-rich foods include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice pulses and beans nuts and seeds white and red meat fish tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins Your diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it’s healthy and balanced. In particular, food and drink containing vitamin C are important as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. However, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain medicines, may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include: tea and coffee calcium – found in dairy products, such as milk antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – medications used to relieve indigestion wholegrain cereals – although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills You may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you’re finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They’ll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can improve your diet. Your GP will also need to ensure the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so it doesn’t happen again. For example, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding. Heavy periods can be treated with medication or – in particularly severe cases – surgery. Monitoring blood test to check your haemoglobin levels. If your blood test results show an improvement, you’ll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four months for another blood test. Once your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body. After this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later. Sometimes after a person’s iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again. This could happen if you don’t get enough iron in your diet, you’re pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods. In such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you’ll have to take once a day. If your iron levels don’t improve, your GP will ask how regularly you’ve been taking your iron supplements. Some people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won’t improve if you don’t take the supplements. If you’ve been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven’t improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment. Complications of iron deficiency anaemia ",

Kaposi’s sarcoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/kaposis-sarcoma/,"Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare type of cancer caused by a virus. It can affect the skin and internal organs. It’s mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe HIV infection. It can also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. ","The most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They’re usually red or purple and look similar to bruises. Over time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other. uncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs (lymphoedema) breathlessness , coughing up blood and chest pain nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhoea When to seek medical advice These tests may include: an HIV test – a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven’t already been diagnosed with the condition) a skin biopsy – where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and checked for Kaposi’s sarcoma cells an endoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see if your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected Classic Kaposi’s sarcoma Classic Kaposi’s sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in the UK are Ashkenazi Jews. It’s thought people who develop classic Kaposi’s sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus. ","Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth. HHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi’s sarcoma. It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus. A weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi’s sarcoma. The virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours. ",,"There are 4 main types of Kaposi’s sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways. HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma Although it’s not as common as it used to be, Kaposi’s sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV. HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication – known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) – to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body. Read more about . radiotherapy (where high-energy rays are used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant. It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again. Transplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It’s normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used. Endemic African Kaposi’s sarcoma Endemic African Kaposi’s sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region. In cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi’s sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used. Outlook A complete cure for any type of Kaposi’s sarcoma isn’t always possible, and there’s a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible. ",
Kidney stones,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/kidneys-bladder-and-prostate/kidney-stones/,About kidney stones ,"Small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. But it’s fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the: ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body . Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly. Read more about gets stuck in your kidney starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder) – the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can cause pain as they try to pass through a persistent ache in the lower back, which is sometimes also felt in the groin – men may have pain in their testicles and scrotum periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which may last for minutes or hours feeling restless and unable to lie still nausea (feeling sick) needing to urinate more often than normal pain when you urinate (dysuria) blood in your urine (haematuria) – this may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter Blocked ureter and kidney infection A kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria. The a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over chills and shivering feeling very weak or tired diarrhoea cloudy and bad-smelling urine Read more about kidney infections . It will be particularly easy if you’ve had kidney stones before. You may be given tests, including: urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine blood tests to check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calcium You can collect a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking. You may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home. Self care You may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking. you’re dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down you’re pregnant you’re over 60 years of age a blocked ureter – caused by stone fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder an injury to the ureter a urinary tract infection bleeding during surgery pain It’s estimated that 5% to 9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy. Preventing kidney stones The best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated. Keeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones. You can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour. The darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is. Your urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight. Drinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing. You should also make sure you drink more when it’s hot or when you’re exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating. Read more about preventing dehydration . Diet If your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet. Oxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone. Foods that contain oxalates include: beetroot asparagus rhubarb chocolate berries leeks parsley celery almonds, peanuts and cashew nuts soy products grains, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and wholewheat Don’t reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your GP advises you to. This is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth. To avoid developing a uric acid stone, you should reduce the amount of meat, poultry and fish in your diet. You may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine. Medication If you have a kidney stone, medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing. However, some medication may need to be reviewed by your GP if it’s thought to be causing your kidney stone. The type of medication your GP prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have. For example, if you have: calcium stones – you may be prescribed a diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria (an inherited condition) struvite stones – you may be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent a urinary tract infection or kidney infection ","Diagnosing kidney stones urinary tract infection (UTI) . Read more about the The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. This is more likely to happen if you don’t drink enough fluids, if you’re taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine. Read more about the . After a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder). Kidney stones are usually formed following a build-up of certain chemicals in the body. This build-up may be any of the following: calcium ammonia uric acid – a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy cysteine – an amino acid that helps to build protein Certain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine. You’re also more likely to develop kidney stones if you don’t drink enough fluids. Recurrent kidney stones Some people are particularly likely to keep on developing kidney stones, including people who: eat a high-protein, low-fibre diet are inactive or bed-bound have a family history of kidney stones have had several kidney or urinary infections have had a kidney stone before, particularly if it was before you were 25 have only one fully working kidney have had an intestinal bypass (surgery on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such as Crohn’s disease Medication There’s evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. These include: aspirin antacids diuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up) certain antibiotics certain antiretroviral medication (used to treat HIV ) certain anti-epileptic medication Types of kidney stones Kidney stones can develop for a number of reasons. Calcium stones Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there’s too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to: an inherited condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to large amounts of calcium in urine an overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body) kidney disease a rare condition called sarcoidosis some cancers Calcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough. Struvite stones Struvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after a urinary tract infection that’s lasted a long time. Struvite stones are more common in women than men. Uric acid stones Uric acid stones can form if there’s a large amount of acid in your urine. They may be caused by: eating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat a condition such as gout that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals chemotherapy Cystine stones Cystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. They’re caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine. Diagnosing kidney stones uric acid stones – you may be prescribed allopurinol (a medication used to lower uric acid levels) and medication to help alkalise your urine cystine stones – you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in your urine ",These tests include: a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together X-ray – an imaging technique that uses high-energy radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue an ultrasound scan – uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body an intravenous urogram (IVU) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) – a dye that shows up on X-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the X-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your urine CT scans are now often used because they’re thought to be more accurate. IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method. The imaging technique you have may depend on what’s available at your local hospital. ,"Preventing kidney stones About kidney stones Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60. They’re quite common, with around 3 in 20 men and up to 2 in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives. The medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it’s known as renal colic. . It’s estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following 5 years. To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you don’t become dehydrated . It’s very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones. Read more about preventing kidney stones . Imaging tests Most kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home. But even small kidney stones can be painful, although this usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed. Medication If you are in severe pain, your GP can give you pain relief by injection. A second dose can be given after half an hour if you’re still experiencing pain. You should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. If your urine is yellow or brown, you’re not drinking enough. Admission to hospital This may be necessary if: you’re at an increased risk of your kidneys failing (for example, because you only have one kidney) This could include: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) ureteroscopy percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) open surgery Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) It involves using ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine. You may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones. ESWL is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter. Ureteroscopy If a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). It involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body) and into your bladder. It’s then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck. The surgeon may either try to gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine. Ureteroscopy is carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re unconscious), so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure. For stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50% to 80% of cases. A plastic tube called a stent may need to be temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) PCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. It may also be used if ESWL isn’t suitable – for example, because the person being treated is obese. PCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy. PCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic, so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure. PCNL is 86% effective for stones that are 21mm to 30mm (0.8in to 1.2in) in diameter. Open surgery Nowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare. Less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery. It’s only usually used if there’s a very large stone or abnormal anatomy. During open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. The kidney stone can then be removed. If you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around 3 litres (just over 5 pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it. Uric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they’re exposed to alkaline fluids. You may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve. sepsis ",

The kidneys and cancer The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage. Their main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only 1 of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer. The human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they’re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. Exactly what triggers this growth is unknown. However, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as smoking and obesity . Kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.

If you notice blood in your urine, your GP will usually carry out a blood test Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . If you need to be referred urgently, you’ll usually be seen within 2 weeks. Further tests If your GP refers you to a hospital specialist, further tests will help determine whether you have kidney cancer. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be caused by a cancerous tumour. An ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can’t be found. Computerised tomography scan You may also be referred for a computerised tomography (CT) scan . During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer. If you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer. Image-guided biopsy In some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided biopsy is carried out. It’s a minor surgical procedure performed under local anaesthetic . This means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but the area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don’t feel anything. During an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan You may also need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , which can be used to produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine its size. Cystoscopy A cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the inside of your bladder and urinary system. This procedure doesn’t look at the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream. X-rays are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys. Staging and grading If kidney cancer is confirmed, it’s usually possible to determine its grade and stage. The stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it’s likely to spread. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy can’t usually cure kidney cancer, but it can slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be used if a person isn’t fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small. Cryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision). Side effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter). Radiofrequency ablation ","Diagnosing kidney cancer . Types of kidney cancer Many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for more than 80% of all kidney cancers. Rarer types of kidney cancer include: transitional cell cancer – develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over Wilms’ tumour – a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children This topic focuses on RCC. Read the Cancer Research UK website for more information about transitional cell cancer and Wilms’ tumour . However, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer. If you’re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet. Read more about The exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition. The 3 main risk factors for kidney cancer are: obesity smoking family history and genetics Obesity Obesity is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer. There’s a strong link between someone’s body mass index (BMI) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. Read more about how BMI is calculated , and work out your BMI. A BMI score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person’s chances of developing kidney cancer. Those with a BMI score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk. This may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. It’s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells. Cases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels. Smoking Smoking is also a significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk. For example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you’re one-and-a-half times more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. This increases to twice as likely if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day. It’s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer. Family history and genetics If you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who’s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you’re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself. Examples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include: hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) – a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with HLRCC have a 10 to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer Other possible risk factors There are also a number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including: mild painkillers – some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer; NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen , may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful kidney disease – if you have kidney failure and need to have regular dialysis kidney stones .

Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action. Unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy radiotherapy or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney. Read more about . Preventing kidney cancer . kidney stone or bladder stone. high blood pressure (hypertension) – high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you’re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure Diagnosing kidney cancer Healthcare professionals use the TNM system to stage kidney cancer: T – indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue) N – indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection) M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread) The stages of tumour size are: T1a – where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches) in diameter T1b – where the tumour is 4 to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter T2 – where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches) in diameter, but hasn’t spread out of the kidney T3a – where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney T3b – where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body) T3c – where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part) T4 – where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney There are 3 lymph node stages: N0 – where no lymph nodes have been affected N1 – where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node N2 – where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodes M0 means that the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread. Kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer. Coping with cancer Being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it’s incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend. After cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with feelings of depression and anxiety . Antidepressants may also be used to help you through this process. Read more about nephrectomy embolisation radiotherapy targeted therapies immunotherapy You can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and chemotherapy ), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse. You’ll be given a key worker, usually the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care. the stage and grade of your cancer (how big it is and how far it’s spread) your age and general health If the cancer hasn’t spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney. Nephrectomy A nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney. If the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health. If the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed. It’s possible to live a normal life with only 1 kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate. During a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the kidney. There are 2 ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an: open nephrectomy – where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach) laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy – where a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages. A laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy. Some types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy. One of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it’s a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell. You should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team. Embolisation If you’re unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative operation known as embolisation. During embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use X-ray images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney. By blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink. Kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that’s less responsive to chemotherapy (where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells). However, a number of clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people. RFA can’t be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel. Targeted therapies sunitinib pazopanib axitinib sorafenib temsirolimus everolimus bevacizumab These medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they’re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread. At present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib have been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) . They’re available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that’s spread to other parts of their body. Sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren’t currently recommended by NICE. Sunitinib It’s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that’s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist. Common side effects of sunitinib include: nausea diarrhoea high blood pressure (hypertension) hair discolouration mouth soreness skin discolouration skin rashes or blisters The Cancer Research UK website has more information about sunitinib and its side effects . Pazopanib Like sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow. Pazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. It’s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you. Common side effects of pazopanib include: nausea diarrhoea high blood pressure hair discolouration abnormal liver function The Cancer Research UK website has more information about pazopanib . Axitinib Like sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing. Axitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after 2 weeks. It’s very important that you take the exact dose that’s been prescribed for you. Common side effects of axitinib include: diarrhoea nausea and vomiting loss of appetite tiredness a decrease in thyroid hormone level ( hypothyroidism ) headaches weight loss loss of fertility The Cancer Research UK website has more information about axitinib . Sorafenib Sorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow. Sorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective. Again, it’s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you. Common side effects of sorafenib include: diarrhoea fatigue nausea and vomiting hair thinning (in around one in four people) increased risk of bleeding – such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums loss of fertility flushed skin The Cancer Research UK website has more information about sorafenib. Temsirolimus Temsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It’s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that’s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow. Common side effects of temsirolimus include: red, dry, itchy skin nausea and vomiting lack of appetite diarrhoea a sore mouth or mouth ulcers sleeping problems loss of fertility Everolimus Everolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It’s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed. Common side effects of everolimus include: a sore mouth tiredness a rash or itchy, dry skin loss of appetite nausea and vomiting a lack of periods in women (this may be temporary) loss of fertility The Cancer Research UK website has more information about everolimus . Immunotherapy Another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that’s spread. It’s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections. Aldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection. The Cancer Research UK website has more information about . Preventing kidney cancer . Diet A low-fat, high-fibre diet that includes whole grains and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) is recommended for a healthy heart. You should also limit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure. Avoid eating foods high in saturated fat because it will increase your cholesterol level. High-fat foods include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter ghee – a type of clarified butter often used in Indian cooking lard cream hard cheese cakes and biscuits foods that contain coconut or palm oil There’s some evidence that eating a diet that has plenty of oily fish (at least 1 portion a week) may help reduce the risk of kidney cancer. Examples of oily fish include: salmon mackerel sardines trout herring Oily fish also contains vitamin D , which can reduce the risk of some cancers. You can also get vitamin D from sunlight or by taking supplements. Exercise It’s recommended that adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking , every week. The exercise should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate and you should feel slightly out of breath afterwards. Examples of activities you could incorporate into your exercise programme include: brisk walking hill climbing running cycling swimming If you find it difficult to do 150 minutes of exercise a week, start at a level you feel comfortable with. However, you should visit your GP for a health check if you’ve never exercised before or you’re returning to exercise after a long period of time. Read more about exercise and its benefits . Giving up smoking If you smoke, giving up is the most effective way of preventing kidney cancer, as well as a number of other serious health conditions, such as stroke , heart attack and lung cancer . Your GP can help if you want to stop smoking, by giving you information and advice, and prescribing medication. Our stopping smoking pages have useful information and advice about giving up smoking. Alternatively, you can call Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84. Read more about giving up smoking . Alcohol There’s evidence to suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, such as 4 to 5 glasses of wine a month, will help reduce your risk of developing kidney cancer. The reasons for this aren’t fully understood. However, you shouldn’t exceed the recommended limits for alcohol, because excessive drinking will place you at risk of developing liver disease , liver cancer , and high blood pressure (hypertension) .

Contact your GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection. If you have blood in your urine, you should always see your GP so the cause can be investigated. complications developing . Your GP can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection. See diagnosing kidney infections for more information They will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure. Urine test A urine test can help to establish whether you have a urinary tract infection (UTI) . The test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if there are any bacteria in it. You’ll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. If you do it at home, you’ll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. Ideally, hand it in to the surgery within four hours. A urine test can’t tell whether the infection – if you have one – is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder. Hospital scans You may be referred to hospital for further testing if: you’re at risk of complications of a kidney infection Children with recurrent UTIs will also be referred to hospital for further testing. In these circumstances, scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems. This may include: a computer tomography (CT) scan – where a scanner takes a series of X-rays and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed image of your urinary tract an ultrasound scan – which uses sound waves to build an image of the inside of your body an isotope scan – where a dye is injected into the bloodstream and a series of X-rays are taken Read more about urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney infection, including cystitis , should see their GP or out-of-hours emergency service. Medication Antibiotics If you’re being treated at home, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between 7 and 14 days. For most people – apart from pregnant women – antibiotics called ciprofloxacin or Co-amoxiclav are recommended. However, other antibiotics may also be used. Common side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick and diarrhoea . Co-amoxiclav can make the contraceptive pill and contraceptive patches Painkillers Taking a painkiller such as paracetamol However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen aren’t usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. This is because they may increase the risk of further kidney problems. Self-help tips If you have a kidney infection, try not to ‘hover’ over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in your bladder not being fully emptied. It’s also important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent dehydration and will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. Aim to drink enough so that you’re frequently passing pale-coloured urine. Make sure that you get plenty of rest. A kidney infection can be physically draining, even if you’re normally healthy and strong. It may take up to two weeks before you’re fit enough to return to work. blood poisoning , such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness you’re pregnant and you also have a high temperature you’re particularly frail and your general health is poor you have a weakened immune system you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a kidney stone or a urinary catheter you have diabetes you’re over the age of 65 you have an underlying condition that affects the way your kidneys work, such as polycystic kidney disease or chronic kidney disease If you’re admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you’ll probably be attached to a drip so you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. Antibiotics can also be given through the drip. You’ll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics are fighting off the infection. a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above chills abdominal pain loss of appetite pain when passing urine Kidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of your body, such as your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal. Smaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. Surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. This involves draining the pus out of the abscess using a needle that’s inserted into the kidney. Blood poisoning Blood poisoning (also called sepsis) is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection. It happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. Once bacteria are in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs. low blood pressure , which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up confusion or disorientation excessive sweating uncontrollable shaking or shivering high temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36C, or 96.8F) pale skin rapid heartbeat breathlessness Blood poisoning is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection. If you’re taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. This is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning. Severe infection Another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN). EPN is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys. The exact cause of EPN is unclear, but almost all cases are in people with diabetes. Read more about ","Diagnosing kidney infections A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys. Read more about the Who’s at risk? Kidney infections are relatively rare. It’s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK. They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are 6 times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman’s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys. Can kidney infections be prevented? A kidney infection happens when bacteria infects your kidneys. The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli, which live in your bowel. The bacteria get in through the opening of the urethra and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys. It’s thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex. In rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems. Who’s most likely to get a kidney infection? Women and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis . In women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to enter the urethra accidentally. The female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). This makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys. Other factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including: having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as kidney stones or an enlarged prostate – children with constipation can also be at an increased risk being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord – this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread having a weakened immune system – for example, due to type 2 diabetes or as a side effect of chemotherapy having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis – the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys having a urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine) being female and sexually active – sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder being a man who has anal sex – bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder being pregnant – this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys having undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) – an illegal practice where a woman’s genitals are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons Diagnosing kidney infections ",,"Complications of kidney infections Preventing kidney infections About kidney infections A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys. It’s more serious than cystitis , a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn’t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn’t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers. If you’re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection, for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip. After taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks. In rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning ( sepsis ) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess. Read more about and the complications of a kidney infection Read more about preventing a kidney infection antibiotics Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well. See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. A 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women. Your GP may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections. It’s standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. Only women who have had 2 or more kidney infections tend to be referred. Most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital. you’re severely dehydrated you’re unable to swallow or keep down any fluids or medications Complications of kidney infections Most kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems. Complications of a kidney infection are rare, but you’re more likely to develop them if you: are a child are over 65 are pregnant have diabetes , chronic kidney disease or sickle cell anaemia have had a kidney transplant (particularly in the first three months after the transplant) have a weakened immune system developed the kidney infection while in hospital Kidney abscess A kidney abscess is a rare, but serious, complication of a kidney infection, where pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney. You’re thought to be most at risk of developing a kidney abscess if you have diabetes . Kidney failure In very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. This is when the kidneys stop working properly. Kidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Other problems A kidney infection can also cause other complications, including high blood pressure (hypertension) or premature labour or birth. Preventing kidney infections The best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. These self-help tips explain how you can do this. Drink plenty of liquids Drinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract. Drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) . However, you should avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you’re taking warfarin , a medicine used to prevent blood clots. Cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there’s a risk of excessive bleeding. Toilet tips To help keep your urinary tract free from bacteria: go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in wipe from front to back after going to the toilet practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex empty your bladder after having sex if you’re a woman, avoid ‘hovering’ over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladder Treat constipation Constipation can increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI), so try to treat any constipation promptly. increasing the amount of fibre in your diet to 20g to 30g of fibre a day using a mild laxative on a short-term basis drinking plenty of fluids Be careful with contraceptives If you keep getting UTIs (more than 3 a year is considered high), avoid using spermicide-coated condoms or diaphragms . This is because spermicide can stimulate the production of bacteria. Stick to lubricated condoms without spermicide, because unlubricated ones can irritate the urethra and make it more vulnerable to infection. ",

In some patients chronic hepatitis B can cause liver damage ( cirrhosis ) and increase your risk of getting liver cancer . ",,,"Chronic hepatitis B means you’ve had the infection for more than 6 months. You may be offered medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage. Chronic hepatitis B often requires: regular checks for any further liver problems How is hepatitis B spread? The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood, semen and vaginal fluids and bodily fluids of an infected person. It can be spread by: a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters having sex with an infected person without using a condom sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils. How to prevent hepatitis B A vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is available for all babies born in the UK on or after 1 August 2017. It’s also available for people at high risk of the infection or complications from it. People at high risk of hepatitis B People at high risk of hepatitis B include: babies born to mothers with hepatitis B close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B people travelling to a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread families adopting or fostering children from high-risk countries people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs people who change their sexual partner often men who have sex with men male and female sex workers people whose job puts them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff people with chronic liver disease people with chronic kidney disease people in prison people receiving regular blood or blood products, and their carers Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) testing and lookback programme NHS Scotland is making the blood supply safer by introducing enhanced hepatitis B screening. This is an additional measure to improve testing for blood donors and further increase the safety of the blood supply chain. NHS Scotland has been conducting this enhanced screening on all donations since April 2022. Only a small number of donors are impacted, however, these donors will no longer be able to donate. Lookback programme NHS Scotland is also undertaking a lookback programme. Anyone who has received blood from a donor found to be positive for anti-HBc by this new test (anti-HBc) will be contacted by letter. If you’re affected, you’ll be offered testing, support and advice. Lookback programmes are happening across the UK. Further information about the programme is available Living with hepatitis B ",

Some ways the infection can be spread include: injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby having sex with an infected person without using a condom – if your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested if you had a blood transfusion in Scotland before September 1991, for example after a traffic accident or during childbirth, you may have been exposed to hepatitis C – all donor blood in Scotland has been screened for hepatitis C since September 1991 How to prevent hepatitis C There’s no vaccine for hepatitis C. There are things you can do to reduce your risk of becoming infected. Do use condoms when having anal sex, or sex with a new partner get vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B if you inject drugs, use a fresh safe injecting kit (available from needle exchanges) every time you inject Don’t do not share any drug-injecting equipment – including needles, syringes, spoons and filters do not share razors or toothbrushes The risk of getting hepatitis C through vaginal sex is very low. It may be higher if blood is present, such as period (menstrual) blood or from bleeding during anal sex.

Contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. Read more about a viral infection, such as a cold or flu a bacterial infection, which is much less common Read more about the This is actually known as vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis. The labyrinth also contains a small, spiral-shaped cavity called the cochlea. It sends sound waves to the language processing areas of the brain. Inflammation can disrupt this function, leading to hearing loss. Viral labyrinthitis Around half of all cases of viral labyrinthitis are thought to be caused when a viral infection of the chest, nose, mouth and airways – such as the common cold or flu – spreads to the inner ear. Infections that affect the rest of the body, such as measles , mumps or glandular fever , are a less common cause of viral labyrinthitis. Bacterial labyrinthitis Labyrinthitis can sometimes be caused by a bacterial infection. This is rarer than a viral infection and is likely to be more serious. Bacteria can enter the labyrinth if the thin layers of tissue that separate your middle ear from your inner ear are broken. This can happen if you have a middle ear infection or an infection of the brain lining ( meningitis ). Bacteria can also get into your inner ear if you have had a head injury. Immune system problems Labyrinthitis often develops in people who have an underlying autoimmune condition (where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue rather than fighting off infections). Diagnosing labyrinthitis Your GP may carry out the following tests: a physical examination – you may be asked to move your head or body and your ears will be checked for signs of inflammation and infection hearing tests – labyrinthitis is more likely if you have hearing loss Your GP will also check your eyes. If they are flickering uncontrollably, it is usually a sign that your vestibular system (the body’s balancing system) is not working properly. Viral or bacterial labyrinthitis? There is no reliable test to determine whether labyrinthitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection because testing for infection would damage the labyrinth. Doctors can usually safely assume that labyrinthitis is the result of a viral infection (more common) unless there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise, such as: the labyrinthitis is in a very young child labyrinthitis occurs in someone who is already known to have a bacterial infection Further testing severe headache mental confusion slurred speech weakness or paralysis on one side of your body These tests can include: a lumbar puncture – a fluid sample is taken from the base of your spine and checked for infection computerised tomography (CT) scan – to give a three-dimensional picture of your brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – to give a detailed image of your brain blood tests You can do several things to minimise any remaining feelings of dizziness and vertigo . For example: during an attack, lie still in a comfortable position (on your side is often best) avoid alcohol avoid bright lights Most people are able to tolerate prochlorperazine and side effects are uncommon, but can include: tremors (shaking) abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements sleepiness If you are vomiting, there is a prochlorperazine 3mg tablet available which you place inside your mouth between your gums and cheek. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids Antibiotics If your labyrinthitis is thought to be caused by a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed antibiotics . Depending on how serious the infection is, this could either be antibiotic tablets or capsules (oral antibiotics) or antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics). Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines for a full list of possible side effects. When to seek further advice mental confusion slurred speech double vision weakness or numbness in one part of your body a change in the way you usually walk Also contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. Chronic labyrinthitis A small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or even years. This is sometimes known as chronic labyrinthitis. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) ","Diagnosing labyrinthitis Who gets labyrinthitis? Most cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is relatively common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more widespread in children. Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under two years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis. Complications of labyrinthitis Bacterial labyrinthitis carries a higher risk of causing permanent hearing loss, particularly in children who have developed it as a complication of meningitis. Because of this high risk, a hearing test is recommended following bacterial labyrinthitis. Severe hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery. Read more information about hearing loss Vestibular neuronitis Labyrinthitis is caused by inflammation of part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. This is caused by an infection. How the labyrinth works You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery or working at heights if you’re feeling dizzy and unbalanced. Medication If your dizziness, vertigo and loss of balance are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe a short course of medication such as benzodiazepine or antiemetics (vestibular sedatives). Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepines reduce activity inside your central nervous system. This means your brain is less likely to be affected by the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system. However, long-term use of benzodiazepines is not recommended because they can be highly addictive if used for long periods. Antiemetics A prescription medication known as an antiemetic may be prescribed if you’re experiencing nausea and vomiting. ",,"Complications of labyrinthitis About labyrinthitis The labyrinth The labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains two important parts: the cochlea – this relays sounds to the brain and is responsible for hearing the vestibular system – a complex set of fluid-filled channels that contributes to your sense of balance Labyrinthitis is usually treated using a combination of self-help techniques and medication. Chronic labyrinthitis may be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). Self-help Drink plenty of liquid, little and often, particularly water, to avoid becoming dehydrated . VRT is usually carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist and involves a range of exercises designed to: co-ordinate your hand and eye movements stimulate sensations of dizziness so your brain starts to get used to disruptive signals sent by your vestibular system and then ignores them improve your balance and walking ability improve your strength and fitness The Brain and Spine Foundation is a UK charity that has more information about vestibular rehabilitation on its website. Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) . Complications of labyrinthitis Permanent hearing loss can be a common complication of labyrinthitis, particularly in children who have developed bacterial labyrinthitis as a complication of the brain infection meningitis. It’s estimated that as many as one in five children will develop hearing loss after having meningitis . The hearing loss can either be partial or complete. Because of the high risk of hearing loss occurring after bacterial labyrinthitis, it is recommended that a person is given a hearing test once they have recovered from the infection. Permanent, severe hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery. Read more information about hearing loss . ",

HIV,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/immune-system/hiv/,"HIV is a long-term health condition that is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. Speak to a sexual health service as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. ","Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection, which lasts for 2 weeks. This is known as primary HIV infection. fever (high temperature) sore throat body rash tiredness joint pain muscle pain swollen glands This means many people who have HIV do not know they’re infected. weight loss chronic diarrhoea night sweats skin problems recurrent infections serious life-threatening illnesses Testing for HIV If you think you might have HIV, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service contacting your GP practice for an appointment ordering a home test kit contacting clinics run by charities such as the Terrence Higgins Trust or Waverly Care Scotland for an appointment contacting local drug dependency services for an appointment Services available may vary depending on where you live. Some private clinics may offer HIV testing, but they may charge. Who should get tested for HIV? Anyone who thinks they may have HIV should get tested. Certain groups of people are at a higher risk and are advised to have regular tests. For example: gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men should have an HIV test at least once a year, or every 3 months if having sex without HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners women and men from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, should have an HIV test if having sex without using HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners people who inject drugs or have unprotected sex (sex without condoms or HIV PrEP ) with people who inject drugs What does a HIV test involve? The test for HIV is straightforward, highly accurate and is the only way to know if you’re infected. It involves taking a sample from the body for analysis. There are 4 main types of HIV test. Blood test Where a sample of blood is taken and sent to a lab for analysis. Results are usually available within a few days. Point of care test A sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken. This sample doesn’t need to be sent to a lab and the result is available within a few minutes. Anyone who has a reactive point of care test still needs a confirmed laboratory test. Home sampling kit Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for analysis. You’ll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies. Anyone who has a reactive home testing kit result is still required to have a laboratory confirmed test. Home testing kit Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The result is available within minutes. Check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK. ",,,"Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus multiplying in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage. These come in tablet form and must be taken every day. Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. How HIV is passed on You can get HIV by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex (sex without a condom or not taking HIV PrEP ). It may be possible for HIV to be passed on through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is very low. Other ways of getting HIV include: sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment from mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication from mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication blood transfusion (outside of the UK) Who is most at risk? People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include people who are not taking HIV PrEP medication and who are: men who have had unprotected anal sex with men women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high HIV prevalence country people who inject drugs people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection (STI) How to prevent HIV Safer sex The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex . This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. If you’re having anal sex it’s important to also use water-based or silicon-based lubricant. HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Taking HIV PrEP before you’re exposed to HIV means there’s a drug inside of you to block HIV if it gets into your body, so it can’t infect you. HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) If you think you may have recently been exposed to HIV and you haven’t taken HIV PrEP medication or used a condom, you should take PEP medication. PEP is a form of emergency HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV. PEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is. PEP is available from sexual health services or out of hours from A&E . If you inject drugs If you inject drugs, you should never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs). You can get free clean needles and other injecting equipment from your local injecting equipment providers, which are sometimes also called needle exchanges . Other STIs If you’ve been diagnosed with HIV you should get tested for all STIs and blood borne viruses including: chlamydia gonorrhoea syphilis hepatitis B hepatitis C Find your local sexual health clinic ",

Laryngitis is often linked to another illness, such as a cold , flu , throat infection ( pharyngitis ) or tonsillitis a headache swollen glands runny nose pain when swallowing feeling tired and achy When to seek medical help You should seek immediate medical help if you or your child experience breathing difficulties. Read more about the Read more about If you see your GP with laryngitis, they’ll discuss with you what could be causing the condition, including: overusing your voice smoking misusing alcohol allergies Your GP may refer you for blood tests and take a throat swab using a small cotton bud on a plastic shaft. This is to check for a possible viral, bacterial or fungal infection. They may also examine your larynx using a mirror to look for redness or swelling. Seeing a specialist If your GP thinks you need to see a specialist, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for some of the tests described below. Laryngoscopy A laryngoscopy is a test that involves examining your larynx using a thin tube containing a camera and light source (endoscope), which can be passed into your throat through either your nose or mouth. This test allows your doctor to assess any damage to your larynx. Laryngoscopies carried out through the nose are not painful, but it can be uncomfortable and the tube may trigger your gag reflex, which can make you feel like you want to be sick (it’s highly unlikely that you actually will be sick). Local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat, which should help reduce these feelings. If you’re having persistent problems with your voice, you might be asked to talk or sing while your larynx is examined. This may help your doctor determine why you’re having problems with your voice. For laryngoscopies carried out through the mouth, general anaesthetic is used. This means you’ll be asleep during the examination. You can often go home on the day you have this procedure, although an overnight stay in hospital is sometimes recommended. Testing for laryngeal cancer laryngeal cancer . Alcohol and tobacco are the two main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. The more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. ","Diagnosing laryngitis Read more about diagnosing laryngitis Why it happens In most cases, laryngitis is caused by either: a viral infection – such as a cold or flu , or damage to your larynx – usually by straining your voice alcohol misuse or an allergic reaction How laryngitis is treated Laryngitis occurs when the larynx (voice box) becomes irritated and swollen. It’s usually caused by an infection or damage to the larynx. Infection Viral infections such as a cold or flu are the most common type of infection associated with acute laryngitis. Rarer types of infection include: bacterial infections – such as diphtheria fungal infections – such as thrush (candidiasis) or aspergillosis People with weakened immune systems, caused by conditions such as HIV or as a result of chemotherapy or steroid medication , are thought to be most at risk from fungal laryngitis. Laryngitis caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection is known as infectious laryngitis. Damage to the larynx Laryngitis is also often caused by straining your voice, such as speaking or singing for long periods or shouting and singing loudly. Straining your voice can cause your vocal cords to vibrate at a faster rate than they should. This excessive vibration can damage the surface of your vocal cords, causing them to become inflamed. Laryngitis caused by damage to the larynx is known as mechanical laryngitis. direct trauma to the larynx – such as a blow to your throat, an accident or a sports injury prolonged coughing persistent and frequent clearing of your throat As well as infection and damage to the larynx, laryngitis can also be caused by: smoking and alcohol misuse , which can dry out and irritate your larynx gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – when stomach acid leaks out of your stomach and up into your throat, where it can irritate your larynx allergic reactions to substances such as dust, fumes, chemicals and toxins Diagnosing laryngitis In some cases, it’s possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. For example: bacterial infections (but not viral infections) can be treated with antibiotics if smoking or alcohol misuse is causing laryngitis, stopping smoking or cutting down how much you drink can help gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can be treated with medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces – see ",,"About laryngitis Can laryngitis be prevented? As laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it’s not always possible to prevent it. However, you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by: making sure you have the annual flu vaccine (if recommended by your GP) practising good personal hygiene  – such as washing your hands before and after eating and after using the toilet avoiding close contact with people who have respiratory infections, such as a cold or flu – particularly if you’re prone to laryngitis avoiding irritants, such as smoke or dust – particularly if you have a cold or other respiratory tract infection not smoking not drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol consumption not regularly clearing your throat – as this can irritate the larynx (try swallowing instead) raising your head with pillows when you’re sleeping – to protect your larynx from any acid reflux from your stomach during sleep not shouting or singing loudly or for long periods of time – it’s important for people who regularly use their voice excessively to receive proper training so they don’t damage their larynx Tests your ENT specialist may recommend to check for laryngeal cancer include: computerised tomography (CT) scan – a series of X-rays are taken and assembled by a computer into a more detailed 3D image of your throat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed scans of the inside of your throat biopsy – where a sample of tissue is taken during a laryngoscopy to check for the presence of cancerous cells Other tests Other tests that may also be carried out include: a skin allergy test to check whether you have an allergy to certain substances chest and neck X-ray to check for any abnormalities, such as an unusual narrowing or swelling of your larynx You may be able to help your recovery by: not smoking and avoiding smoky, dry or dusty environments drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – particularly water (avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks), even though swallowing may be painful taking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – which may ease any associated pain, headaches and fever (children under the age of 16 shouldn’t take aspirin) gargling with a mouthwash of warm, salty water or an over-the-counter solution, or sucking lozenges – this may help to soothe a sore throat using menthol inhalation and air humidifiers – which may soothe your airways and help keep them clear avoiding speaking when possible and only speaking softly when you need to – but don’t whisper because this can put more strain on your larynx for more information if an allergy is causing laryngitis, you may be able to avoid the substance you’re allergic to or take antihistamines to control your body’s response to the substance – see for more information if straining your voice is causing laryngitis, you may benefit from vocal therapy (see below) ",

Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. Read more about the If you’re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). Depending on what dairy products you’re able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin D supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. These are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose. Read more about flatulence and bloating. Types of lactase deficiency The main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below. Primary lactase deficiency Primary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. This type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families. Secondary lactase deficiency Secondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. It can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication. Secondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the UK, particularly in babies and young children. Further testing Other tests aren’t usually needed, but your GP may sometimes suggest further tests to: coeliac disease . In a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that’s passed down your throat. This will be carried out under local anaesthetic , so it won’t hurt. The sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. If it only contains a small amount of lactase, it’s likely you’re lactose intolerant. The sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease. Some cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by gastroenteritis , are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. Other cases, such as those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong. Changing your diet If you decide to experiment with what you can and can’t eat, make sure to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. This will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems. Eating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain vitamins and minerals in your diet and increase your risk of complications. You’ll also need to make sure you’re getting enough nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements. If you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your GP about your diet. Milk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks. You may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child’s, diet. Sources of lactose Some of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you’re lactose intolerant are described below. Milk A major source of lactose is milk, including cow’s milk, goat’s milk and sheep’s milk. Depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet. For example: you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities you may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbed Dairy products Other dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant. Some dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them. It’s worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they’re a good source of essential nutrients such as calcium. Other foods and drinks As well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose. These include: salad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise biscuits chocolate boiled sweets cakes some types of bread and other baked goods some breakfast cereals packets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits packets of instant potatoes and instant soup some processed meats, such as sliced ham Check the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients. The lactose found in some foods won’t necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk products such as cheese, butter and cream. Some ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don’t, such as lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. These ingredients don’t need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant. Medication If you need to start taking a new medication, check with your GP or pharmacist in case it contains lactose. Lactose-free foods and drinks There are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid. Food and drinks that don’t usually contain lactose include: soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato foods which carry the ‘dairy-free’ or ‘suitable for vegans’ signs carob bars Getting enough calcium If you’re unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet. Calcium has several important functions, including: helping build strong bones and teeth regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat) ensuring blood clots normally Therefore, it’s a good idea to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as: green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra soya beans tofu nuts bread and anything made with fortified flour fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards) You can also buy combined calcium and vitamin D supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health. It’s important to check with your GP or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects. Lactase substitutes In addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain lactase substitutes. These are available from most health foods shops. Lactase substitutes can either be added to milk or taken just before eating a meal containing lactose. Lactose intolerance in children If your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it’s important for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development. In general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above). For babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, soya formula isn’t recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby’s future physical and sexual development. Breastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk. For many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. After this point it’s safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. They contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as vitamins A, B12 and D. Lactose is also important because it helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, including magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you are lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions. Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. Malnutrition – when the food you eat does not give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you are malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. If you are concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian. ","Diagnosing lactose intolerance The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. Who’s affected? In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent. Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected. Is it an allergy? Lactose intolerance isn’t the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies Lactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase. If you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn’t produce enough lactase. Digesting lactose After eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it’s digested. The digested food then passes into your small intestine. The lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. If there isn’t enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine). gastroenteritis – an infection of the stomach and intestines coeliac disease – a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten Crohn’s disease ulcerative colitis – a long-term condition that affects the large intestine chemotherapy ","find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance Some of the main tests that may be used are described below. Hydrogen breath test A hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant. You’ll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. When you arrive for the test, you’ll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag. This sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm). You’ll then be given a drink of lactose solution and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes. If your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it’s likely that you’re lactose intolerant. This is because lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal. Lactose tolerance test In a lactose tolerance test, you’ll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains. If you’re lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose. Milk tolerance test In a milk tolerance test, you’ll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels don’t rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant. Small bowel biopsy ","Complications of lactose intolerance About lactose intolerance Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products. Complications of lactose intolerance Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. If you’re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. Malnutrition – when the food you eat doesn’t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you’re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. If you’re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian. long courses of antibiotics The decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it’s caused by a long-term condition. It’s also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. This is because your body’s production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older. Congenital lactase deficiency Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies. It’s caused by an inherited genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase. The genetic mutation responsible for congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on the condition. Developmental lactase deficiency Some babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn’t fully developed by the time they were born. This is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as affected babies get older. Diagnosing lactose intolerance ",
Liver tumours,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/liver-tumours/,Liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Boys are affected more commonly than girls. There are 2 main types of primary liver cancer. Hepatoblastoma This usually occurs in children under 5 years old. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) This is rarer and usually occurs in older children. ,"How liver tumours are diagnosed A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour. An ultrasound scan and X-rays will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including CT (computerised tomography) scans or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans , will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver. Blood tests will also be carried out. ","The cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children. Children who are infected with hepatitis B have a higher risk of developing HCC in late childhood than uninfected children. feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss an increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoea Late side effects The chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. These may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. There will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. Most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. Your child’s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects. Recurrence ","This grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world. This grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. Grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. Grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not. PRETEXT 1 – 1 liver sector is affected and the tumour can be removed by straightforward surgery PRETEXT 2 – 2 adjoining sectors are affected and the tumour can be removed with more extensive surgery PRETEXT 3 – 2 or 3 sectors are affected with no 2 adjoining sectors free of disease, and the tumour can be removed with major surgery PRETEXT 4 – all 4 sectors of the liver are affected, and the tumour cannot be removed without replacing the liver with a donor liver transplant Doctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver. In the blood vessels Sometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. This may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour. In the abdomen Sometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). The tumour cannot be removed completely. In the lungs or other organs If the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. About 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. Doctors use X-rays and CT or MRI scans to assess whether the lungs are affected. biopsy Hepatoblastoma ","It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. The liver The liver is the largest organ in the body. It’s surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. It’s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs. The liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. One of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. Some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. The liver also destroys harmful substances. It breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions). The liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. It stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed. The liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine). The liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. This duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine. The liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. It can function normally even if only a small part of it is working. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. Grouping PRETEXT 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called ‘standard risk’. PRETEXT 4 is called ‘high risk’ and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body. Hepatocellular carcinoma Chemoembolisation This refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. Very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer. Targeted drugs Surgery All children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. If there’s cancer in the lungs, which hasn’t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. If the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later. If the tumour involves all 4 sectors of the liver (PRETEXT 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. This is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. In a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person. This will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. The transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. A liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Lung cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/lung-cancer/,About lung cancer ,"a persistent cough coughing up blood persistent breathlessness unexplained tiredness and weight loss an ache or pain when breathing or coughing Read more about the Types of lung cancer Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer. There are 2 main types of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are: non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma small-cell lung cancer – a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer a cough that doesn’t go away after 2 or 3 weeks a long-standing cough that gets worse persistent chest infections coughing up blood an ache or pain when breathing or coughing persistent breathlessness persistent tiredness or lack of energy loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing) a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing wheezing a hoarse voice swelling of your face or neck persistent chest or shoulder pain If you have any of these, you should speak to your GP. Read further information: , such as breathlessness or a persistent cough. You may be asked to have a blood test chest infection . In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer. Chest X-ray A chest X-ray is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass. Surgery isn’t usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it’s diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning. Surgery There are 3  types of lung cancer surgery: lobectomy – where one or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed – your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed – this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung – this is usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer) Tests before surgery Before surgery can take place, you’ll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include: an electrocardiogram (ECG) – electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart spirometry – you’ll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out How it’s performed Surgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision) in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it’s thought that the cancer may have spread to them. In some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest on a monitor. After the operation You’ll probably be able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation. After your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications. Side effects Side effects of radiotherapy to the chest include: chest pain fatigue persistent cough that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about) difficulties swallowing (dysphagia) redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn hair loss on your chest Side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be: given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery (this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial) given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning combined with radiotherapy breathing problems a cough coughing up blood Cryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour. Photodynamic therapy Living with lung cancer Pain Some people with lung cancer have pain, while others never have any. About 1 in 3 people who are treated for cancer experience some pain. As your cancer progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your (and your carer’s) wishes. This includes whether you’d prefer to go to hospital, a hospice, or be looked after at home as you become progressively more ill. It will take account of what services are available to you locally, what’s clinically advisable and your personal circumstances. More about palliative care Read further information: NICE: Supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer Macmillan Cancer Support: Looking after someone with cancer Marie Curie Cancer Care: Support for patients Preventing lung cancer If you smoke, the best way to prevent lung cancer and other serious conditions is to stop smoking as soon as possible. However long you have been smoking, it’s always worth quitting. Every year you don’t smoke decreases your risk of getting serious illnesses, such as lung cancer. After 10 years of not smoking, your chances of developing lung cancer falls to half that of someone who smokes. Quit Your Way Scotland can offer advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking. Your GP or pharmacist can also give you help and advice about giving up smoking. Diet Research suggests that eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including at least 5 portions a day of fresh fruit and vegetables and plenty of whole grains, can reduce your risk of lung cancer, as well as other types of cancer and heart disease. More about eating well Exercise There’s strong evidence to suggest that regular exercise can lower the risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer. Adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. More about keeping active ","Diagnosing lung cancer preventing lung cancer Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition. Smoking Smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. It’s responsible for more than 85% of all cases. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can lead to the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing). If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker. While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer . These products include: cigars pipe tobacco snuff (a powdered form of tobacco) chewing tobacco Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco. While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer. It’s been estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes. Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer. Passive smoking If you don’t smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer. For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner. Radon Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings. If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you’re a smoker. Occupational exposure and pollution Exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include: arsenic asbestos beryllium cadmium coal and coke fumes silica nickel Read more information about asbestosis and silicosis. Research also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles). Read further information about the Diagnosing lung cancer Speak to your GP if you have ","If your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven’t already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do, what type it is and how much it’s spread. CT scan A computerised tomography (CT) scan is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body. Before having a CT scan, you’ll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete. PET-CT scan A PET-CT scan (which stands for positron emission tomography-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage. Before having a PET-CT scan, you’ll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You’ll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30 to 60 minutes. Bronchoscopy and biopsy If the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you’ll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor or nurse to remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs. During a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells ( biopsy ). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs. The procedure may be uncomfortable, but you’ll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a local anaesthetic to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes. Other types of biopsy If you’re not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you’ve had one and the results weren’t clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin. Percutaneous needle biopsy A percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells. The doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing. Thoracoscopy A thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples. You’re likely to need a general anaesthetic before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests. After a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out. Mediastinoscopy A mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum). For this test, you’ll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest. The tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They’ll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they’re usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to. Staging ","Living with lung cancer Preventing lung cancer About lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer. Read more about diagnosing lung cancer Who’s affected Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It’s rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74. Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances. Read more about: If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended. If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health, radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead. If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually used. Read more about Non-small-cell lung cancer Stage 1 The cancer is contained within the lung and hasn’t spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages: stage 1A – the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches) stage 1B – the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches) Stage 2 Stage 2 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 2A and 2B. In stage 2A lung cancer, either: the tumour is 5 to 7cm the tumour is less than 5cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes In stage 2B lung cancer, either: the tumour is larger than 7cm the tumour is 5 to 7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes the cancer hasn’t spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding muscles or tissue the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus) the cancer has caused the lung to collapse there are multiple small tumours in the lung Stage 3 Stage 3 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 3A and 3B. In stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be: the covering of the lung (the pleura) the chest wall the middle of the chest other lymph nodes near the affected lung In stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following: lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel Stage 4 In stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs. Small-cell lung cancer Small-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer only has 2 possible stages: limited disease – the cancer has not spread beyond the lung extensive disease – the cancer has spread beyond the lung Cancer Research UK has further information on types of lung cancer . the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer) the size and position of the cancer how far advanced your cancer is (the stage) your overall health radiotherapy and chemotherapy Non-small-cell lung cancer If you have non-small-cell lung cancer that’s confined to one lung and you’re in good general health, you’ll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body. If the cancer hasn’t spread too far but surgery isn’t possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy). Small-cell lung cancer Complications As with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in 1 out in 5 cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer. Complications of lung surgery can include: inflammation or infection of the lung ( pneumonia ) excessive bleeding a blood clot in the leg ( deep vein thrombosis ), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism) Radiotherapy An intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn’t healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery. The 3 main ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below: conventional external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body stereotactic radiotherapy – a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible internal radiotherapy – a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung – a small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes For lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it’s thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it’s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances. Radical radiotherapy is usually given 5 days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10 to 15 minutes and the course usually lasts 4 to 7 weeks. Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given 3 times a day for 12 days in a row. Chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead. Side effects Side effects of chemotherapy can include: fatigue nausea vomiting mouth ulcers hair loss Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell. Biological therapies Examples of biological therapies include erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation computerised tomography (CT) scanner to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells. The most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air. Cryotherapy Photodynamic therapy is carried out in 2 stages. Firstly, you’ll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light. The next stage is carried out 24 to 72 hours later. A thin tube will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam. In many cases, breathlessness can be improved with some simple measures such as: making daily activities easier – for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don’t need to regularly walk up and down the stairs using a fan to direct cool air towards your face eating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfuls Read further information: Macmillan Cancer Support: Managing breathlessness Cancer Research UK: Coping with breathlessness Read further information: Macmillan Cancer Support: Controlling cancer pain Macmillan Cancer Support: Pain Emotional effects and relationships Having cancer can lead to a range of emotions. These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression. People deal with serious problems in different ways. It’s hard to predict how living with cancer will affect you. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help you may put others at ease. But don’t feel shy about telling people that you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you need. Read further information: Macmillan: Cancer and your emotions Talk to others Your GP or specialist nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist phone helpline. Your GP practice will have information on these. If you have feelings of depression , talk to your GP – they can provide advice and support. Read further information: The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: Lung cancer support groups Macmillan Cancer Support: Depression Money and financial support If you have to reduce or stop work because of cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. If you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer. If you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance .

Lichen planus,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/lichen-planus/,About lichen planus ,"Lichen planus is an itchy rash that can occur anywhere on the body. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Who’s affected by lichen planus Lichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population. It’s more common in adults over the age of 40. Lichen planus of the skin affects men and women equally. However, oral lichen planus is more common in women. The mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus). steroid creams or ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash. Most cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6 to 9 months. The rash rarely lasts longer than 18 months. However, oral lichen planus and lichen planus that affects the genital area may be more persistent. Read more about how lichen planus is treated . Erosive lichen planus Areas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the: skin mouth penis vulva (external female sex organs) and vagina Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Lichen planus of the skin purple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham’s striae) thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles – this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus itchy skin Lichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected. Thickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits. After the papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured. Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks red and white patches in the mouth burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking painful red gums Mild cases of oral lichen planus don’t usually cause any pain or discomfort. Lichen planus of the penis purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans) bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny a non-itchy rash Lichen planus of the vulva and vagina soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina a sticky yellow or green discharge, which may be bloodstained the opening of the vagina can become narrowed Other areas Lichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including: the nails – which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing the scalp – red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent hair loss can occur . Reaction to medication A reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. For example: gold injections – these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people with arthritis to help reduce inflammation and painful joints antimalarial tablets – these help treat and prevent malaria (a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes) Diagnosing lichen planus Lichen planus is often diagnosed by a GP or dentist examining the affected area. Lichen planus of the skin Self-help Lichen planus of the skin avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water instead wash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo use an emollient to moisturise your skin Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) avoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus avoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread avoid drinking alcohol, particularly spirits if areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge if possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste avoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible visit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy Lichen planus of the genitals avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream use an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating applying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin – wrap it in a clean tea towel before placing it on your body) women should avoid wearing tights Lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include: increased appetite weight gain insomnia fluid retention (inability to pass urine) mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious allergies , such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that’s causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this. ","Diagnosing lichen planus In some cases, long-term erosive lichen planus can increase the chance of some types of cancer developing. Read our page on complications of lichen planus for more information about erosive lichen planus. The cause of lichen planus is unknown. It’s thought to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines. Lichen planus isn’t infectious, doesn’t usually run in families and can’t be passed on to others. Autoimmune reaction The immune system protects your body against illness and infection by producing antibodies (proteins) that attack bacteria and viruses. excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) lightening of the skin Always check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Corticosteroid tablets Corticosteroid tablets Occasionally, in around 2% of cases, long-term cases of erosive lichen planus can develop into certain types of cancer , such as: mouth cancer vulval cancer penile cancer Regularly examining yourself and being aware of any changes that occur will help you to identify any problems at an early stage. Pay close attention to ulcerated areas in your mouth or genitals that don’t heal and persist for a long time. Visit your GP immediately if you notice any changes that you’re concerned about. You should also visit your dentist regularly to ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, and that any ulcers or patches that form in your mouth are examined and treated promptly. Depending on individual circumstances, dental check-ups for adults are recommended anywhere between every 3 to 24 months.

If a skin biopsy is required, you’ll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the affected area so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) A dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth. ","Complications of lichen planus About lichen planus Lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body. Affected areas can include the: arms, legs and trunk mouth (oral lichen planus) nails and scalp vulva, vagina and penis The exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. However, the condition isn’t infectious and doesn’t usually run in families. It can’t be passed on to other people, including sexual partners. Corticosteroid creams and ointments Corticosteroid creams and ointments contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often referred to as topical corticosteroids . Topical corticosteroids help treat the swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have. nature of the condition being treated Potential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include: redness or burning and stinging of the skin skin rash thinning of the skin (atrophy) stretch marks (striae) Acitretin – this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice. Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth In more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis. It can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it’s recommended that you: stop smoking (if you smoke) avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol have a healthy, balanced diet , including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables You should also maintain good oral hygiene by cleaning your teeth at least twice a day, and having regular dental check-ups , so that any problems with your teeth or mouth can be identified and treated early. immunomodulating agents (used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) – these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus You’ll also need to have regular blood tests Further information and support You can find support and information from organisations like: Changing Faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice Complications of lichen planus Complications of lichen planus may include discoloured skin and, in some cases, erosive lichen planus may develop into certain types of cancer. Skin pigmentation After the lichen planus rash has cleared up, the affected area of skin may be a different colour to what it was originally. There may be a brown or grey mark, which can sometimes last for months. This is known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and tends to be more noticeable in people with darker skin.

Leg cramps,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/leg-cramps/,Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition. They cause the muscles in your leg to suddenly become tight and painful. ,"A leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. It’s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle. Cramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. This includes your feet and thighs. Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest. During a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff. After the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours. Cramps often happen during the night when you’re sleeping. When to get help Leg cramps might be a sign of a more serious health condition. Speak to your GP urgently if: leg cramps last longer than 10 minutes and don’t get better when you start to move leg cramps develop after you’ve come into contact with a substance like mercury, lead or dirt that gets in a cut If your GP is closed, phone 111. Speak to your GP if: your leg cramps are affecting your quality of life you’re having frequent leg cramps your leg cramps are interfering with your sleep you also have numbness or swelling in your legs your leg muscles are shrinking or becoming weaker In this case, you may need further tests, like blood tests and urine tests, to rule out other conditions. Leg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born. ","The cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, there may be an underlying condition or identifiable cause (secondary leg cramps). Idiopathic leg cramps Idiopathic leg cramps may be caused by: abnormal nerve activity during sleep excessive strain placed on leg muscles, for example during exercise a sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected muscles Also, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older. This may explain why older people are particularly affected by leg cramps. Tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. If your tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp. Secondary leg cramps Secondary leg cramps are caused by an underlying condition or another identifiable cause like: pregnancy – the extra weight of pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping exercise – leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise neurological conditions – for example, motor neurone disease or peripheral neuropathy liver disease – if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles spasm infection – some types of bacterial infection, like tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm toxins – in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, like lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps dehydration – in some people, low levels of water in the body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle cramps ",,"Medication is usually only needed in persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise. Medication Certain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. If you develop leg cramps after starting a new medication, speak to your pharmacist. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless your GP or healthcare professional advises you to do so. Stretches for leg cramps Most cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes. To stretch your calf muscles: Stand with the front half of your feet on a step, with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly lower your heels so that they are below the level of the step. Hold for a few seconds before lifting your heels back up to the starting position. Repeat a number of times. Preventing leg cramps If you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency. You might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night. If you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards. Placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position. If you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed. This will keep your feet in a relaxed position. It’ll help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing. Keep your sheets and blankets loose. ",
Lymphoedema,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/lymphoedema/,About lymphoedema ,"Lymphoedema can get worse if it’s not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition. Read more about the and diagnosing lymphoedema These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. Read more about The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight. an aching, heavy feeling difficulty with movement repeated skin infections the skin becoming hard and tight folds developing in the skin wart-like growths developing on the skin a leakage of fluid through the skin In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg. breast cancer , lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years. Read more about the examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it’s enlarged Further tests Although not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. These tests are explained below. Measuring limb volume In some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. These may include: a tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume water displacement – where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb perometry – infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volume Bioimpedance testing During a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. The electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. Changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue. Imaging tests Imaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. These include: a lymphoscintigraph – you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body an ultrasound scan – which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body a computerised tomography (CT) scan – which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodes These scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue. Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) There are four components to DLT: compression bandages and garments – to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up skin care – to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection exercises – to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage specialised massage techniques – known as manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling Each of these components is described in more detail below. redness and a feeling of heat in the skin pain in the affected area a high temperature (fever) chills Cellulitis can usually be successfully treated with antibiotics , although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital. Psychological impact Living with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression . Read more about Healthy lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the condition if you already have it. This includes: eating a healthy diet maintaining a healthy weight exercising regularly ","Diagnosing lymphoedema Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues. Abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema. There are two main types of lymphoedema: primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer Who is affected A recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema. Secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after breast cancer When to seek medical advice Primary lymphoedema Primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body). These “faulty” genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should. Primary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves. Secondary lymphoedema Secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system. eczema Venous diseases Venous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid. Some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body varicose veins Obesity People who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. It’s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them. ",,"Complications of lymphoedema Preventing lymphoedema About lymphoedema Read more about the Primary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people. How lymphoedema is treated and preventing lymphoedema Complications The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection. In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition. Read more about the complications of lymphoedema cancer Read more about diagnosing lymphoedema Cancer Although the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn’t always possible. breast cancer melanoma skin cancer gynaecological cancers – such as cervical cancer and vulval cancer genitourinary cancers – such as prostate cancer or penile cancer Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue. If it’s necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly. Infections In some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema. Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred. Another infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. This is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the UK. Inflammation Conditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include: rheumatoid arthritis Trauma and injury In a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. For example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising. Immobility Movement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. Therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling. For example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema. Diagnosing lymphoedema Compression bandages and garments Unlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. Instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid. If you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. These will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb. These may also be applied after a session of MLD, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. This use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging. Velcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves. You will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period. Skin care Taking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such as cellulitis . Read our page on preventing lymphoedema for more skin care advice. Movement and exercises Your lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. They will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. This will be tailored to your requirements and ability. Your plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking. Massage To begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – usually carried out by a specialist therapist – to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained. Surgery In a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. There are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition: the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking) the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) – see below the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system – for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis) Liposuction Liposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. It can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size. Once the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. However, NICE says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety. Access to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). Complications of lymphoedema Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition. These complications are explained below. Cellulitis Many people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes of cellulitis (also known as erysipelas). Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. Cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition. Talking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. The Lymphoedema Support Network offers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area. Preventing lymphoedema It’s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition. If you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse. Skin care The part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. Any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection. Skin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop. You can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by: not having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible using insect repellents to prevent insect bites moisturising the skin daily to keep it supple – your GP can prescribe a suitable cream avoiding very hot baths and showers – the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling using sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) to prevent sunburn wearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected using anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected cutting your nails with nail clippers seeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care – but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema wearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected using an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself not wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellery ",
Liver cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/liver-cancer/,About liver cancer ,"unexplained weight loss loss of appetite feeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small feeling sick and vomiting pain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy) jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes) itchy skin feeling very tired and weak You should also contact your GP if you have previously been diagnosed with a condition known to affect the liver, such as cirrhosis or a hepatitis C infection, and your health suddenly deteriorates. Read more about However, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation can scar the liver. The exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes . Hepatitis C A long-term infection of hepatitis C can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver. Hepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most common ways this happens worldwide include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared. If you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases. If they feel you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist. Surveillance for liver cancer If you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening – known as surveillance – is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it. Surveillance is usually carried out every 6 months and often involves: ultrasound scans – high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities blood tests – your blood is tested for a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is found in some people with liver cancer Surveillance is usually recommended if you have cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver cancer. The potential benefits of surveillance should be discussed with you before you enter any screening programme. Further testing The tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened. Surgical resection If damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection. As the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver’s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe. Whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). If a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a general anaesthetic , which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain as it is carried out. Most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover. Risks Liver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery. Possible complications of liver resection include: infection at the site of the surgery bleeding after the surgery blood clots that develop in your legs – the medical term for this is deep vein thrombosis (DVT) bile leaking from the liver – further surgery may be required to stop the leak jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly) Liver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack. Liver transplant A liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy liver from a donor. This is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications. A liver transplant may be suitable for you if you: only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter have 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm) The risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer. TACE procedure During TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery). Chemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow. TACE usually takes one to 2 hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home. This procedure can be completed several times if necessary. Side effects Injecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness. However, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick. Read more about chemotherapy . Alcohol injections Some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative. Read more about end of life care . ","Diagnosing liver cancer The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but most cases are associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis. hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection. It is also believed obesity and an unhealthy diet can increase the risk of liver cancer because this can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . By avoiding or cutting down on alcohol, eating healthily and exercising regularly , and taking steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B and C, you may be able to significantly reduce your chances of developing liver cancer. Read more about the . Who is affected? Despite being a common type of cancer worldwide, liver cancer is relatively uncommon in the UK. However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition. The number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around 2 in every 3 cases affect men. Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity. The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called cirrhosis . This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions. Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour. In cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person’s chances of developing the condition. However, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can also develop liver cancer. Heavy and harmful drinking The liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver’s resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it. Every time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids. Like hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs. It affects about 1 in every 200 people in the UK. Most of those infected were born in parts of the world where the hepatitis B virus is very common. As with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time. If you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases. Diagnosing liver cancer For many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition. Similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result. There are 3 main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out: where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously) where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen – ‘keyhole’ surgery (laparoscopy) where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen – ‘open’ surgery Continuous ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) scans are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position. Microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic (where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated. ","Liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver. However, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis. The further tests include: computerised tomography (CT) scans – a series of X-rays of your liver are taken to give a more detailed three-dimensional image magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans – uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver biopsy – a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy) to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells laparoscopy – a small incision is made in your abdomen under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver Staging liver cancer Staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer. Many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person’s condition. ","About liver cancer Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver. This is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver. The rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about secondary liver cancer . Read more about diagnosing liver cancer . How liver cancer is treated surgical resection – surgery to remove a section of liver liver transplant – where the liver is replaced with a donor’s liver microwave or radiofrequency ablation – where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells chemotherapy . Haemochromatosis Haemochromatosis is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food. Primary biliary cirrhosis Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare and poorly understood liver condition. One of the main functions of the liver is to create a fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts. One combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of 5 stages. These are: stage 0 – the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function stage A – a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function stage B – there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected stage C – any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body stage your liver cancer is at. If your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The 3 main ways this can be achieved are: removing the affected section of liver – known as a resection having a liver transplant – an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one using heat to kill cancerous cells – known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) If you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit. If you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults. In some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant. The advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long. Read more about liver transplants . Microwave or radiofrequency ablation Microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter. You may experience some minor discomfort and flu TACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant. In most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won’t feel any pain. Sorafenib Sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth. Whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether you will significantly benefit from the medication.

Lupus,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/immune-system/lupus/,About lupus ,"Types of lupus There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects. However, the term “lupus” is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life. The rest of this article will focus on SLE. fatigue (extreme tiredness) rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands joint pain and swelling Read more about the and diagnosing lupus . These medications include: hydroxychloroquine – a medicine that has historically been used to treat malaria corticosteroids – anti-inflammatory medications immunosuppressants – a group of medicines that suppress your immune system With good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively. Read more about Fatigue Many people with SLE find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of SLE because it has a negative impact on their work and social life. Joint pain If you have SLE, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. You may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning. Unlike some other conditions that affect the joints, SLE is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed. Rashes Many people with SLE develop rashes on their skin – most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a “butterfly rash” or “malar rash”. Rashes caused by SLE may get better after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent. Rashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as “photosensitivity”. Other features of SLE may include: a fever (high temperature) swollen lymph glands (small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin) recurring mouth ulcers hair loss (alopecia) high blood pressure (hypertension) headaches and migraines stomach (abdominal) pain chest pain depression dry eyes memory loss seizures (fits) problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination ( psychosis ) shortness of breath Raynaud’s phenomenon a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet when it is cold ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema) When to seek medical advice Read more about diagnosing lupus . smoking Diagnosing lupus and a number of blood tests may need to be carried out. Blood tests Some of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test A blood test called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to determine whether there is any inflammation in your body. This can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including the joints and internal organs. The test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation. Anti-nuclear antibody test An anti-nuclear antibody test checks whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody. Complement level test Complement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system. The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active. Other tests Once you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular monitoring to see how the condition is affecting your body. If you have SLE it is possible you may develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible. You may need to have scans, such as an X-ray , ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs. Read more about the complications of lupus . This means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions. As people get most of their vitamin D as a result of direct sunlight on the skin, there is a risk you may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure. This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as osteoporosis (weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Commonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include ibuprofen , naproxen and diclofenac. You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP. NSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise about which NSAID is right for you. Side effects If taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding. If you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach. Hydroxychloroquine Hydroxychloroquine is a medicine that has been used to treat malaria You will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Side effects Side effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include indigestion , diarrhoea , headaches and rashes. Hydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine. If your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids Side effects When prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include: thinning of your bones thinning of your skin weight gain high blood pressure (hypertension) Commonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Side effects Immunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as: loss of appetite vomiting diarrhoea swollen gums bruising or bleeding more easily headache acne extra hair growth weight gain liver damage an increased risk of infection (see below) Methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used. Tell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted. Infection risk Taking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening. a fever (high temperature) a cough or breathlessness burning when passing urine or passing blood in your urine diarrhoea You should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection – even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles . This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered). Rituximab dizziness vomiting nausea and diarrhoea headache difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) a cough, sore throat and blocked or runny nose joint pain increased risk of infections changes in blood pressure However, for some people, SLE can be a more serious condition that can cause life-threatening complications. Some of these complications are outlined below. Kidney problems Around 1 in every 3 people with SLE will develop a potentially serious kidney disease called lupus nephritis, which is caused by prolonged inflammation of the kidneys. swelling of your feet (oedema) headaches dizziness blood in your urine a frequent need to urinate Lupus nephritis can also cause high blood pressure (hypertension). If left untreated, it can put you at risk of developing life-threatening problems such as a heart attack or stroke . If you have SLE, it is likely you will need to have regular blood tests so the condition of your kidneys can be carefully monitored. If you develop lupus nephritis, it can usually be successfully controlled using immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. If you do become pregnant, you will need to be monitored closely by your specialist and by an obstetrician, so they can check for any problems. ","Diagnosing lupus SLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs. As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in certain people. Read more about the . Who is affected SLE is an uncommon condition where a round 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages. The condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin. How lupus is treated Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. The immune system is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it. In cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs. It’s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible. Possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below. Genetic factors Brothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large. Researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become “scrambled”, resulting in the body’s processes not working normally. Most faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction. Environmental factors A number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited. Possible environmental factors that have been suggested include: exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light) hormonal changes that occur during a woman’s lifetime, such as during puberty or pregnancy premature delivery miscarriage stillbirth Some children of women with SLE can also be born with heart block (where electrical pulses that control the beating of the heart are disrupted) and rashes. This is known as “neonatal lupus syndrome”. ","However, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as heart attack or stroke Anti-DNA antibody test An anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition. ","Complications of lupus About lupus . Outlook A few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed. Read more about the complications of lupus . Protecting yourself from the sun Immunosuppressants Rituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma rheumatoid arthritis . Side effects Common side effects of rituximab include: flu Belimumab It works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3 doses are given 14 days apart, and the medication is usually given once a month thereafter. Side effects Common side effects of belimumab include: Complications of lupus dialysis (where a machine is used to replicates many of the kidneys’ functions) or a kidney transplant. Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for any type of health condition that affects the heart and arteries. It is often associated with blood clots and atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries). Examples of CVD include coronary heart disease , angina (chest pain caused by the heart not receiving enough blood), heart attack and stroke. People with SLE are more likely to develop CVD than the general population, because SLE can cause your heart and arteries to become inflamed and damaged. If you have SLE, you can reduce your risk of CVD by making health lifestyle chances, such as: stopping smoking if you smoke eating a healthy, balanced diet low in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and containing at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day maintaining a healthy weight exercising regularly – at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) a week of exercise strenuous enough to leave you slightly out of breath is recommended cutting down on your alcohol consumption Pregnancy complications SLE does not usually affect fertility, but it can increase your risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as: pre-eclampsia ",
Loss of libido,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/loss-of-libido/,"Loss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to 1 in 5 men – and even more women – at some point in their life. It’s often linked to professional and personal stress, or important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. However, an unexpected loss of libido – especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning – can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem, which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship. ",,"Doctors at your nearest family planning clinic , Integrated Sexual Health clinic, or Contraceptive and Sexual Health (CASH) clinic may also be able to help. In the meantime, you may find the following information useful. It explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido. Relationship problems The first thing you should consider is whether you’re happy in your relationship. Do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire? If you’ve been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive. Relationships Scotland . Another thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. For example, many men experience ejaculation problems or erectile dysfunction , and women can experience painful sex or vaginismus (when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). See your GP if these problems are an issue, as they’re often treatable. Your GP may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. This is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido. Stress, anxiety and exhaustion Stress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you’re constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice. For more information and advice read about beating stress at work and 10 stress busters Depression Depression is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It’s a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life. You’re probably depressed if you’re feeling low or hopeless, or you’ve lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. In this case it’s really important to see your GP. They may feel you’ll benefit from antidepressants . However, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. Speak to your GP if you’re already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication. Drugs and alcohol Drinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it’s a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you’re a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you’re a woman. Read more about alcohol misuse and find out how to get support for a drinking problem . Drug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. Read more about drugs for information and advice. Getting older Many people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication. Older men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive. Speak to your GP if you’re concerned about this. They may carry out a blood test ",,"As women start to approach the menopause , levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. Women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after a hysterectomy . Testosterone is another hormone that can affect sex drive. Speak to your GP if you’re concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. They may be able to offer you a trial of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if it’s suitable for you. Hormonal problems Less commonly, low libido may be caused by an underactive thyroid . This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn’t produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed. An underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making. Learn more about . A hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. This is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood. Contraception Some women have reported a decreased sex drive while using some types of hormonal contraception, such as: combined contraception, including the combined pill , vaginal ring , or contraceptive patch the progestogen-only pill the contraceptive implant the Depo-Provera injection However, side effects of these contraceptives tend to improve within a few months and they’re generally well tolerated. Speak to your GP or local contraceptive (or family planning) clinic if you’re worried your contraception is causing a loss of libido. They may suggest trying an alternative method. Read more about choosing a method of contraception Other medical conditions Long-term (chronic) medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes and obesity can also have a negative effect on your libido. Medication Certain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as: medication for high blood pressure , including diuretics medications for depression, including SSRI antidepressants medications for seizures (fits) medications commonly used to treat psychosis (a mental condition where a person can’t distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions medicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone See your GP if you’re worried that medication you’re taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary. Find your local GP practice ",

Malnutrition,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/malnutrition/,"Malnutrition means poor nutrition. Most commonly this is caused by not eating enough (undernutrition) or not eating enough of the right food to give your body the nutrients it needs. A balanced diet should provide enough nutrients like calories, protein and vitamins, to keep you healthy. Without this, you may not be getting all the nutrients you need and this can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition can result in: unplanned weight loss muscle loss a low body mass index (BMI) vitamin and mineral deficiencies This can leave you feeling tired, weak and affect your ability to recover from an illness. ","Malnutrition can be difficult to recognise. It can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages. loss of appetite and lack of interest in food or fluids unplanned weight loss – this might cause clothing, rings, watches or dentures to become loose tiredness or low energy levels reduced ability to perform everyday tasks like showering, getting dressed or cooking reduced muscle strength – for example, not being able to walk as far or as fast as usual changes in mood which might cause feelings of lethargy and depression poor concentration poor growth in children increased risk of infection, recurrent infections, taking longer to recover and poor wound healing difficulty keeping warm dizziness Speak to your GP if: you notice a drop in weight or you’ve lost weight without trying Conditions that cause malnutrition Sometimes, medical conditions cause your body to need more nutrients. Some medical conditions can lead to your body being unable to absorb or use nutrients. These may include: cancer and liver disease that can cause a lack of appetite, persistent pain or nausea COPD , pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, which cause your body to need more nutrients but can reduce your appetite mental health conditions, like depression or schizophrenia , which may affect your ability to look after yourself Crohn’s disease , ulcerative colitis or cystic fibrosis that disrupt your body’s ability to digest food or absorb nutrients burns, fractures and post major surgery, due to increased demand for nutrients dementia – people with dementia may be unable to communicate their needs, may use up a lot of calories pacing or may experience a loss of appetite dysphagia – a condition that makes swallowing difficult or painful persistent vomiting or diarrhoea Some types and combinations of medication can increase your risk of developing malnutrition. Always check your medicines information and speak to a healthcare professional for advice if you have a concern. Do not stop taking your medication without advice from a healthcare professional. The most common types of feeding tube include: nasogastric – through your nose and into your stomach nasojejunal – though your nose and further into your digestive tract percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) – a tube is placed directly into the stomach via your abdomen Depending on your condition alternative routes of nutrition may be considered. ","Physical, social and ageing issues can also cause malnutrition. Physical issues Physical issues can contribute to malnutrition. For example: if your teeth are in a poor condition, if your dentures do not fit, or if you have a sore mouth, eating can be difficult or painful you may lose your appetite as a result of losing your sense of smell and taste you may have a physical disability or other physical impairment that makes it difficult for you to cook or shop for food yourself Social factors Social issues that can contribute to malnutrition include: living alone and being socially isolated having limited knowledge about nutrition or cooking reduced mobility alcohol or drug use low income or poverty reliance on food banks Ageing As we get older we might become more likely to experience malnutrition. This might be because of how we feel, and physical and social factors. The risk also increases because we’re more likely to have one or more medical conditions as we get older. Diagnosing malnutrition A healthcare professional can assess you for malnutrition using a screening tool like ‘Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool’ (‘MUST’) . Screen yourself for malnutrition ",,"If you’ve lost weight or your appetite is poor, you can make simple changes to your meals, snacks and drinks to help treat malnutrition. Choosing nutrient-dense food and drinks can help improve your calorie intake. This might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with other conditions like dysphagia. Ask your GP, dietitian or nurse for further advice if you’re unsure. You should speak to a healthcare professional if you’ve had to limit the fat and sugar you eat in the past due to a health condition like high cholesterol or diabetes. Ways to increase your calories Try the following ideas to help you to increase the amount of calories and protein in your diet.

Mesothelioma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/mesothelioma/,"Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body’s organs. It’s usually linked to asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60 to 80 and men are affected more commonly than women.

","Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction. These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos. The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. Read more about asbestos and people at risk of exposure and avoiding exposure to asbestos . How mesothelioma is diagnosed If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests. A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: an X-ray of your chest or tummy a computerised tomography (CT) scan – a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic ; a sample of tissue ( biopsy ) may be removed so it can be analysed These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread. ",,"chemotherapy radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpful ",

It’s caused by a strain of chlamydia bacteria. LGV is rare in Scotland and is mostly found in men who have sex with men . LGV in women is very rare. ,"swollen lymph glands in the groin (in one or both sides) an ulcer or sore on the penis, vagina or around the anus blood or pus from the anus on underwear or toilet paper pain in the anal area when pooing or having receptive anal sex constipation, painful straining or diarrhoea when trying to poo a feeling of incomplete emptying after pooing Testing for LGV If you think you might have LGV, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service contacting your GP practice for an appointment What does the LGV test involve? If you test positive for chlamydia The test for LGV is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. This can take up to 3 weeks. The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are: using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed Your partner (s) for the past 3 months should also be tested for LGV. ",,,"Antibiotics will treat the LGV infection. If left untreated, LGV can cause scarring and swelling of the skin. It can also cause permanent swelling of the genitals. Rectal infection can also cause swelling and scarring resulting in the risk of long-term bowel complications. Rarely the infection may spread via the bloodstream causing inflammation of the joints or liver. How LGV is passed on You can get LGV by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Your risk of getting LGV may be increased by: chemsex having group sex fisting sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used How to prevent LGV The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex . This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. Other STIs If you have been diagnosed with LGV you should get tested for all STIs including: gonorrhoea syphilis HIV ",

Types of malignant tumours Most malignant brain tumours develop from the glial tissue, which supports the brain’s nerve cells. These tumours are known as gliomas. Gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example: an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain’s framework an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain It’s also possible to have a malignant tumour that’s a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain. Who is affected Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. The exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it’s thought that certain genetic conditions and previous radiotherapy Read more about Signs of increased pressure on the brain severe, persistent headaches – which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing persistent nausea and vomiting drowsiness vision problems – such as blurred vision, floaters and loss of vision that may come and go seizures (fits) – which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one area the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell the temporal lobe may cause forgetfulness, language problems (aphasia) and seizures the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and numbness or weakness in one side of the body the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing ( dysphagia ) When to speak to your GP Read more about diagnosing malignant brain tumours . , such as a persistent and severe headache. Neurological examination Your GP or neurologist may carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a brain tumour. This may involve tests of your: hand and limb strength reflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex hearing and vision skin sensitivity balance and co-ordination memory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic) A neurologist may also recommend one or more further tests. Further tests Other tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include: a computerised tomography (CT) scan – this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of X-rays a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves an electroencephalogram (EEG) – where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalities If a tumour is suspected, a biopsy Chemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as: tablets (orally) – temozolomide and procarbazine are given in this way injections into a vein (intravenously) – vincristine is given in this way small, disc-like implants placed in the brain during surgery – carmustine can be given in this way, but is only recommended if 90% or more of the tumour has been removed The side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you’re taking. Common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy . These may include: anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits) corticosteroids to reduce swelling and pressure in the brain painkillers to treat headaches anti-emetics to prevent vomiting Depending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery. Recovering from malignant brain tumours After being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems. Follow-up appointments You will usually have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop. If you are required to give up your driving licence and notify the DVLA , they will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again. With up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle. You can find out about brain tumours and driving on the Cancer Research UK website. ","Diagnosing malignant brain tumours . How malignant brain tumours are treated A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord. Surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing. Most malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. These are known as secondary tumours. Cancers that can spread to the brain include lung cancer , breast cancer , bowel cancer and melanoma skin cancer . Some primary malignant brain cancers (cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previously benign brain tumour becoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary tumour develops is unknown. Age Brain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. Most tumours affect people over 50 years of age. Family history People with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing a brain tumour themselves. Radiotherapy If your brain is exposed to radiation during radiotherapy , your risk of developing certain types of brain tumour later on is increased. Genetic conditions Some genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as: neurofibromatosis type 1 or neurofibromatosis type 2 tuberous sclerosis Turcot syndrome Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau syndrome Gorlin syndrome Unlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop in childhood or early adulthood. Can mobile phones cause brain tumours? There have been reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted by mobile phones. RF energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it. However, it’s thought that the amount of RF energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature. Research is underway to establish whether RF energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it’s unlikely mobile phones cause health problems.

When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress. However, neglecting your own health doesn’t work in the long term. If you’re caring for someone else, it’s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It’s in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.

Social support ","Recovering from malignant brain tumours About malignant brain tumours A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine. Most malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain.

Living with a brain tumour Living with a brain tumour is not easy. You may feel worried and anxious about what’s going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal. You can read more about living with a brain tumour on The Brain Tumour Charity’s website . Under anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. You’ll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards. If you have a malignant brain tumour, you’ll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue. Surgery The main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. You will be given a general anaesthetic so you are asleep while the procedure is carried out. An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath. The surgeon can then remove as much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Possible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy . Chemotherapy Chemotherapy carmustine implants to treat gliomas and temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma . Radiosurgery Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a special type of radiotherapy that’s sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can’t be safely removed with surgery. As the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells. This means you’re less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. Recovery tends to be much faster and an overnight stay isn’t usually necessary. However, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the UK and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour. palliative care Problems caused by a brain tumour don’t always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated. For example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems. In these cases, you may need extra support to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have. This may include therapies such as: physiotherapy – to help with any movement problems you have occupational therapy – to identify any problems you’re having with daily activities and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help speech therapy – to help you with any communication or swallowing problems Some people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. For more information, see the service guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours. Driving and travelling Sports and activities After you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered. Sex and pregnancy Going back to work You may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it’s probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to. If you’ve experienced seizures, you shouldn’t work with machinery or at heights. Emotional support If you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. Your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need. Help you may need might include: a care attendant, who can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break a ‘meals on wheels’ service income support, disability living allowance or attendance allowance equipment and adaptations for your home For more information about what help you might need and how you can access it, visit Care Information Scotland .

Malaria,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/malaria/,About malaria ,"a high temperature (fever) headache sweats chills muscle aches or pains vomiting and or diarrhoea When to seek medical attention Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly. The effects of malaria are usually more severe in: babies young children pregnant women older people Phone 111 or go to A&E if: You must tell the healthcare professional that you have been in a country with a risk of malaria, including any brief stopovers. Types of malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale – fairly uncommon and usually found in West Africa. Plasmodium malariae – this is quite rare and usually only found in Africa. Plasmodium knowlesi – this is very rare and found in parts of southeast Asia. How malaria is spread The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise. When a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person. Although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions and sharing needles. Where is malaria found? Malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe. The fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries . Complications of malaria Anaemia The destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe anaemia . Anaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body’s muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint. Cerebral malaria In rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma. Other complications Other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include: liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) abnormally low blood sugar – hypoglycaemia kidney failure swelling and rupturing of the spleen dehydration Malaria in pregnancy If you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like: premature birth – birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy low birth weight restricted growth of the baby in the womb stillbirth miscarriage death of the mother Pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria. Visit your GP, midwife, obstetrician or travel health advisor for a full discussion if you’re pregnant and are thinking of travelling to a high-risk area. Not all antimalarial tablets are safe in pregnancy and it’s important you get specific advice. Preventing malaria Being aware of the risks Check whether you’re travelling to a malaria risk area on the fitfortravel website Visit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area. If you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. This means you need to protect yourself from infection if you’re now travelling to a risk area, even if that’s where you grew up. Further information about travel health and vaccinations . Preventing mosquito bites Avoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. This is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite. There are several steps you can take to avoid being bitten. Do mosquitoes can’t bite through clothing so wear light, loose-fitting clothing that will cover your arms and legs apply insect repellent to all areas of your skin that are not covered by clothing, including your face and neck remember to reapply insect repellent frequently sleep under a mosquito net that’s been treated with an insecticide, or in a room with effective air conditioning The most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (DEET). These are available in: sprays roll-ons sticks creams There’s no evidence to suggest that other remedies protect against malaria, such as homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers, vitamins B1 or B12 , garlic, yeast extract spread (Marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils. whether you took preventative antimalarial tablets your age whether you’re pregnant ",Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be. ,,"About malaria Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn’t diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal. A single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected. The type of medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on: the type of malaria you have ","Awareness of risk – find out whether you’re at risk of getting malaria fitfortravel website. Antimalarial tablets You must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. Antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area. How long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used. Antimalarial tablets don’t stop malaria from entering your body. However, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill. If you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the UK) you could still become ill with malaria. Taking antimalarial medication You may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. This is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. If you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave. Do make sure you get the right antimalarial tablets before you go – visit a travel health clinic for advice on which is the best antimalarial for you follow the instructions included with your tablets carefully make sure you complete the full course of tablets There’s currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria. Types of antimalarial medication The type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the following information: where you’re going any relevant family medical history your medical history, including any allergies to medication any medication you’re currently taking any problems you’ve had with antimalarial medicines in the past your age whether you’re pregnant If you’ve taken antimalarial medication in the past, don’t assume it’s suitable for future trips. The type of antimalarial that you will need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes in an area. It will also depend on whether they’re resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication. The main types of antimalarials used to prevent malaria are: Atovaquone plus proguanil (also known as Maloff protect or Malarone) Doxycycline (also known as Vibramycin-D) Mefloquine (also known as Lariam) To find out what type of antimalarial medication is best for you, visit your local travel clinic.

Measles,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/measles/,"Measles is an infection that spreads very easily. It’s unpleasant and can sometimes have serious complications. Having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent it.

You should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. Is measles serious? Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you’ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis). How measles is spread The measles virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours. How to prevent spreading measles to others If you have measles: stay off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears regularly wash your hands with soap use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze avoid close contact with anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the MMR vaccine . This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. You can be vaccinated at any age if you haven’t been fully vaccinated before. Do take paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration close the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity use damp cotton wool to clean the eyes ",,,,

The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves. Signs in young children As babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what’s wrong with them. Signs that a young child might have an ear infection include: raised temperature pulling, tugging or rubbing their ear irritability, poor feeding or restlessness at night coughing or a runny nose unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness loss of balance When to seek medical advice Most cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there’s usually no need to see your GP. However, see your GP if you or your child have: a lot of pain a discharge of pus or fluid from the ear – some people develop a persistent and painless ear discharge that lasts for many months, known as chronic suppurative otitis media an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease , which could make complications more likely Read more about diagnosing middle ear infections How middle ear infections are treated Read more about Grommets For children with recurrent severe middle ear infections, tiny tubes may be inserted into the eardrum to help drain fluid. These tubes are called grommets. Grommets are inserted under general anaesthetic , which means your child will be asleep and won’t feel any pain. The procedure usually only takes about 15 minutes and your child should be able to go home the same day. A grommet helps keep the eardrum open for several months. As the eardrum starts to heal, the grommet will slowly be pushed out of the eardrum and eventually falls out. This process happens naturally and shouldn’t be painful. Most grommets fall out within six to 12 months of being inserted. Some children need another procedure to replace the grommets if they’re still experiencing problems. a high temperature (fever) swelling behind the ear, which pushes it forward redness and tenderness or pain behind the ear a creamy discharge from the ear headache hearing loss Mastoiditis is usually treated in hospital with antibiotics given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). In some cases, surgery may be required to drain the ear and remove the infected mastoid bone. Cholesteatoma A cholesteatoma is an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear that can sometimes develop as a result of recurring or persistent middle ear infections. If it’s not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage the delicate structures deep inside your ear, such as the tiny bones that are essential for hearing. hearing loss weakness in half your face dizziness tinnitus – hearing sounds from inside their body rather than from an outside source In most cases, surgery is required to remove a cholesteatoma. Labyrinthitis In some cases, an infection in the middle ear can spread into the inner ear and affect the delicate structure deep inside the ear called the labyrinth. This is known as labyrinthitis . dizziness vertigo (the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning) loss of balance hearing loss severe headache being sick a high temperature (fever) stiff neck sensitivity to light rapid breathing a blotchy red rash that does not fade or change colour when you place a glass against it (although this is not always present) If you think your child may have meningitis, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

A brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of antibiotics and surgery. The surgeon will usually open the skull and drain the pus from the abscess or remove the abscess entirely. ","Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between six and 15 months old are most commonly affected. It’s estimated that around one in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they’re 10 years old. Most middle ear infections occur when an infection such as a cold This mean mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear. Younger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as: the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults a child’s adenoids are relatively much larger than an adults Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including: having a cleft palate – a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth having Down’s syndrome Can middle ear infections be prevented? It’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing the condition. These include: make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations – particularly the pneumococcal vaccine and the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccine avoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking) don’t give your child a dummy once they’re older than six to 12 months old don’t feed your child while they’re lying flat on their back if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk Avoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child’s chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection. Further problems Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur. Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including: the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis) the inner ear ( labyrinthitis ) the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) Rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum. If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital. Read more about the complications of middle ear infections Diagnosing middle ear infections A middle ear infection (otitis media) can usually be diagnosed using an instrument called an otoscope. An otoscope is a small handheld device with a magnifying glass and a light source at the end. Using an otoscope, a doctor can examine the ear to look for signs of fluid in the middle ear, which may indicate an infection. Signs of fluid in the middle ear can include the ear drum: bulging being an unusual colour (usually red or yellow) having a cloudy appearance In some cases, a hole may have developed in the eardrum (perforated ear drum) and there may be fluid in the ear canal (the tube between the outer ear and eardrum). Some otoscopes can also be used to blow a small puff of air into the ear to check for any blockages in the middle ear, which could be a sign of an infection. If the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects the throat and middle ear) is clear, the eardrum will move slightly. If it’s blocked, the eardrum will remain still. Further tests Meningitis A very rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection is meningitis . This can occur if the infection spreads to the protective outer layer of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges). ",,"Complications of middle ear infections About middle ear infections paracetamol or ibuprofen should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Read more about giving your child painkillers. Antibiotics Some of the tests that may be carried out are described below. Tympanometry Tympanometry is a test that measures how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure. During a tympanometry test, a probe is placed into your child’s ear. The probe changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. A measuring device is attached to the probe to record how the drum moves and how changes in air pressure affect this movement. A healthy ear drum should move easily if there’s a change in air pressure. If your child’s ear drum moves slowly or not at all, it usually suggests there’s fluid behind it. Audiometry Audiometry is a hearing test that uses a machine called an audiometer to produce sounds of different volume and frequency. This can help determine if your child has any hearing loss as a result of their condition. During the test, your child listens through headphones and is asked if they can hear the sounds. Scans On the very rare occasions where there’s a possibility the infection has spread out of the middle ear and into the surrounding area, a scan of the ear may be carried out. This may be either a: computerised tomography (CT) scan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan A CT scan takes a series of X-rays and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed image, whereas an MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the inside of the body. You can relieve any pain and a high temperature using over the counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen . Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Placing a warm flannel or washcloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain until the condition passes. Antibiotics Antibiotics aren’t routinely used to treat middle ear infections as there’s no evidence that they speed up the healing process. Many cases are caused by viruses, which antibiotics aren’t effective against. Using antibiotics to treat minor bacterial infections also increases the likelihood of bacteria becoming resistant to them over time. This means more serious infections could become untreatable in the future. Read about antibiotic resistance for more information. In some cases, your GP may give you a prescription that you can choose to pick up a few days later if the condition hasn’t improved by then. Adults and children who develop a long-term middle ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media) may benefit from short courses of antibiotic ear drops. Children Antibiotics are usually only considered if your child: has a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to complications, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease is less than three months old is less than two years old with an infection in both ears has discharge coming from their ear Adults Adults may be prescribed antibiotics if: they have a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to complications, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease Complications of middle ear infections Serious complications of middle ear infections (otitis media) are very rare but very young children are still at risk because their immune systems are still developing. Some of the main complications associated with middle ear infections are detailed below. Mastoiditis Mastoiditis can develop if an infection spreads out of the middle ear and into the area of bone underneath the ear (the mastoids). . Problems with speech and language development If your child has frequent ear infections that affect their hearing while they’re very young, there’s a risk their speech and language development may be affected. Contact your GP for advice if you’re concerned about your child’s development at any point. Facial paralysis In very rare cases, the swelling associated with otitis media can cause the facial nerve to become compressed. The facial nerve is a section of nerve that runs through the skull and is used by the brain to control facial expressions. Compression of the nerve can lead to a person being unable to move some or all of their face. This is known as facial paralysis. This can be frightening when it first occurs, as many parents are concerned their child may have experienced a stroke . Brain abscess Another very rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection is a brain abscess. This is a pus-filled swelling that develops inside the brain. ",
Migraine,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/migraine/,Migraine is a common health condition. It affects around 1 in every 5 women and around 1 in every 15 men. They usually begin in early adulthood. ,"There are several types of migraine, including: migraine with aura – where there are warning signs before the migraine begins, like seeing flashing lights migraine without aura – the most common type, where the migraine occurs without warning signs Some people have frequent migraines up to several times a week. Other people only have occasional migraines. It’s possible for years to pass between migraine attacks. The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck. The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation. The pain gets worse when you move and may prevent you from carrying out normal activities. nausea vomiting increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room sweating poor concentration feeling very hot or very cold abdominal (tummy) pain diarrhoea dizziness (light headedness) headache . visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue difficulty speaking Sometimes, you might also experience: feeling dizzy or off balance loss of consciousness – although this is unusual Speak to your GP if: Phone 999 if you or someone you’re with experiences: paralysis or weakness in one or both arms and/or one side of the face slurred or garbled speech a sudden agonising headache resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision and a rash stroke or meningitis . You should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. There are other types of medications that can cause some people to experience migraines. Speak to your GP if you start to experience migraines after starting to take new medication. Diagnosing migraines Your GP may ask if your headaches are: on one side of the head a pulsating pain severe enough to prevent you carrying out daily activities made worse by physical activity or moving about accompanied by nausea and vomiting accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise Migraine diary what medication you took (if any) Taking too many painkillers is a reason why migraines can become difficult to treat. This is called medication overuse headache. Keep a record of what painkillers you take and how often you take them. You shouldn’t take painkillers on more than 10 days every month in the long-term. It can be helpful to make a note when your start your period, if you have one. This can help your GP identify potential triggers. Read more about keeping a migraine diary on The Migraine Trust website. Referral to a specialist You shouldn’t wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers as it’s often too late for the medication to work. Soluble painkillers (tablets you dissolve in a glass of water) are a good option because they’re absorbed quickly by your body. Taking too many painkillers can lead to medication overuse headache. You should not take them more than 15 days per month. If you can’t swallow painkillers because of nausea or vomiting, you should speak to your GP about anti sickness medication or suppository options. Suppositories are capsules that you insert into the anus (back passage). Triptan medicines are a specific painkiller for migraine headaches. They’re thought to work by reversing the changes in the brain that may cause migraine headaches. Triptans are available as tablets, injections and nasal sprays. Common side effects of triptans include: warm-sensations tightness tingling flushing and light headedness feelings of heaviness in the face, throat, limbs or chest Some people also experience nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness. These side effects are usually mild and improve on their own. Taking too many triptans can lead to medication overuse headache. You should not take them more than 10 days per month. Side effects of anti-emetics include drowsiness and diarrhoea . Some anti-sickness medication can cause involuntary movements, normally in the face. Speak to your GP if you experience involuntary movements. Combination medicines You can buy some combination medicines for migraine without a prescription at your local pharmacy. These medicines contain both painkillers and anti-sickness medicines. If you’re not sure which one is best for you, ask your pharmacist. It can also be very effective to combine a triptan with another painkiller, like ibuprofen. magnesium vitamin B2 (rivoflavin) coenzyme Q10 acupuncture You should discuss any complementary therapies you’d like to try with your GP. Medical devices There are some devices that have been developed that might help treat migraines. These include: transcranial magnetic stimulation external trigeminal nerve stimulator non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation Read more about medical devices Advanced therapies for migraine The following medicines are advanced therapies for migraine that can only be prescribed by a neurologist. Botulinum toxin type A Botulinum toxin type A is used to prevent headaches in some adults with chronic migraines. Chronic migraines mean you have headaches more than 15 days per month and at least half of them are migraines, over a period of 3 months. stroke . Migraine clinic Mental health problems Migraine is associated with a very small increased risk of mental health problems, including: depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorder panic disorder ","The exact cause of migraines is unknown. They’re thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain. Around half of all people who experience migraines have a close relative with the condition. This suggests that genes may play a role. Migraine triggers It may help to keep a diary to see if you can identify a consistent trigger. It can be difficult to tell if something is a trigger or if what you’re experiencing is an early symptom of a migraine attack. There might not always be a trigger for your headache. Possible migraine triggers include: Hormonal changes Some women experience migraines around the time of their period. This might be because of changes in the levels of hormones like oestrogen around this time. These types of migraines usually occur between 2 days before the start of your period to 3 days after. Some women only experience migraines around this time. This is known as pure menstrual migraine. Most women experience them at other times too. This is called menstrual related migraine. Some women find their migraines become worse during perimenopause. However, they might improve or disappear a few years after your last period. Emotional triggers stress anxiety tension shock depression excitement Physical triggers tiredness poor quality sleep shift work poor posture neck or shoulder tension jet lag fasting or low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) strenuous exercise, if you’re not used to it Dietary triggers missed, delayed or irregular meals dehydration alcohol the food additive tyramine (found in some cheeses and cured meat) caffeine products, such as tea and coffee lack of caffeine (if you’re used to regular caffeine) specific foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit and cheese Some people crave chocolate before a migraine begins. This can be a sign that you’re about to have a migraine rather than the chocolate being the trigger for the migraine. Environmental triggers bright lights flickering screens, such as a television or computer screen smoking (or smoky rooms) loud noises strong smells changes in weather (windy weather or stuffy atmosphere) Medication some types of sleeping tablets the combined contraceptive pill hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Triptans can be taken at the same as painkillers and/or anti-sickness tablets to improve their effectiveness. Your GP will discuss this with you. Anti-sickness medicines Anti-sickness medicines, known as anti-emetics, can treat migraine in some people. They can be effective even if you don’t experience nausea or vomiting. They can be taken alongside painkillers and triptans. ",the date time what you were doing when the migraine began how long the attack lasted ,"Always make sure you read the medication instructions and follow the dosage recommendations. Children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin unless it’s under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Aspirin and ibuprofen are not recommended for adults who have a history of stomach problems, like stomach ulcers , liver problems or kidney problems. Painkillers Many people find that over-the-counter painkillers, like paracetamol , aspirin or ibuprofen Triptans If medication is essential, paracetamol and sumatriptan are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, speak to your GP or midwife: if you’re getting regular migraines before taking medication High doses of aspirin should not be taken to treat headaches during pregnancy. Preventing migraines It’s important to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle, including: regular exercise, sleep and meals ensuring you stay well hydrated limiting your intake of caffeine limiting your intake of alcohol One of the best ways of preventing migraines is recognising the things that trigger an attack and trying to avoid them. Preventative medication Medication is available to help prevent migraines. These medicines are usually used if your migraines remain frequent (more than 1 migraine per week) following a period of avoiding possible triggers. The following medications can be prescribed by your GP. If they’re not effective, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. The neurologist will consider what advanced therapies might be best to try next. Medications used to prevent migraines are taken every day to reduce the severity and frequency of headaches. It takes a few weeks to reach the right dose and you might need to take it for several weeks (usually 8 weeks once the right dose is reached) to find out if it works. Propranolol Propranolol is a medication used to treat angina and high blood pressure. It’s also effective in preventing migraines. It is taken every day in tablet form, regardless of whether you have a headache or not. Propranolol is not suitable for people with asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and some heart problems. It should be used with caution in people with diabetes . Side effects of propranolol can include: cold hands and feet pins and needles problems sleeping tiredness light headedness Tricyclic antidepressants You might be prescribed tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline. This is a type of medication used for depression but at lower doses can also help prevent migraines. The side effects can include: drowsiness a dry mouth weight gain difficulty passing urine Topiramate Topiramate is a type of medication originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy . It’s now much more commonly used in migraine. It’s been shown to help prevent migraines. It is taken every day in tablet form regardless of whether you have a headache or not. Topiramate should be used with caution in people with kidney stones, liver problems or glaucoma. You should not take topiramate during pregnancy as it can harm your unborn baby. You must be on an effective form of contraception when taking topiramate. Topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Your GP should discuss alternative methods of contraception if you’re prescribed topiramate. Side effects of topiramate can include: decreased appetite and weight loss nausea and vomiting constipation or diarrhoea tingling sensation memory problems and difficulty finding words problems sleeping Candesartan You might be prescribed Candesartan. Candesartan is a medication used for high blood pressure. Candesartan can cause lightheadedness due to low blood pressure, tiredness and cough. It should not be used if you’re pregnant or trying for a baby. Other oral preventive medications Other less common options of oral preventative medications for migraine include: pizotifen flunarizine Complementary therapies and supplements Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies CGRP might be prescribed if other medication has not prevented your migraines. This medication has been created specifically for migraines. Read more about CGRP Preventing menstrual-related migraines non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – a common type of painkiller (usually naproxen) triptans – a type of medication used to treat a migraine attack (usually naratriptan or frovatriptan) These medications are taken as tablets 2 to 4 times a day from either the start of your period or 2 days before, until the last day of bleeding. combined hormonal contraceptives, like the combined contraceptive pill , patch or vaginal ring (usually taken continuously for at least 3 months) progesterone-only contraceptives, such as progesterone-only pills , implants or injections oestrogen patches or gels, which can be used from 3 days before the start of your period and continued for 7 days Complications of migraines Migraines are linked to a very small increased risk of mental health problems. Migraines with aura are associated with a small increased risk of ischaemic strokes. Stroke An ischaemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or fatty material in the arteries. People who experience migraines with aura have about twice the risk of having an ischaemic stroke compared to people without migraines. However, this risk is still small. The risk increases significantly if you smoke and take the combined contraceptive pill. It’s unclear why ischaemic strokes are linked to migraine. Contraceptive pill The risk of having an ischaemic stroke is increased by the use of the combined contraceptive pill . Medical professionals generally advise women who experience migraine with aura not to use the combined contraceptive pill. Women who have migraine without aura can usually take the combined contraceptive pill safely, unless they have other stroke risk factors like high blood pressure or a family history of cardiovascular disease .

Motor neurone disease (MND),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/motor-neurone-disease-mnd/,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND. MND happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly and die prematurely. This is known as neurodegeneration. Motor neurones control muscle activity like: gripping walking speaking swallowing breathing As MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities. ","Speak to your GP if: Being referred to a specialist as early as possible can help you access the right support. Limb-onset disease a weakened grip, which can cause problems picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder, making lifting your arm above your head difficult tripping up over your foot because of weakness at your ankle or hip Bulbar-onset disease These problems might initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. Increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of MND. It might be misdiagnosed as a stroke . As the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia). This might be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat. Respiratory-onset disease In rare cases, MND starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. This is called respiratory-onset disease. You might suffer from a lack of sleep and a headache in the morning. This might be because your body isn’t getting rid of the carbon dioxide you normally breathe out. As MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker. The limbs will become weaker. The muscles in the limbs may become thinner. As a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs. The limbs may also become stiff. This is known as spasticity. Both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains. Speaking and swallowing difficulties Speaking and swallowing can become increasingly difficult as MND progresses. Choking episodes can be distressing but they aren’t usually the cause of death. Saliva problems Reduced swallowing can cause excess saliva. This can cause drooling. Thicker saliva can sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat. This is because the muscles that control coughing become weak. Excessive yawning Some people with MND have episodes of uncontrollable excessive yawning. This can happen even when they’re not tired. It can sometimes cause jaw pain. Emotional changes MND can cause changes in your ability to control your emotions. This is more likely when there’s weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing. One of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. This is sometimes called emotional lability or emotionality. Changes to mental abilities Sometimes, people with MND have significant difficulties with: concentration planning communication behavioural changes. This is where the condition is causing a type of dementia (usually frontotemporal dementia). Breathing difficulties Breathing might become less efficient as the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become more damaged. This might mean you feel short of breath after doing every day tasks like walking up the stairs. Over time, you might become even more out of breath when you’re resting. Shortness of breath can become a problem at night. Some people find it difficult to breathe when they’re lying down. Others might wake in the night because they feel breathless. As breathlessness increases, breathing support can help reduce this symptom. This is usually given by non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support. It can be useful at night to improve your sleep quality. This can help reduce drowsiness during the day. As MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience: increasing body paralysis, which means you’ll need help with most daily activities significant shortness of breath depression , insomnia and anxiety . a trapped nerve – wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped under the spine peripheral neuropathy – where part of the nervous system is damaged by another condition, like type 2 diabetes swallowing difficulties caused by narrowing or inflammation of the gullet speech difficulties due to problems with the voice box damage to the brain by stroke or other neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) in younger people Initial testing blood tests – these can be used for several reasons, like checking that organs are working, or to look for a marker of muscle damage (creatinine kinase) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – to give a detailed picture of your brain and spinal cord electromyography (EMG) – measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles nerve conduction test – similar to an EMG but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal lumbar puncture – a sample of spinal fluid might be tested to exclude an inflammatory or nerve condition caused by an infection muscle biopsy – in rare cases, a small sample of muscle might be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the muscles Gene tests A team of healthcare professionals will work together to help care for you. This multidisciplinary team typically includes: a neurologist and an MND care specialist a specialist in breathing (respiratory specialist) physiotherapists to advise on mobility aids occupational therapists to assess the need for adaptations to living environments speech and language therapist to provide help with communication and swallowing dieticians to support nutrition As the conditions advances, you might also need palliative care. Riluzole Riluzole is the only licensed medication in the UK that’s shown a survival benefit for people with MND. Riluzole is thought to slow down the damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate. In medical research, riluzole extended survival by 2 to 3 months on average. Side effects of riluzole are usually mild and can include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat. Very rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. If you’re prescribed riluzole you’ll need to have blood tests for the first few months to check your liver is working properly. If you’ve had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you. Muscle cramps Physiotherapy can help muscle cramps. In some cases, a medication called quinine can help treat muscle cramps too. They often improve later in the condition. Quinine can cause side effects like: hearing and vision problems tinnitus – the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head vertigo – a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving Quinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. Muscle stiffness Muscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication like baclofen. This helps to help relax the muscles. Side effects can include increased weakness or tiredness. Drooling Medication is available to treat drooling of saliva. One option is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch. Alternative medicines used to control drooling include: amitriptyline atropine eye drops applied to the tongue glycopyrronium botulinum toxin injections into the glands that produce saliva Communication difficulties Not everyone with MND will have significant speech problems. There are ways to help people who find it hard to communicate. A speech and language therapist can teach you techniques to make your voice as clear as possible. As the disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you communicate. A range of communication aids is available. Your therapist will be able to tell you about the most effective communication aids for you. Swallowing difficulties Not everyone with MND will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). For those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. This can lead to you feeling more tired. If food or fluid goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration). ","MND occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively fail. It’s not clear why this happens. Having a family history of frontotemporal dementia can also increase the risk of inheriting MND. The error in the gene affects the cells ability to perform normally and survive. If you have a genetic form of MND, there’s a chance that you could pass the risk of developing MND on to your child. The risk of them developing the condition can be affected by many factors like age. Not everyone who has the genetic mutation will develop MND in their lifetime. Typically, the longer you live, the more likely you are to develop the condition. If you have a parent with MND with no other family history of the disease, you’re at a slight increased risk of MND of about 1.4%. The risk to the general population of MND is about 0.3%. It’s unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it’s a combination of factors that affect either the motor neurones or the cells that support them. There are some theories involving different cell processes including: Aggregates and RNA processing Aggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. They’re found in nearly all cases of MND and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones. It can also be a marker that the cell is under stress. The protein TDP-43 is most commonly found in these aggregates. This is a protein involved in the processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as RNA. Mutations in the gene (TARDBP) coding for this protein can be a cause of genetic cases of MND. Cell transport disruption All cells have transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. Over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity and aging. The body gets rid of the toxic waste by waste disposal systems that can be affected by ageing and the environment. Glial cells Glial cells surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients. When they don’t work properly the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally. Their involvement in MND is still being researched. Glutamate Riluzole, a drug used to treat MND reduces the level of neuronal activity by blocking the action of Glutamate. Mitochondria Mitochondria are the “batteries” of cells. They provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. Mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with MND might not function properly. Diagnosing motor neurone disease ","Being told you have MND can be devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first. Talking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist might help with feelings of depression and anxiety . It’s not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with MND go on to do this. You should discuss these thoughts with your doctor. Taking antidepressants or medicines to reduce anxiety may help. Your care team will be able to tell you about this. ","Ideally you should have the tube inserted before you become too frail. This is so you can get the best out of it and to give yourself the best chance of recovering from the procedure. If you have thick secretions (fluids) you can’t cough up yourself, medicine like carbocisteine and acetylcysteine might help. Breathing difficulties As MND progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker. Your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough. Breathing difficulties usually develop gradually. They’re sometimes the first sign of MND, although this is rare. It’s important to discuss breathing problems with your GP before they occur. Your GP or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory (breathing) specialist or a palliative care specialist, depending on your needs. You might benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) to support your breathing. Room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box. It’s filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time you take a breath. NIV may not be suitable for everyone with MND. Your healthcare team will be able to discuss the options available to you. Advance decision making Issues that can be covered by an advance decision include: whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of MND the type of medication you’d be willing to take in certain circumstances whether you’d be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function), whether you wish to have artificial resuscitation, like having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy) whether you’d be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with MND are very important for ongoing research) Your care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about making an advance decision. Read more about end of life care Research and drug trials You might be given the opportunity to take part in research, including drug trials. Your MND care specialist and neurology consultant can provide further information on this. Advice for carers Caring for someone with MND can be both physically and emotionally demanding. It’s likely you’ll need a wide range of support. For information and advice about all aspects of caring, visit Care Information Scotland ",
Miscarriage,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/miscarriage/,"A miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 24 weeks. Early miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Late miscarriages happen between 12 and 24 weeks. Most of the time there’s no clear reason why it happens, but it’s very unlikely to be caused by anything you did or didn’t do. About 1 out of 5 pregnancies miscarry. Since many miscarriages aren’t recorded the figure might be higher. Always get medical help if: you’re bleeding from your vagina you’ve got strong, cramping pain your waters break your baby’s movements have changed, or you haven’t felt them move for a while If you’re registered, contact your midwife or local maternity unit. If you’re not registered, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service. ","You might be having an early miscarriage if: you’re bleeding from your vagina you’ve cramps in your lower abdomen – these can feel like bad period pains there’s fluid or tissue coming from your vagina your breasts are no longer tender and any morning sickness has passed Bleeding Having some light bleeding’s fairly common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a miscarriage. If you start bleeding, you should always contact your GP or midwife and get advice about what to do. What happens during an early miscarriage If you’re in the early weeks of pregnancy: you’ll probably be asked to go to the early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan your body usually completes the miscarriage naturally Depending on your stage of pregnancy, you may deliver a small baby. That can be a shock and is an understandably upsetting time. Late miscarriages A late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks. For many parents who lose their baby after a late miscarriage, the word ‘miscarriage’ doesn’t properly express the impact of their loss. The loss of a baby at any time’s a terrible shock and a late miscarriage can be especially hard. You might be having a late miscarriage if: you’re bleeding from your vagina – this can be heavy and you might have blood clots you’ve strong, cramping pains Always get medical help if: you’re bleeding your baby’s movements have changed or you haven’t felt any movements for a while. your waters break and your baby’s born very quickly Contact your midwife or local maternity unit if you’re registered with them. If you’re not registered, contact your GP or phone the NHS 24 111 service. What happens during a late miscarriage If you’re later on in pregnancy: you may be asked to go to the maternity ward you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan you’re likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour induced While you deliver your baby you’re likely to have heavier bleeding and labour-like pains. Making difficult decisions If you’re having a miscarriage, your doctor or midwife will: talk to you about what will happen next help you, and your partner if you have one, decide what you’d like to do You may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. Take your time. Your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby’s father and your family. Get support from SANDS Get support from SiMBA After a miscarriage Depending on your circumstances and stage of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor may ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby. Some parents decide they don’t want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. This is a decision only you can make. It can be very hard when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Whatever you decide is okay. If you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Some women may need medicine or a short operation to treat this. ",Doctors think most miscarriages are caused when the building blocks controlling the development of a baby (the chromosomes) aren’t right. Babies with too many or not enough chromosomes won’t develop properly. This leads to a miscarriage. Miscarriages can also be caused by: issues with your placenta cervical weakness – when your cervix (neck of your womb) starts to open Early miscarriages An early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. Many women have a miscarriage before they even know they’re pregnant. If this happens it can feel like a late period with heavy bleeding. ,,"Taking time off work Many women will want to take time off work after having a miscarriage. If you have a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to: take sick leave any sick pay you’d normally qualify for If you lose your baby after the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to: take maternity leave any maternity pay you qualify for Speak to your employer about which choices may be right for you and your family. Working Families has more about your rights at work after a miscarriage Repeated miscarriages Most women go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby after a miscarriage. But unfortunately, some women have repeated miscarriages. If you’ve had: 1 or 2 miscarriages – you’re not more likely than anyone else to have another one 3 or more miscarriages – your GP can refer you to a specialist to see whether there’s a specific cause ",
Multiple sclerosis (MS),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,,"MS Society estimates that there are more than 130,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK. It’s often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It’s about two to three times more common in women than men. Muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness MS can cause your muscles to: feel weak become stiff and resistant to movement (spasticity) contract tightly and painfully (spasm) Vision problems In around 1 in 4 cases of MS, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of your eyes (optic neuritis). You may experience: some temporary loss of vision in the affected eye, usually lasting for days to weeks colour blindness eye pain, which is usually worse when moving the eye flashes of light when moving the eye You might also experience double vision or involuntary eye movements, which can make it seem as though objects are jumping around. Abnormal sensations You might have persistent numbness or tingling in different parts of your body which can last a few days to weeks. Mobility problems MS can make walking and moving around difficult, particularly if you also have muscle weakness and spasticity. You may experience: clumsiness difficulty with balance and co-ordination (ataxia) shaking of the limbs (tremor) dizziness and vertigo , which can make it feel as though everything around you is spinning Pain Some people with MS experience pain which can take two forms. Pain caused by MS itself (neuropathic pain) This is pain caused by damage to the nervous system, and can include: stabbing pains in the face stabbing sensations in the torso (body) and limbs feeling like you’re burning pins and needles feeling like you’re being hugged or squeezed Muscle spasms can sometimes be painful. Musculoskeletal pain This can be back, neck and joint pain particularly if you have problems walking or moving around. Bladder problems Bladder problems are common in MS. They may include: having to pee more often having a sudden, urgent need to pee, which can lead to unintentionally passing urine ( urge incontinence ) difficulty emptying the bladder completely having to get up during the night to pee recurrent urinary tract infections What happens when someone has MS MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it. In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body. The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . When the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage. If your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment. Some of the tests you may need to confirm MS are: neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan lumbar puncture blood test Types of MS the results of an MRI scan Disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They’re only prescribed to those with either: relapsing remitting MS secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they’ve had primary progressive MS who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an MRI scan Fatigue Your healthcare professional should give you advice about ways to manage fatigue. This might include exercise, keeping healthy sleep patterns and energy-saving techniques. Your healthcare professional might suggest avoiding medications that can worsen fatigue. Specialist fatigue management courses or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), might also help. Visual problems If you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medication like gabapentin can sometimes help. Some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists). Muscle spasms and stiffness Physiotherapy can help improve muscle spasms and stiffness. Techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted. If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine. These medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your specialist MS nurse. Mobility problems Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness can also cause mobility problems. If you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest: an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist special exercises called vestibular rehabilitation, if you have problems with balance medication for dizziness or tremors mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings An occupational therapist can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations. Musculoskeletal pain Living with MS can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body. A physiotherapist might be able to help with this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions. If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves. Neuropathic pain Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation. This type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers. Problems with thinking, learning and memory Your MS healthcare professionals can assess your thinking, learning and memory problems and suggest ways to manage them. Emotional problems People with MS who have depression or anxiety can be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as CBT. ","Bowel problems Many people with MS also have problems with their bowel function. Constipation is the most common problem. You may find passing stools (poo) difficult and pass them much less than normal. Bowel incontinence is less common, but is often linked to constipation. If a poo becomes stuck, it can irritate the wall of the bowel, causing it to produce more fluid and mucus that can leak out of your bottom. Some of these problems aren’t specific to MS and can be the result of medications. Sexual problems MS can have an effect on sexual function. For women, problems include difficulty reaching orgasm. They might experience decreased vaginal lubrication and sensation. Men with MS might find it hard to get or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ). They may also find it takes a lot longer to ejaculate when having sex or masturbating. They might lose the ability to ejaculate altogether. Both men and women with MS may find they’re less interested in sex than they were before. This could be directly related to MS, a mood disorder like depression, or it could be the result of living with the condition. Speech and swallowing difficulties Some people with MS have difficulty chewing or swallowing ( dysphagia ) at some point. They might also slur their speech or be difficult to understand (dysarthria). Fatigue Feeling fatigued is a common and troublesome symptom of MS. It can cause an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that means it’s a struggle to carry out simple tasks. Fatigue tends to get worse: towards the end of each day in hot weather after exercising during illness Mental health issues Many people with MS experience periods of depression. It’s unclear if this is directly caused by MS, or is due to the stress of having to live with a long-term condition, or both. Anxiety can also be a problem for people with MS, possibly due to the unpredictable nature of the condition. In rare cases, people with MS can experience rapid and severe mood swings. Problems with thinking, learning and planning Some people with MS have problems with thinking, learning and planning. This is known as cognitive dysfunction and can include: problems learning and remembering new things although long-term memory is usually unaffected slowness in processing lots of information or multi-tasking a shortened attention span getting stuck on words problems with understanding and processing visual information, such as reading a map difficulty with planning and problem solving – people often report that they know what they want to do, but can’t grasp how to do it problems with reasoning, such as mathematical laws or solving puzzles Many of these problems aren’t specific to MS. They can be caused by other conditions, including depression and anxiety or medication. Speak to your GP if: Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn’t known. It’s not caused by anything you’ve done and it’s not clear if you can prevent it. It’s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition. Some of the factors that might cause MS include: Your genes MS isn’t directly inherited, but if you’re related to someone with the condition you’re more likely to develop it. The chance of a sibling or child of someone with MS also developing it is around 2-3%. Lack of sunlight and vitamin D MS is more common in countries far from the equator. This could mean that a lack of sunlight and low vitamin D levels may play a role in the condition. It’s not clear whether vitamin D supplements can help prevent MS. Smoking People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop MS compared to those who don’t smoke. Viral infections Infections, particularly those caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, (responsible for glandular fever ), might trigger the immune system, leading to MS in some people. More research will help us understand why MS occurs and whether it can be prevented or not. Diagnosing multiple sclerosis ",This will largely be based on: ,"Phone your specialist MS nurse or GP if: you think you’re having a relapse Although there isn’t a cure for MS, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs. These reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses. Steroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse. They don’t prevent further relapses or stop MS getting worse over time. Steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible steroid side effects . The side effects could include infection, mood disturbance, stomach ulceration, osteoporosis (weak bones) , weight gain and diabetes . Not using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will help to reduce the risk of side effects. Bladder problems Medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night. If you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder. Sometimes a catheter can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC). In rare cases, people with MS may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely. . Bowel problems It might be possible to treat mild to moderate constipation by changing your diet or taking laxatives . More severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools. Anti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence. Sexual problems If you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help. If you have MS and find it hard to get or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) you may be prescribed medication to increase the blood flow to the penis. Speech and swallowing difficulties A speech and language therapist can help you find ways to overcome problems with speech and swallowing. For example, they can offer advice about foods that are easy to swallow. They might recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles used in speech and swallowing. Complementary and alternative therapies for MS Some people with MS find that complementary therapies Clinical trials Speak to your care team if you’re interested in taking part in a clinical trial. Support for living with multiple sclerosis Coming to terms with a long-term condition like MS can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. Be honest about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. If you have any questions, your MS nurse or GP can help and will let you know what support is available. If you find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able to provide you with some help. Ask for a care and support needs assessment. For more information, read about assessing your care and support needs . Having a baby Being diagnosed with MS shouldn’t affect your ability to have children. Women with MS can have a normal pregnancy, deliver a healthy baby and breastfeed. Some of the medications prescribed for MS aren’t suitable for taking during pregnancy or breastfeeding and might affect fertility in males and females. If you’re considering starting a family, discuss it with your healthcare team. Having a baby doesn’t affect the long-term course of MS. Relapses can be less common in pregnancy, but they can be more common in the months after giving birth. Money and financial support If you have to stop work or work part-time because of your MS, you may find it hard to cope financially. You might be able to get financial support . Driving If you have MS, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and inform your insurance company. You might be able to continue driving, but you’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition. You’ll be asked for details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive. ",
Mouth cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/mouth-cancer/,About mouth cancer ,"red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue ulcers a lump Types of mouth cancer A cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer starts in. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin. Less common types of mouth cancer include: oral malignant melanoma – where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour adenocarcinomas – cancers that develop inside the salivary glands Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat. red or white patches in the mouth or throat a lump ulcers persistent pain in the mouth pain or difficulty when swallowing ( dysphagia ) changes in your voice, or speech problems swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck unexplained weight loss bleeding or numbness in the mouth a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason difficulty moving your jaw When to seek medical advice Dental check-ups This is why it’s important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination. You should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of tooth decay or gum disease . If mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon. Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . Biopsy It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a biopsy . There are 3 main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer. Punch biopsy A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth. The area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers. The procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer. Your neck is numbed and a needle is used to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then checked for cancerous cells. FNA is not painful but it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising. Panendoscopy A panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities. This is a long thin tube with a camera and a light which is guided through the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy. The panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe). Further tests If the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached. If the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system – a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system. Once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs. However, it’s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs. Therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours. These tests may include: an X-ray a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a positron emission tomography (PET) scan Further biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out. Staging and grading Once these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is: staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future This will help determine whether you have: early mouth cancer (usually curable) intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable) or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan) There are 3 grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive). Grading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated. Read more about ","Diagnosing mouth cancer Mouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Risk factors for developing mouth cancer include: smoking or using products that contain tobacco drinking alcohol – smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large genital warts Read more about the Who is affected by mouth cancer? Mouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer. Most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50 and 74 years old. Mouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it’s thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people. Mouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women. Both alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer . The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker. Exactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain. How mouth cancer spreads There are 2 ways mouth cancer can spread: directly – the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw via the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands found throughout your body which produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection Mouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer. Other risk factors Other risk factors for mouth cancer may include: chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus chewing betel nuts with or without tobacco a poor diet the human papilloma virus (HPV) poor oral hygiene Smokeless tobacco There is a range of smokeless tobacco products including: chewing tobacco snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted snus – a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip Smokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer. Betel nuts Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin. They have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco. Due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large. Diet There is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer. A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV) The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat. You can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected – you do not have to have ‘full sex’; just close skin-to-skin contact. There is evidence that in rare cases, certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer. Poor oral hygiene There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay , gum disease , not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer. Diagnosing mouth cancer ",This type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Signs that you may be depressed include: feeling down or hopeless during the past month no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy ,"Complications of mouth cancer Living with mouth cancer About mouth cancer Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums. Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common. surgery – where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue chemotherapy – where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells radiotherapy – where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells Read more about Complications of mouth cancer Both surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult ( dysphagia ). Dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia . Read more about the complications of mouth cancer Reducing the risk not smoking keeping to the recommended limits for alcohol consumption eating a ‘Mediterranean-style diet’, with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about healthy eating ) It’s also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer. . If the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Your specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking. Read more about quitting smoking and cutting down on alcohol Surgery Photodynamic therapy (PDT) If the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour. Other forms of surgery If your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest. If your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue. If the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place. Occasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer. These can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected. During surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can’t be detected. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring. While it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including: sore, red skin (like sunburn) mouth ulcers sore mouth and throat dry mouth loss of, or changes in taste loss of appetite tiredness feeling sick stiff jaw bad breath Any side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible. The side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete. Internal radiotherapy Internal radiotherapy – also called brachytherapy – is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic. They will be left for between 1 and 8 days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth. Visits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won’t be able to visit you. The radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain 5 to 10 days after the implants are removed. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning. Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce. Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include: fatigue (tiredness) sore mouth mouth ulcers feeling sick being sick hair loss tiredness Chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection. Cetuximab Cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading. are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated) are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant) Complications of mouth cancer Difficulty swallowing Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. It’s easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid for granted, but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted. Surgery and radiotherapy can affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. This can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia. If you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (SLT) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. One way an SLT can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. The dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using X-rays your SLT can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs. If this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. The SLT will teach you exercises so you can ‘relearn’ how to swallow properly. Your ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. However, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover. In some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. A dietitian can give you dietary advice. Read more detailed information about how dysphagia is treated Speech Much like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth). Radiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. In severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood. An SLT will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds. Emotional impact The emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect. antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Read more about depression and coping with cancer Living with mouth cancer If you have cancer you’re covered by the Disability Discrimination Act . This means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. Examples of these include: allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment The definition of what is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. For example, how much it would affect your employer’s business. It will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. Talk to your human resources department if you have one. Your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice. If you’re having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your local Citizens Advice Bureau . Relationships with others It is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. Do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need. Money and financial support If you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support: if you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you don’t have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance if you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income Find out as early as possible what help is available to you. Speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need. Talk to others If you have questions, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these. Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as: Cancer Research UK: Cancer chat Macmillan Cancer Support: Head and neck cancer forum Caring for others with mouth cancer Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress. If you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for. Look after your health Eat regularly and healthily. If you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least 1 of your day’s meals. Instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit. Look after your emotional health As well as exhaustion, isolation and worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. These feelings are natural. Look for support Friends and family may not always understand what you are going through and it can be helpful to talk to people in the same situation.

Who’s affected? Most cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine . Once you’ve had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again. How mumps is spread The mumps virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch mumps by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. ",,

The infection can also be spread by someone with meningitis, although this is less common. It’s possible to get meningitis more than once. Who’s most at risk? Anyone can potentially get meningitis, but it’s more common in: babies and young children teenagers and young adults elderly people people with a weak immune system – for example, those with HIV and those having chemotherapy You can reduce the risk of getting meningitis by ensuring all your vaccinations are up-to-date. Read more about meningitis vaccinations You may also find it useful to get in touch with organisations such as the Meningitis Research Foundation or Meningitis Now for support and advice about life after meningitis. Preventing meningitis Meningitis can be caused by a number of different infections, so several vaccinations offer some protection against it. Children should receive most of these as part of the NHS vaccination schedule. Speak to your GP if you’re not sure whether your or your child’s vaccinations are up-to-date. Meningitis B vaccine The meningitis B vaccine offers protection against meningococcal group B bacteria, which are a common cause of meningitis in young children in the UK. The vaccine is recommended for babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at one year. 6-in-1 vaccine The 6-in-1 vaccine, also known as the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine, offers protection against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough , polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and hepatitis B. Hib are a type of bacteria that can cause meningitis. The vaccine is given on three separate occasions when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. More about the 6-in-1 vaccine Pneumococcal vaccine The pneumococcal vaccine offers protection against serious infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria, including meningitis. Babies receive the pneumococcal vaccine as 2 separate injections, at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old. More about the pneumococcal vaccine Hib/Men C vaccine The meningitis C vaccine offers protection against a type of bacteria – meningococcal group C bacteria – that can cause meningitis. Babies are offered a combined Hib/Men C vaccine at 1 year of age. Teenagers and first-time university students are also offered vaccination against meningococcal group C bacteria as part of the combined meningitis ACWY vaccine. More about the Hib/Men C vaccine MMR vaccine The MMR vaccine offers protection against measles , mumps and rubella . Meningitis can sometimes occur as a complication of these infections. The vaccine is usually given to babies at 1 year of age. They’ll then have a second dose when they’re 3 years and 4 months old. More about the MMR vaccine Meningitis ACWY vaccine The meningitis ACWY vaccines offers protection against 4 types of bacteria that can cause meningitis – meningococcal groups A, C, W and Y. Young people who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school are advised to have the vaccination.

You’ll usually be able to go home from hospital if you or your child has mild meningitis and tests show it’s being caused by a viral infection. This type of meningitis will normally get better on its own without causing any serious problems. Most people feel better within 7 to 10 days. In the meantime, it can help to: get plenty of rest take painkillers for a headache or general aches take anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medicine for any vomiting Preventing the spread of infection The risk of someone with meningitis spreading the infection to others is generally low. But if someone is thought to be at high risk of infection, they may be given a dose of antibiotics as a precautionary measure. This may include anyone who has been in prolonged close contact with someone who developed meningitis, such as: people living in the same house pupils sharing a dormitory a boyfriend or girlfriend People who have only had brief contact with someone who developed meningitis won’t usually need to take antibiotics. Complications of meningitis Most people make a full recovery from meningitis, but it can sometimes cause serious, long-term problems and can be life threatening.

",Diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer ,"radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells In most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used. Surgery isn’t usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it’s difficult for surgeons to access the affected area. Radiotherapy In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used. It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned. External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won’t need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments. Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as: feeling sick changes to your sense of taste dry mouth hair loss Read more about how radiotherapy is performed and the side effects of radiotherapy Chemotherapy Chemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers. Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as: feeling sick diarrhoea sore mouth tiredness Read more about how chemotherapy is performed and the side effects of chemotherapy Follow-up To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll become gradually less frequent over time.

Your child’s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue ,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts. ‘Neuro’ means nerve ‘Blast’ means cells in early development ‘Oma’ means a group of cells, or a tumour Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. Biopsy A small sample of cells (a biopsy Staging Stage 1 The cancer is contained within 1 area of the body (localised) and there’s no evidence of it having spread. It can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left. Stage 2A The cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery. Stage 2B The cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes. Stage 3 The cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body. Stage 4 The cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs. Stage 4S (also called special neuroblastoma) This stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under 1 year old. The cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2A or 2B) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow. Stage L1 The tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. It can be removed by surgery. Stage L2 The tumour is localised but has ‘image-defined risk factors’ and can’t be safely removed by surgery. Stage M The tumour has spread to other parts of the body. Stage MS The tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old. Surgery Chemotherapy Radiotherapy External beam radiotherapy may be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. This uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. External beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive MIBG. Radioactive MIBG is similar to the MIBG used in an investigation to diagnose neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells. Younger children Children under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have ‘low-risk’ tumours, and as long as there is no MYCN amplification, their outlook is excellent. Most children in this age group are cured. Clinical trials Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",

However, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems. Bone pain Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement. Bone fractures and spinal cord compression Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected. Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back). Compression of the spinal cord can cause pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels. Anaemia Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells ( anaemia thirst , feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently, constipation , confusion and drowsiness. Unusual bleeding Bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage) – such as frequent nosebleeds , bleeding gums and heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made. Thickened blood In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision, headaches , dizziness , bleeding from the gums or nose, and shortness of breath . Kidney problems Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by the cancer cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also cause kidney damage. Eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include: weight loss and poor appetite swollen ankles, feet or hands tiredness and a lack of energy shortness of breath itchy skin feeling sick When to seek medical advice Read more about diagnosing multiple myeloma and However, every year around 1 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma. There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so ongoing outpatient tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have MGUS. Other factors As well as MGUS, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including: age – your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare gender – men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women ethnicity – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations It has also been suggested that having a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or HIV ), being overweight or obese , and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. However, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear. Diagnosing multiple myeloma You may need urine and blood tests to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins). If multiple myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and scans. Blood tests A number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition. These may include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV) – if you have multiple myeloma, your ESR or PV will usually be raised tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells a full blood count (FBC) to check levels of different types of blood cells – your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets liver and kidney function blood calcium level Urine tests A urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. The abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains, or Bence Jones protein. These proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. You may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. This will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working. X-rays and other scans You will have X-rays taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage. Other scans, such as computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans , may also be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy A bone marrow biopsy is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. A needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. A sample of bone may also be removed. This is carried out using a local anaesthetic (the area where the needle is inserted is numbed). The sample of bone marrow and bone will be used to check for cancerous plasma cells. chest pain and breathlessness . Bortezomib Bortezomib (Velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them. There are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you. The medication is given by injection, usually under the skin. Possible side effects include: tiredness nausea diarrhoea numbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) Stem cell transplant ","Diagnosing multiple myeloma people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) – an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood men adults over 60 – most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare black people – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations Read more about the . How multiple myeloma is treated In multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body’s blood cells. Plasma cells are normally produced in a controlled way. In cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. These fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells. The exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) In almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had MGUS. ",,"About multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body’s blood cells. Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. Myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. Myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs. Read more about diagnosing multiple myeloma Who is affected? Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer. a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses) Read more about Support groups If you’ve been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to contact a local or national support group, such as Myeloma UK . Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences. The Myeloma UK website has more information about how they can help you and finding a local support group . If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless. Repeated infections People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). You may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time. Raised calcium levels in the blood A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream. If you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma. to bring the myeloma under control to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as anaemia and bone pain smouldering myeloma . Bringing myeloma under control non-intensive – for older or less fit patients (this is more common) intensive – for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients) The medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy medicines kill the myeloma cells. The most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide. increased risk of infections feeling sick vomiting hair loss Steroids Steroid medications ( corticosteroids ) help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective. The 2 most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and prednisolone. Steroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. Possible side effects include heartburn , indigestion , increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep. Thalidomide Thalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. You take it as a tablet every day, usually in the evening as it can make you feel sleepy. Other common side effects include: constipation dizziness rashes numbness or tingling in the hands and feet ( peripheral neuropathy ) Thalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form of contraception such as a condom However, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a stem cell transplant will be needed to help your bone marrow recover. Additional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used again as your haematologist feels is appropriate. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. They’re both taken by mouth, and both can have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause: increased risk of infection – as a result of a low number of white blood cells anaemia – caused by a low number of red blood cells bruising and bleeding – because of a low platelet count They may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide. For example: painkillers – may be given to reduce pain radiotherapy – may be used to relieve bone pain or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired bisphosphonate medication – either given as tablets or by injection, this may help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood blood transfusions or erythropoietin medication – may be used to increase your red blood cell count and treat anaemia surgery – may be carried out to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back) dialysis – may be required if you develop kidney failure Clinical trials and research There will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It’s usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It’s estimated that up to 1 in every 3 people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. Early-stage NAFLD doesn’t usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis , if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes , heart attacks and strokes . If detected and managed at an early stage, it’s possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. Stages of NAFLD NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: simple fatty liver (steatosis) – a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)– a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population ","Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience: a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) fatigue (extreme tiredness) unexplained weight loss weakness Read more about the . How NAFLD is diagnosed NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don’t always pick up NAFLD. The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. If you’re diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue ( biopsy ) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory. ","cirrhosis – the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and liver cancer It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It’s important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse. Am I at risk of NAFLD? You’re at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: are obese or overweight – particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an ‘apple-like’ body shape) have type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure have high cholesterol are over the age of 50 smoke However, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. Although it’s very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) , NAFLD isn’t caused by drinking too much alcohol. ",,"Most people with NAFLD won’t develop any serious problems, but if you’re diagnosed with the condition it’s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems. Healthy diet and lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. The following can all help. Lose weight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it. Eat a healthy diet – try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too. Exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don’t lose weight. Stop smoking – if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes. NAFLD isn’t caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. It’s therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Medication There isn’t currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. For example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure , treat high cholesterol , treat type 2 diabetes and/or treat obesity . Liver transplant If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. For adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors. Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor’s liver are able to regrow to a normal size. Read more about liver transplants . ",
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/,About non-Hodgkin lymphoma ,". Who’s affected? Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected. The outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type, grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person’s age. The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Lymph nodes, also known as lymph glands, are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection. The swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell, known as lymphocytes, collecting in the lymph node. However, it’s highly unlikely you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes , as these glands often swell as a response to infection. night sweats unintentional weight loss a high temperature (fever) a persistent cough or feeling of breathlessness persistent itching of the skin all over the body abdominal pain or indigestion . A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to: persistent tiredness or fatigue an increased risk of infections excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds , heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin When to seek medical advice If necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected non-Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . In some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. For example, ‘E’ (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system. Grading non-Hodgkin lymphoma Testing can also help health professionals decide the ‘grade’ of the cancer. There are two main grades of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively Chemotherapy Chemotherapy If there’s a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine. Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: fatigue breathlessness increased vulnerability to infection bleeding and bruising more easily headaches , fever and chills tiredness nausea an itchy rash You may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab. a high temperature (fever) headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness a painful blistering rash Vaccination You should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up to date. Other health problems ","Diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you: have a medical condition that weakens your immune system take immunosuppressant medication glandular fever You also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition. Read more about the . How non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The exact reason why this happens isn’t known. The abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: bone marrow spleen liver skin lungs However, in some cases, non-Hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout the body). Who’s most at risk? While the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV glandular fever being previously exposed to the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) having a Helicobacter pylori infection – a common bacterial infection that usually infects the lining of the stomach and small intestine having received chemotherapy or radiotherapy for an earlier cancer having coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and isn’t thought to run in families, although your risk may be slightly increased if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but most cases are diagnosed in people over 65. The condition is slightly more common in men than women. Diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma ","biopsy . This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. Read more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Biopsy A biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory. Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and a general anaesthetic may be required (where you’re asleep). Further tests may include: blood tests bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic chest X-ray – this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs computerised tomography (CT) scan – this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer positron emission tomography (PET) scan depression . ","Complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma About non-Hodgkin lymphoma Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Read more about the There are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of 2 broad categories: high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively chemotherapy radiotherapy Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable.

Find out more about the register . having an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus or Sjogren’s syndrome Types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma extranodal marginal zone B-cell (MALT) mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma peripheral T-cell lymphoma skin (cutaneous) lymphomas anaplastic large-cell lymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more detailed information on the different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Further testing lumbar puncture – using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cells Stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma When the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. ‘Staging’ means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread. The main stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are. stage 1 – the cancer is limited to 1 group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs) stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm stage 4 – the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow In some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time. Read more about . In a few cases, if the initial cancer is very small and can be removed during a biopsy You can ask your care team if a clinical trial is available to take part in. Wait-and-see approach The medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer. Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility , which may be temporary or permanent Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is most often used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in 1 part of the body. Other common side effects include: tiredness nausea and vomiting dry mouth loss of appetite Read more about: side effects of radiotherapy complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma Monoclonal antibody therapy For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody. One of the main monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab. This medication is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours. Side effects of rituximab can include: flu Steroid medication Steroid medication is commonly used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective. The steroid medication is normally given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. A short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have. Common side effects of short-term steroid use include: increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain indigestion problems sleeping feeling agitated On rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. Side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids. Follow-up These appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.

Weakened immune system Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you’re being treated. If you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections, and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. Examples of ‘live’ vaccines include the: shingles vaccine BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) MMR vaccine (against measles , mumps and rubella) Infertility Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility . This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent. Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.

When to speak to your GP laryngitis , but it’s a good idea to get them checked out. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer. Read more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer . They may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings. If laryngeal cancer is suspected, you’ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that anyone aged 45 or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks. Nasendoscopy A nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx. During the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor. You’ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable. A local anaesthetic spray is sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don’t feel any pain. Laryngoscopy If it wasn’t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy. Like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail. A laryngoscopy can be very uncomfortable, so it’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you’ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after. Biopsy During a nasendoscopy or laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a biopsy . Alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration. Further testing If the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there’s a risk it may have spread, you’ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include: a computerised tomography (CT) scan – a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue a PET-CT scan – a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you’ve been injected with a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly an ultrasound scan – high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx Staging and grading After these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer. Healthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. the T stage is given as a number from 1 to 4 – small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4 the N stage is given as a number from 0 to 3 – N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected the M stage is given as either M0 or M1 – M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has There are also 3 different grades (1 to 3) used to describe laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread. Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3, grow quickly and are more likely to spread. You can read more about the stages and grades of laryngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. corticosteroids ). Recovering from laryngeal cancer If you’ve had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it’s likely that you’ll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you’ve recovered. You won’t be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people takes at least a week or two. While your throat heals, you’ll need to be fed through a tube that’s passed through your nose and into your stomach. If you’ve had all of your larynx removed (total laryngectomy), you won’t be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords. A number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take weeks or months to learn. Therefore, it’s likely that you’ll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper, during the first few weeks or months after surgery. This can be a frustrating experience – the loss of something you’ve previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with. Try to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways. Some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they’re deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak. Your emotions The emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. Many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect. For example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy. These emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings of depression . You may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing things you enjoy. Read more about stopping smoking . Cutting down on alcohol Staying within the recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption will also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal and liver cancers. Studies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5 to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20 to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol. ","Diagnosing laryngeal cancer smoking tobacco regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol having a family history of head and neck cancer having an unhealthy diet exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.

How laryngeal cancer is treated Laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it’s not clear exactly why this happens. All cancers begin with a change in a cell’s DNA. DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. It’s not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing. What can increase your risk? A number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer. Alcohol and tobacco Alcohol and tobacco are the 2 main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They’re thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx. The more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than people who don’t smoke. Compared to people who don’t drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about 3 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer. If you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition. Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer . Family history People who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history. Diet There’s evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. Having a ‘Mediterranean diet’ or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk. Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer . Human papilloma virus (HPV) Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix (neck of the womb), anus, mouth and throat. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer . It’s thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. HPV is often spread during sex, including oral sex. Exposure to harmful substances Having a job where you’re exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include: asbestos coal or wood dust paint or diesel fumes nickel sulphuric acid fumes formaldehyde (a chemical used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics) isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent) Diagnosing laryngeal cancer ",,"Recovering from laryngeal cancer Preventing laryngeal cancer About laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box). The larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). It plays an important role in helping you breathe and speak. The condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It’s about 4 times more common in men than women. radiotherapy , surgery and chemotherapy . Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it’s diagnosed early. If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used. This may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound. Read more about and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery . diagnosing laryngeal cancer for more information on staging). If you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or radiotherapy alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required. In later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed. A medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable. Radiotherapy As well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including: sore, red skin (similar to sunburn ) mouth ulcers dry mouth loss of taste loss of appetite tiredness feeling sick Your MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth. Radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing. Read more about radiotherapy . Surgery There are 3 types of surgery that can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are: endoscopic resection partial laryngectomy total laryngectomy Endoscopic resection Endoscopic resection can be used in early-stage laryngeal cancer. During the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments. An endoscopic resection is carried out under general anaesthetic , so you will be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain. Your mouth and throat may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there’s a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent. Partial laryngectomy A partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak. While your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon may need to create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy. Once your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar. This operation is uncommon nowadays, as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible. Total laryngectomy A total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them. As your vocal cords will be removed, you won’t be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech. If you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation. You will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months. See recovering from laryngeal cancer for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective. Chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as: feeling and being sick hair loss loss of appetite diarrhoea sore mouth and mouth ulcers tiredness Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness. Read more about chemotherapy . Cetuximab Cetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce. Cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it’s not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill. Cetuximab is given slowly through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It’s usually given weekly for up to 7 weeks. Side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include: rashes feeling sick diarrhoea breathlessness Cetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases, the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening. The National Association of Laryngectomee Clubs (NALC) is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. NALC is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy. Looking after your stoma If you’ve had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). During the first few months after surgery, it’s likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you’ve had radiotherapy . Excessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. Once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed. It’s important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection. A specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean. You’ll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs. It’s important to remember that you’ll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. This is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma. Speaking after surgery Voice prosthesis A voice prosthesis is an artificial valve implanted into your neck. When you want to speak, you cover the stoma and breathe out through the valve. The valve produces a noise, which you can use to make words by moving your lips and mouth in the usual way. The voice that’s produced by the valve sounds natural, although it may be lower-pitched than your previous voice. If you choose to have a voice prosthesis, it can be fitted during the surgery to remove your larynx. Oesophageal speech Oesophageal speech is a technique for speaking that your SLT can teach you. It involves learning to push air through your oesophagus (gullet). As the air moves through your oesophagus, it vibrates and makes a noise. You can produce words by moving your lips and mouth. Some people find it quite easy to learn oesophageal speech, whereas others find it difficult. Regular practice by yourself and with your SLT can help you improve. Electrolarynx An electrolarynx is a small, battery-operated electrical device that vibrates and produces sound. You hold the device under your chin, and as you move your mouth and lips the vibrations translate into spoken words. Your SLT can train you to use it correctly. Preventing laryngeal cancer It’s thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle. Avoiding tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition. Avoiding tobacco products Using tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer. Tobacco comes in many forms, including: cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars cigarillos snuff (powdered tobacco snorted through the nose) chewing tobacco If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. If you decide to stop smoking your free NHS stop smoking service can help you give up. You can also call Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 for free expert advice and support. Read more about and tips on cutting down how much you drink . Healthy diet Research shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil, may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. This type of diet is sometimes known as a ‘Mediterranean diet’. Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables each day may help to reduce your chances of developing many types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.

How is norovirus spread? Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch it if small particles of vomit or stools (poo) from an infected person get into your mouth through: close contact with someone with norovirus who may breathe out small particles of the virus that you then inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects, as the virus can survive outside the body for several days eating contaminated food, which can happen if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands before preparing or handling food You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing and your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Preventing norovirus It’s not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice can help stop the virus spreading. You should: avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before preparing or handling food be aware alcohol-based hand gels don’t kill the virus Maintain basic hygiene and cleaning to help stop the spread of norovirus by: disinfecting any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated, using a bleach-based household cleaner. washing any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash (60°C) to ensure the virus is killed. not sharing towels and flannels flushing any poo or vomit in the toilet and cleaning the surrounding area with a bleach-based household cleaner avoiding eating raw, unwashed food only eating oysters from a reliable source as they can carry norovirus What to do if you have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and/or vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. You can also: take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains get plenty of rest use special rehydration drinks, available from community pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration , such as a dry mouth or dark urine If you feel like eating, try plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.

During a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light. It can last from a few seconds to 15 minutes or more. How to stop a nosebleed To stop a nosebleed: Sit down at a table, lean forward and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Lean forward and breathe through your mouth. Spit out any blood that collects in your throat or mouth into a bowl. Do not swallow any blood.

Obesity,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/obesity/,About obesity ,,"Diagnosing obesity Obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity. The excess energy is stored by the body as fat. Obesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars. There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) , although these type of conditions don’t usually cause weight problems if they’re effectively controlled with medication. Read more about the high blood pressure high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke asthma metabolic syndrome – a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity several types of cancer , including bowel cancer, breast cancer and womb cancer gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet) gallstones – small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder reduced fertility osteoarthritis – a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints sleep apnoea liver disease and kidney disease pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy) Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is. It’s estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least 1 in every 13 deaths in Europe. Outlook There’s no “quick fix” for obesity. Weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. The healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved. Regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight can also help. Remember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease. Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. If you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don’t burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat. Calories The energy value of food is measured in units called calories. The average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day. This amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. For example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories – and that’s just one meal. Another problem is that many people aren’t physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat. Poor diet Obesity doesn’t happen overnight. It develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as: eating large amounts of processed or fast food – that’s high in fat and sugar drinking too much alcohol – alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight eating out a lot – you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar eating larger portions than you need – you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions drinking too many sugary drinks – including soft drinks and fruit juice comfort eating – if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel better Unhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. You may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you’re young and continue them into adulthood. Read more about eating well Lack of physical activity Lack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. They also rely on their cars, rather than walking or cycling . For relaxation, many people tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely take regular exercise . If you’re not active enough, you don’t use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat. The Department of Health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. This doesn’t need to be done all in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. For example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week. If you’re obese and trying to lose weight , you may need to do more exercise than this. It may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week. Read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults Genetics Some people claim there’s no point trying to lose weight because “it runs in my family” or “it’s in my genes”. While there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, there’s no reason why most people can’t lose weight. It may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents – such as having a large appetite – may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn’t make it impossible. In many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood. Medical reasons In some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. These include: an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones However, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss. Certain medicines, including some corticosteroids , medications for epilepsy and diabetes , and some medications used to treat mental illness – including antidepressants and medicines for schizophrenia – can contribute to weight gain. Weight gain can sometimes be a side effect of stopping smoking Diagnosing obesity Body mass index (BMI) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height. For most adults, having a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re considered to be a healthy weight. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese. While BMI is a useful measurement for most people, it’s not accurate for everyone. For example, the normal BMI scores may not be accurate if you’re very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in a high BMI when you’re not an unhealthy weight. In such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below). What’s considered a healthy BMI is also influenced by your ethnic background. The scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white Caucasian background. If you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower. BMI shouldn’t be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because their bodies are still developing. Speak to your GP if you want to find out whether your child is overweight. Visiting your GP If you’re overweight or obese, visit your GP for advice about losing weight safely and to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems. Your GP may ask about: your lifestyle – particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they’ll also ask you whether you smoke and how much alcohol you drink how you feel about being overweight – for example, if it makes you feel depressed how motivated you are to lose weight your family history – as obesity and other health conditions, such as diabetes , are often more common in families As well as calculating your BMI, your GP may also carry out tests to determine whether you’re at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight. These could include measuring your: blood pressure glucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample waist circumference (the distance around your waist) People with very large waists – generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women – are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems. Your GP may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. For example, some people of Asian, African or Afro-Caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) . Healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds. ",,"About obesity The term ‘obese’ describes a person who’s very overweight, with a lot of body fat. It’s a common problem in the UK that’s estimated to affect around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11. Defining obesity There are many ways in which a person’s health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of whether you’re a healthy weight for your height. You can use the BMI healthy weight chart to work out your score. For most adults, a BMI of: 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re a healthy weight 25 to 29.9 means you’re overweight 30 to 39.9 means you’re obese 40 or above means you’re severely obese BMI isn’t used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high BMI without excess fat. But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they’re a healthy weight, overweight or obese. A better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a BMI of 30 to 34.9). Generally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems. Read more about diagnosing obesity Risks of obesity It’s very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing obvious physical changes, it can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer stroke Obesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression and low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity). The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly . To do this you should: eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) join a local weight loss group take up activities such as fast walking , jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat You may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating. If lifestyle changes alone don’t help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you. In rare cases, weight loss surgery may be recommended. Read more about how obesity is treated Other obesity-related problems Obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions. Day-to-day problems related to obesity include: breathlessness increased sweating snoring difficulty doing physical activity often feeling very tired joint and back pain low confidence and self-esteem feeling isolated The psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression. Serious health conditions Being obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including: If you’re obese, speak to your GP for advice about losing weight safely. Your GP can advise you about losing weight safely by eating a healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity . They can also let you know about other useful services, such as: local weight loss groups – these could be provided by your local authority, the NHS, or commercial services you may have to pay for exercise on prescription – where you’re referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainer If you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), high blood pressure , diabetes or obstructive sleep apnoea Read more about how your GP can help you lose weight Diet There’s no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg (1lb to 2lbs) a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day. For most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day. The best way to achieve this is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices. A healthy diet should consist of: plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties) some milk and dairy foods some meat, fish, aggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in fat and suagr Try to avoid foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous for people who are already obese. You’ll also need to check calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don’t go over your daily limit. Some restaurants, cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn’t compulsory. Be careful when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or Chinese dishes. Diet programmes and fad diets Avoid fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. These types of diets don’t work, can make you feel ill, and aren’t sustainable because they don’t teach you long-term healthy eating habits. This isn’t to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. Many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people. A responsible diet programme should: educate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes and healthy eating not be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat be based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to last Very low calorie diets A very low calorie diet (VLCD) is where you consume less than 800 calories a day. These diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but they aren’t a suitable or safe method for everyone, and they aren’t routinely recommended for managing obesity. VLCDs are usually only recommended if you have an obesity-related complication that would benefit from rapid weight loss. VLCDs shouldn’t usually be followed for longer than 12 weeks at a time, and they should only be used under the supervision of a suitably qualified healthcare professional. Speak to your GP first if you’re considering this type of diet. Exercise Reducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy. As well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. For example, it can help prevent and manage more than 20 conditions, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40%. The Chief Medical Officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week – for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. Something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial. Moderate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as: brisk walking cycling recreational swimming dancing Alternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. During vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. Examples include: running most competitive sports circuit training You should also do strength and balance training two days a week. This could be in the form of a gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such as tai chi . It’s also critical that you break up sitting (sedentary) time by getting up and moving around. Read more about strength and balance exercises . Your GP, weight loss adviser or staff at your local sports centre can help you create a plan suited to your own personal needs and circumstances, with achievable and motivating goals. Start small and build up gradually. It’s also important to find activities you enjoy and want to keep doing. Activities with a social element or exercising with friends or family can help keep you motivated. Make a start today – it’s never too late. Read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults and the physical activity guidelines for older adults . Other useful strategies Evidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. This could include things like: setting realistic weight loss goals – if you’re obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications eating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you’re eating – for example, not being distracted by watching TV avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat involving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts –they can help to motivate you monitoring your progress – for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diary Getting psychological support from a trained healthcare professional may also help you change the way you think about food and eating. Techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be useful. Avoiding weight regain It’s important to remember that as you lose weight your body needs less food (calories), so after a few months, weight loss slows and levels off, even if you continue to follow a diet. If you go back to your previous calorie intake once you’ve lost weight, it’s very likely you’ll put the weight back on. Increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes a day and continuing to watch what you eat may help you keep the weight off. Medication Many different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat. You can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it’s the right medicine for you. In most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. Only one product (Alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist. Orlistat works by preventing around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. The undigested fat isn’t absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). This will help you avoid gaining weight, but won’t necessarily cause you to lose weight. When orlistat should be used Orlistat will usually only be recommended if you’ve made a significant effort to lose weight through diet, exercise or changing your lifestyle. Even then, orlistat is only prescribed if you have a: body mass index (BMI) of 28 or more, and other weight-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes BMI of 30 or more Before prescribing orlistat, your doctor will discuss the benefits and potential limitations with you, including any potential side effects (see below). If you’re prescribed orlistat, you’ll also be offered advice and support about diet, exercise and making lifestyle changes. Orlistat isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. One orlistat capsule is taken with water immediately before, during or up to one hour after, each main meal (up to a maximum of three capsules a day). If you miss a meal, or the meal doesn’t contain any fat, you shouldn’t need to take the orlistat capsule. Your doctor should explain this to you, or you can check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Taking orlistat with other health conditions If you have type 2 diabetes, it may take you longer to lose weight using orlistat, so your target weight loss after three months may therefore be slightly lower. If orlistat has helped you lose weight after three months, your prescription may be continued for up to a year. After that, your GP will carry out a review and decide whether you should continue taking it. Side effects Common side effects of orlistat include: fatty or oily stools needing the toilet urgently passing stools more frequently an oily discharge from your rectum (you may have oily spots on your underwear) flatulence (wind) stomach pain headaches upper respiratory tract infections, such as a cold These side effects are much less likely to occur if you stick to a low-fat diet. Women taking the oral contraceptive pill should use an additional method of contraception , such as a condom , if they experience severe diarrhoea while taking orlistat. This is because the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed by your body if you have diarrhoea, so it may not be effective. Surgery Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese. Bariatric surgery is usually only available on the NHS to treat people with severe obesity who fulfil all of the following criteria: they have a BMI of 40 or more, or between 35 and 40 and another serious health condition that could be improved with weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure all appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried, but the person hasn’t achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss the person is fit enough to have anaesthesia and surgery the person commits to the need for long-term follow-up The amount of calories your child should eat each day will depend on their age and height. Your GP should be able to advise you about a recommended daily limit, and they may also be able to refer you to your local family healthy lifestyle programme. Children over the age of five should ideally get at least one hour (60 minutes) of vigorous-intensity exercise a day, such as running or playing football or netball. Sedentary activities, such as watching television and playing computer games, should be restricted. Read more about the physical activity guidelines for children and young people The use of orlistat in children is only recommended in exceptional circumstances, such as if a child is severely obese and has an obesity-related complication. Bariatric surgery isn’t generally recommended for children, but may be considered for young people in exceptional circumstances, and if they’ve achieved, or nearly achieved, physiological maturity.

Myasthenia gravis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/myasthenia-gravis/,,"Eyes You might experience droopy eyelids affecting one or both eyes, and double vision. In some people, only the eye muscles are affected (ocular myasthenia). Swallowing, speaking and breathing You might experience: slurred speech difficulty swallowing difficulty making facial expressions like smiling problems with chewing a change in your voice choking or accidentally inhaling food which can cause chest infections shortness of breath Limbs and neck The muscle weakness might spread to other parts of the body like your arms, legs and neck. You might experience: weakness in your arms, legs, neck or other parts of your body difficulty holding your head up aching muscles problems with tasks like climbing stairs or washing your hair Myasthenic crisis Blood test A blood test will look for a high level of antibodies (made by your immune system) which might be causing myasthenia gravis. Electromyography You might have electromyography (an EMG) to test your nerves and muscles. During electromyography, you’ll have small needles inserted into your muscles to measure their electric activity. These are usually inserted around your eyes, forehead or arms. The test will measure the signals from the nerves to the muscles. If the test detects a disruption in the signals, this might be a sign of myasthenia gravis. Scans You might have a computerised tomography (CT) scan to check if the thymus gland in your chest is bigger than expected or has grown abnormally (a thymoma). The thymus gland is part of your immune system. Problems with the thymus gland like inflammation (swelling), can be linked to myasthenia gravis. An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Triggers might include: stress tiredness infections medicines surgery Using steroids long term can cause side effects including osteoporosis (weak bones) , weight gain, infection and diabetes . Read more about the side effects of steroids Immunosuppressants Immunosuppressants work by reducing the activity of your immune system. Your healthcare team might suggest taking immunosuppressants if: Commonly used immunosuppressants include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate. You’ll need to take the tablets every day and it can take at least 9 months to feel the full effect. You’ll be advised to take steroids at first. Immunosuppressants night cause side effects like: loss of appetite and tiredness feeling sick increased risk of infections You’ll have regular blood tests to check the the medicine isn’t causing any harm. Surgery Your healthcare team might recommend surgery to remove the thymus gland (thymectomy). Surgery can reduce: the dose of steroids the need to take other immunosuppressants Your thymectomy will usually be carried out through keyhole surgery. The thymus is removed using surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the chest. Plasma exchange and IVIG Plasma exchange and IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) can offer a quick improvement (within a few days) for people with myasthenia gravis who are particularly unwell or are having a myasthenic crisis. You might find that, during pregnancy or after having a baby, your myasthenia gravis worsens. If you’re planning a pregnancy or become pregnant, you should speak to your healthcare team. Don’t stop taking your medications without first speaking to your healthcare professional. ","It’s a rare condition that commonly affects the muscles that control the eyes and eyelids. It can also affect the face, speaking, chewing, swallowing and other parts of the body. It can affect people at any age, but is most often found in women under 40 and men over 60. There are other rarer types of myasthenia which you can read about on myaware . If you drive, you must inform the DVLA that you have myasthenia gravis. ",,"It’s possible for patients to experience a myasthenic crisis before they know they have myasthenia gravis. Phone 999 for an ambulance if: you’re experiencing severe breathing or swallowing problems You should avoid activities that could become dangerous if you experience sudden weakness, like swimming alone. Diagnosing myasthenia gravis Medicine Pyridostigmine Sometimes myasthenia gravis can be treated with pyridostigmine alone. It works by temporarily improving the nerve to muscle transmission to help muscle strength. It can reduce muscle weakness and for some people this is the only medication they need to control the condition. It’s effects do not last long and it needs to be taken periodically throughout the day to give the best results. Side effects can include stomach upset, diarrhoea and drooling. Steroids You might be advised to take steroid tablets like prednisolone if pyridostigmine isn’t helping. Steroid tablets work by reducing the activity of your immune system to stop it attacking the communication between your nerves and muscles. ",
Osteoporosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/osteoporosis/,About osteoporosis ,,"The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures hip fractures fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae) However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis isn’t usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain. Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Who’s affected? Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK. Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45). Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids other medical conditions – such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis – particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels having a low body mass index (BMI) heavy drinking and smoking Read more about the . Diagnosing osteoporosis Risk assessment tools If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such as FRAX or Q-Fracture. These tools help to predict a person’s risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm. DEXA scan They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It’s a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. Your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who’s the same age and sex as you. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score. Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: above -1 SD is normal between -1 and -2.5 SD is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis Osteopenia You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis. Bones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. You gradually start losing bone density from around the age of 35. This happens to everyone, but some people develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. This means they’re at greater risk of a fracture. Risk groups Osteoporosis can affect men and women. It’s more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people. Women Women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density. The female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the menopause (when monthly periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. This can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density. Women are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have: an early menopause (before the age of 45) a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed absent periods for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dieting Men In most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there’s a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy. Men continue producing testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone. the use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids alcohol misuse Risk factors Many hormones in the body can affect the process of bone turnover. If you have a condition of the hormone-producing glands, you may have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Hormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include: hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) disorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing’s syndrome reduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone) disorders of the pituitary gland hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands) Other risk factors Other factors thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include: a family history of osteoporosis a parental history of hip fracture a body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids (widely used for conditions such as arthritis and asthma ), which can affect bone strength having an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia heavy drinking and smoking rheumatoid arthritis malabsorption problems, as experienced in coeliac disease and Crohn’s disease some medications used to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer which affect hormone levels long periods of inactivity, such as long-term bed rest You can read more about who’s at risk of osteoporosis and broken bones on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website . This can be painful when it occurs, but it may also lead to long-term (chronic) pain. Your GP or nurse may be able to help with this. During the healing process, you may need the help of a physiotherapist or occupational therapist so you can make as full a recovery as possible. Read more about occupational therapy . Coping with pain Everyone experiences pain differently, so what works for you may differ from what works for someone else. There are different ways to manage pain, including: medication ",age sex risk of fracture previous injury history ,"Preventing osteoporosis Living with osteoporosis About osteoporosis Read more about how osteoporosis is treated . Preventing osteoporosis If you’re at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy.

Living with osteoporosis If you’re diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests. To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain relaxation techniques Speak to your GP or nurse if you’re worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition. The Royal Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with local support groups . Read more about living with osteoporosis . You may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. However, you should ensure you’re maintaining sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D. To achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements. NICE recommendations The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made some recommendations about who should be treated with medication for osteoporosis. A number of factors are taken into consideration before deciding which medication to use. These include your: age bone mineral density (measured by your T score) risk factors for fracture NICE has summarised its guidance for two groups of people: Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture. There are a number of different bisphosphonates, including alendronate etidronate ibandronate risedronate zolendronic acid They’re given as a tablet or injection. You should always take bisphosphonates on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. Stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. You’ll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids. Bisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them for five years or longer. You may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate. The main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include: irritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach) swallowing problems (dysphagia) stomach pain Not everyone will experience these side effects. cancer and not for osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate Strontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells that break down bone and the cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). The main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea and diarrhoea Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) SERMs are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. They help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine. Side effects associated with raloxifene include: hot flushes leg cramps a potential increased risk of blood clots Parathyroid hormone (teriparatide) Parathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body. It regulates the amount of calcium in bone. Calcium and vitamin D supplements Calcium is the major mineral found in bone, and having enough calcium as part of a healthy, balanced diet is important for maintaining healthy bones. For most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day, which most people should be able to get from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium. However, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. Ask your GP for advice about taking calcium supplements. Vitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium. It’s difficult to get enough vitamin D from your diet alone because few foods contain vitamin D. In the UK, most healthy adults obtain vitamin D from exposing the skin to summer sunlight. However, for people at risk of not getting enough vitamin D, supplementation with 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day (400 international units [IU]) is recommended to prevent deficiency. At-risk groups include people over 65 years of age, and people who aren’t exposed to much sunlight because they cover their skin for cultural reasons, are housebound, or who stay indoors for long periods. If you’re found to lack vitamin D, your GP may prescribe supplements at a higher dose than the above recommendation to correct the deficiency. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) HRT is sometimes recommended for women who are experiencing the menopause This is because HRT slightly increases the risk of developing certain conditions, such as breast cancer , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , stroke and venous thromboembolism more than it lowers the risk of osteoporosis. Discuss the benefits and risks of HRT with your GP. Read more about the risks of HRT . Preventing osteoporosis Your genes are responsible for determining your height and the strength of your skeleton, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise influence how healthy your bones are. Regular exercise Regular exercise is essential. Adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking , every week. Weight-bearing exercise and resistance exercise are particularly important for improving bone density and helping to prevent osteoporosis. As well as aerobic exercise, adults aged 19 to 64 should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week by working all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, arms and shoulders. If you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it’s a good idea to talk to your GP or health specialist before starting a new exercise programme to make sure it’s right for you. Read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults . Weight-bearing exercises Weight-bearing exercises are exercises where your feet and legs support your weight. High-impact weight-bearing exercises, such as running , skipping, dancing, aerobics, and even jumping up and down on the spot, are all useful ways to strengthen your muscles, ligaments and joints. When exercising, wear footwear that provides your ankles and feet with adequate support, such as trainers or walking boots. People over the age of 60 can also benefit from regular weight-bearing exercise. This can include brisk walking, keep-fit classes or a game of tennis. Swimming and cycling aren’t weight-bearing exercises, however. Read more about physical activity guidelines for older adults . Resistance exercises Resistance exercises use muscle strength, where the action of the tendons pulling on the bones boosts bone strength. Examples include press-ups, weightlifting or using weight equipment at a gym. If you’ve recently joined a gym or haven’t been for a while, your gym will probably offer you an induction. This involves being shown how to use the equipment and having exercise techniques recommended to you. Always ask an instructor for help if you’re not sure how to use a piece of gym equipment or how to do a particular exercise. Healthy eating Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended for everyone. It can help prevent many serious health conditions, including heart disease , diabetes and many forms of cancer , as well as osteoporosis. Calcium is important for maintaining strong bones. Adults need 700mg a day, which you should be able to get from your daily diet. Calcium-rich foods include: leafy green vegetables dried fruit tofu yoghurt Vitamin D is also important for healthy bones and teeth because it helps your body absorb calcium. Vitamin D can be found in: eggs milk oily fish However, most vitamin D is made in the skin in response to sunlight. Short exposure to sunlight without wearing sunscreen (10 minutes twice a day) throughout the summer should provide you with enough vitamin D for the whole year. Certain groups of people may be at risk of not getting enough vitamin D. These include: people who are housebound or particularly frail people with a poor diet people who keep covered up in sunlight because they wear total sun block or adhere to a certain dress code women who are pregnant or breastfeeding If you’re at risk of not getting enough vitamin D through your diet or lifestyle, you can take a vitamin D supplement. For adults, 10 micrograms a day of vitamin D is recommended. The recommended amount for children is 7 micrograms for babies under six months, and 8.5 micrograms for children aged six months to three years. Talk to your GP for more information. Read more about healthy eating . Other factors Other lifestyle factors that can help prevent osteoporosis include: quitting smoking – smoking is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis limiting your alcohol intake – the NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; it’s also important to avoid binge drinking Read more about healthy bones on the National Osteoporosis Society website. Living with osteoporosis Getting support Your GP or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about living with osteoporosis and can reassure you if you’re worried. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information about these. Some people find it helpful to talk to others with osteoporosis, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room. Osteoporosis support The Royal Osteoporosis Society provides a helpline service run by nurses with specialist knowledge of osteoporosis and bone health. Call 0808 800 0035. You can also email them at nurses@theros.org.uk They can provide you with details of local support groups . Recovering from a broken bone Broken bones usually take six to eight weeks to recover. Having osteoporosis doesn’t affect how long this takes. Recovery depends on the type of fracture you have. Some fractures heal easily, while others may need more intervention. If you have a complicated wrist fracture or hip fracture, you may need an operation to make sure the bone is set properly. Hip replacements are often needed after hip fractures, and some people may lose mobility as a result of weakened bones. transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – this is thought to reduce pain by stimulating the nerves simple relaxation techniques , massage or hypnosis You can use more than one of these techniques at the same time to manage your pain – for example, you could combine medication, a heat pack and relaxation techniques. Working and money You should be able to continue working if you have osteoporosis. It’s very important that you remain physically active and have a fulfilled lifestyle. This will help keep your bones healthy and stop you focusing too much on your potential health problems. However, if your work involves the risk of falling or breaking a bone, seek advice from your employer, GP and the Royal Osteoporosis Society about how to limit your risk of having an accident or injury that could lead to a bone break. If you can’t continue working, you may be eligible for the Personal Independence Payment . People over 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a disability benefit called Attendance Allowance . Help for carers You may also be entitled to certain benefits if you care for someone with osteoporosis. Read more about benefits for carers .

Osteosarcoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/osteosarcoma/,Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. Osteosarcomas occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under 5. ,"Pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis. How osteosarcoma is diagnosed Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests. The doctor at the hospital will take your child’s full medical history. They will then do a physical examination. This will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. Your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health. A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose osteosarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see. A small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It’s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic. Other tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. These include a chest X-ray , blood tests , a bone scan and an MRI or CT scan . Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. Grading Grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. Low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread. In high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread. Most osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade. Staging ","retinoblastoma (a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour. Chemotherapy side effects Some general side effects of chemotherapy can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoea Radiotherapy side effects Radiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. Surgery side effects If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having. Late side effects A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects. Clinical trials ",,"Osteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. Any bone in the body can be affected. The most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints. There are several different types of osteosarcoma. Most occur in the centre of the bone. There are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma. Most patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease). A staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below: Stage 1A The cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone. Stage 1B The cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Stage 2A The cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone. Stage 2B The cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Most osteosarcomas are stage 2B. Stage 3 The cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Radiotherapy Radiotherapy may occasionally be given. This treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Surgery The type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. This surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one. Surgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery. Amputation Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs can work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports. Limb-sparing surgery There are 2 ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done: replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part) replacing the affected bone with bone taken from another part of the body (bone graft) After this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. However, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. This is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. This may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Your child’s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Many children with osteosarcoma are cured. However, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. Your child will have regular check-ups and X-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre. ",
Ovarian cancer: Teenagers and young adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-teenagers-and-young-adults/ovarian-cancer-teenagers-and-young-adults/,Introduction Germ cell tumours of the ovary Having tests for ovarian cancer ,"having tests for ovarian cancer pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen) a feeling of fullness or bloating in your tummy needing to pee more often irregular periods If you’re worried about ovarian cancer tests to find out more. We have more information for young people about: having tests for ovarian cancer Tests These might include: a blood test an ultrasound of the ovaries an internal examination, to check the organs in your pelvis For an internal examination, you lie on your back with your feet together and your knees apart. The doctor will gently put 1 or 2 fingers inside your vagina and press a little on your lower tummy. It shouldn’t be painful but it can feel uncomfortable. This test might make you feel embarrassed, but doctors are used to doing this investigation and it’s over quickly. If a male doctor examines you, there will usually be a female nurse present, but if not you can ask for one. You can have someone you feel close to with you during the examination, or if you prefer you can ask whoever is with you to go out until it’s over. You can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. After these tests, your GP may arrange for you to see a doctor at the hospital who specialises in problems of the reproductive system (a gynaecologist). At the hospital The specialist will carry out an internal examination to check if there’s anything unusual in the shape and position of your ovaries and womb. Your GP may have already done an internal examination. More tests The specialist will arrange for you to have some more tests. Different tests are used to diagnose germ cell tumours of the ovary. Blood tests check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers. Some germ cell tumours produce high levels of these. Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build up a picture of your ovaries and the area around them on a computer screen. The person doing the scan will rub some gel on your tummy and gently move a small device over your tummy to produce the picture. You may also have an ultrasound scan done through the vagina (transvaginal ultrasound), to get a clearer picture. A small probe about the size of a tampon is gently put inside your vagina. It’s not painful but it can be a bit uncomfortable. You can have someone with you during the test if you want to. CT scans take a series of X-rays, which build up a 3D picture of the area of the body being scanned. It can show up the size and position of a tumour. Laparoscopy is a test that’s sometimes done to look inside your tummy at your ovaries. It’s done under a general anaesthetic. You can usually go home the same day. The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in the skin in your lower tummy (just above the bikini line). Then they put a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end (called a laparoscope) through one of the cuts to look at the ovaries. Sometimes the surgeon will remove the ovary at the same time as the laparoscopy but they will discuss this with you before you have the surgery. The removed ovary will be looked at under a microscope to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help. We’ve got more information for young people about: having tests for ovarian cancer If you’re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general ovarian cancer information. ",,,"Introduction This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. We have more info for young people about: For more information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general ovarian cancer section. Ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby. Your reproductive system Your reproductive system is made up of the: vagina – the passage from the cervix to outside your body cervix – the opening from the womb to the vagina womb (also called uterus) – where a baby grows during pregnancy fallopian tubes – which connect your ovaries to the womb ovaries – which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty Facts about ovaries You have 2 ovaries – 1 on each side of your womb. They’re about 4cm long. At puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start. Every month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb’s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man’s sperm. If this doesn’t happen, the womb’s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. This is a period. When a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause. Types of ovarian cancer There are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours. Teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called: dysgerminoma teratoma yolk sac tumour Your specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have. If you have a type of ovarian cancer or germ cell tumour that’s not listed here, you can talk to one of Macmillan’s cancer support specialists to find out more. Germ cell tumours of the ovary This section is for teenagers and young adults. Germ cell tumours of the ovary are the most common type of ovarian cancer in teenagers and young women. If you have a different type of ovarian cancer and want to know more you can talk to Macmillan Cancer Support . Germ cell tumours are a rare type of ovarian cancer. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary in girls and young women (aged 10 to 30). Tumours are often only in 1 ovary. They can usually be successfully treated, even if they’ve spread to other places in the body. Germ cell tumours can also develop in teenage boys’ or men’s testicles, or rarely in other parts of the body. This page is about germ cell tumours that start in the ovary, but we have more information about testicular cancer . If you’re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general ovarian cancer section. Having tests for ovarian cancer There are some tests that you might have at your doctor’s or at the hospital, to help them see if you have ovarian cancer. Visiting your GP If you think you might have any living with and after ovarian cancer If you’re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our ovarian cancer section. Most girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary. Surgery You may have an operation Having the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won’t stop you from having a baby in the future. You can still get pregnant with only 1 ovary. Before surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic. During the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. The ovary is removed through this cut. The operation is called a laparotomy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is given after your operation to: get rid of any cancer cells that weren’t removed with surgery stop the cancer from coming back Germ cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. When these are given together it’s called BEP for short. Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more. hair loss tiredness feeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine) being more at risk of getting an infection fertility in young women . Surgery and chemotherapy You’ll usually have chemotherapy after your surgery. You might have more surgery after you’ve finished chemotherapy if there’s still some tumour left behind. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Some types of germ cell tumour are sensitive to radiotherapy, but it is rarely used.

Read about how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed Read more about how oesophageal cancer is treated and living with oesophageal cancer Difficulty swallowing Difficulty swallowing is the most common symptom of oesophageal cancer. The cancer can narrow the oesophagus, making it difficult for food to pass down. It may feel as though food is getting stuck and sometimes swallowing may be uncomfortable or painful. You may have to chew your food more thoroughly, or you can only eat soft foods. If the tumour continues to grow, even liquids may become difficult to swallow. persistent indigestion or heartburn bringing up food soon after eating loss of appetite and weight loss persistent vomiting pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back a persistent cough hoarseness tiredness, shortness of breath and pale skin vomiting blood or coughing up blood – although this is uncommon When to get medical advice Speak to your GP if you experience: swallowing difficulties heartburn on most days for three weeks or more Read about how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed . They will carry out an initial assessment and decide whether you need to have any further tests. Seeing your GP Your GP may: carry out a physical examination take a look at your medical history If your GP thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist. This will usually be a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions affecting the digestive system). Tests to diagnose oesophageal cancer The 2 main tests used to diagnose oesophageal cancer are: an endoscopy – this is the most common test a barium swallow or barium meal Endoscopy An endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to see inside your oesophagus so they can check for cancer. A thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end (an endoscope) is passed into your mouth and down towards your stomach. Small samples of tissue are also removed from your oesophagus so they can be checked for cancer under a microscope. This is called a biopsy . You’ll be awake while an endoscopy is carried out. It shouldn’t be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable. You’ll normally be given local anaesthetic to numb your throat and possibly a sedative to help you relax. Barium swallow or barium meal A barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before several X-rays are taken. The barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the X-ray. This can show whether there’s anything blocking your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer. Surgery There are 3 main types of surgery for oesophageal cancer. Oesophagectomy Radiotherapy is most often given using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at your oesophagus, or sometimes by temporarily placing a small piece of radioactive material in your oesophagus (brachytherapy). Side effects Common side effects of radiotherapy include: tiredness temporary soreness when swallowing temporary worsening of swallowing difficulties a dry throat feeling or being sick ","Diagnosing oesophageal cancer The exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but the following things can increase your risk: persistent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) smoking drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time being overweight or obese having an unhealthy diet that’s low in fruit and vegetables Stopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, losing weight and having a healthy diet may help reduce your risk of developing oesophageal cancer. Read more about the The exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase the risk of it developing. GORD and Barrett’s oesophagus Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a condition in which a weakness in the muscles above the stomach means stomach acid can travel up into the oesophagus. In around 1 in 10 people with GORD, repeated damage from stomach acid over many years can eventually cause changes in the cells lining the oesophagus. This is called Barrett’s oesophagus. These abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in the future, although the risk is still small. It’s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop cancer within 10 to 20 years. Alcohol If the cells in the lining of your gullet become inflamed, they’re more likely to become cancerous. Read more about alcohol and drinking , including tips on cutting down Smoking Tobacco smoke contains many harmful toxins and chemicals. These substances irritate the cells that make up the lining of the oesophagus, which increases the likelihood that they will become cancerous. The longer you smoke, the greater your risk of developing oesophageal cancer. Read more about getting help to stop smoking Obesity If you’re overweight or obese , your risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus is higher than people of a healthy weight. The more overweight you are, the higher the risk. This may be partly because obese people are more at risk of developing GORD and Barrett’s oesophagus (see above). Read more information and advice about losing weight Diet Not eating enough fruit and vegetables may increase your risk of getting oesophageal cancer. You should aim to eat at least 5 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Read more about having a healthy diet Other medical conditions Certain rare medical conditions can also increase your chances of developing cancer of the oesophagus, including: achalasia – where the oesophagus loses the ability to move food along, causing vomiting and acid reflux Paterson-Brown Kelly syndrome (also called Plummer Vinson syndrome) – a condition that can cause iron deficiency anaemia and small growths in the throat tylosis – an inherited skin condition Diagnosing oesophageal cancer Speak to your GP if you experience ","Further tests If you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will be recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread – known as called the ‘stage’. These tests may include: a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken and put together by a computer to create a detailed picture of the inside of your body an endoscopic ultrasound scan – where a small probe that produces sound waves is passed down your throat to create an image of your oesophagus and the surrounding area a positron emission tomography (PET) scan – a scan that can help show how far the cancer has spread a laparoscopy – a type of keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep), in which a thin tube with a camera at the end is inserted through a cut in your skin to examine the area around your oesophagus Stages of oesophageal cancer The most widely used system for staging oesophageal cancer is the TNM system. This involves scoring the cancer in 3 categories: T (tumour) – the location and size of the tumour N (node) – whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body) M (metastasis) – whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones Scores for each category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer). talk to your friends and family – be open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put you and them at ease communicate with others in the same situation – you may want to contact a local support group or join a forum such as the HealthUnlocked forum for oesophageal patients or Cancer Chat find out more about your condition – check websites such as Cancer Research UK or Macmillan , or speak to your care team or GP if you have any questions about your condition take time out for yourself – don’t feel shy about telling friends and family if you want some time to yourself Read further information: Cancer Research UK: coping with oesophageal cancer Macmillan: coping with oesophageal cancer Work ","Living with oesophageal cancer About oesophageal cancer Oesophageal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the oesophagus (gullet) – the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s and is more common in men than women. If oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it may be possible to cure it with: surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus chemotherapy , with or without radiotherapy (chemoradiation), to kill the cancerous cells and shrink the tumour If oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at a later stage, a cure may not be achievable. Read more about Read further information: Cancer Research UK: diagnosing oesophageal cancer Cancer Research UK: stages and grades of oesophageal cancer Macmillan: how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed Macmillan: staging oesophageal cancer Your plan will largely depend on how far your cancer has spread – known as the ‘stage’. stage 1 to 3 oesophageal cancer is usually treated with surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus (oesophagectomy) – chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy may be given before surgery to make it more effective or is sometimes used instead of surgery During the procedure, your surgeon will remove the section of your oesophagus that contains the tumour and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes. A small portion of your stomach may also need to be removed. The remaining section of your oesophagus is then reconnected to your stomach. To access your oesophagus, your surgeon will either make incisions (cuts) in your tummy and chest, or in your tummy and neck. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) A procedure called endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) may sometimes be an option instead of an oesophagectomy if oesophageal cancer is diagnosed very early on. It involves cutting out the tumour using a loop of wire at the end of a thin flexible tube (endoscope). The endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin. Sometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or RFA). Stents For more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties, a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended. The stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy involves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying. It may be used: before and sometimes after surgery, either with or without radiotherapy – to shrink the cancer and reduce the risk of it coming back instead of surgery – in combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation) Side effects Common side effects of chemotherapy include: feeling sick loss of appetite losing weight diarrhoea feeling very tired increased risk of infections bleeding and bruising easily Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy Radiotherapy Radiotherapy involves using radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours. It may be used: in combination with chemotherapy before surgery – to shrink the cancer and reduce the risk of it coming back instead of surgery – usually in combination with chemotherapy (called chemoradiation) Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Macmillan: Living with oesophageal cancer Having oesophageal cancer can have a big impact on your life, but support is available to help you cope. Eating and swallowing chemotherapy and radiotherapy – although they may not work immediately. You might need to have a temporary feeding tube placed or fluids given through a drip inserted in a vein to begin with, before moving onto fluids by mouth and soft foods. You may eventually be able to eat solid food. A speech and language therapist can assess your ability to swallow and suggest ways to overcome any problems. A dietitian can also help with any changes you need to make to your diet.

Obstructive sleep apnoea,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/obstructive-sleep-apnoea/,About obstructive sleep apnoea Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea ,"Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include: loud snoring noisy and laboured breathing repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate. During an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep – either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness – so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally. These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired during the day. You’ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem. When to seek medical advice See your GP if you think you might have OSA. As someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed. Read more about diagnosing OSA . If OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others. Poorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of: developing high blood pressure (hypertension) having a stroke or heart attack developing an irregular heartbeat – such as atrial fibrillation developing type 2 diabetes – although it’s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity Research has shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident. If you’re diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. It’s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. The GOV.UK website has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition . Preventing OSA It’s not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes may reduce your risk of developing the condition. These include: losing weight if you’re overweight or obese limiting how much alcohol you drink and avoiding alcohol in the evening stopping smoking if you smoke avoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisers Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can usually be diagnosed after you’ve been observed sleeping at a sleep clinic, or by using a testing device worn overnight at home. Your blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample probably sent off to help rule out other conditions that could explain your tiredness, such as an underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ). The next step is to observe you while you’re asleep at a local sleep centre. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help treat people with sleep disorders. The Sleep Apnoea Trust Association has a list of NHS sleep clinics in Scotland . Observing your sleep This may include measuring your height and weight to work out your body mass index (BMI) , as well as measuring your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA. The sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight, either by spending the night at the clinic or taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse. Testing at home In many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home. The equipment you are given may include: a breathing sensor sensors to monitor your heart rate bands that are placed around your chest oxygen sensors that are put on your finger The equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate and snoring through the night. If more information about sleep quality is required, a more detailed investigation called polysomnography will be required, which will be carried out at the sleep centre. Testing at a sleep centre The main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography. During the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep. Bands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger. A number of different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including: electroencephalography (EEG) – this monitors brain waves electromyography (EMG) – this monitors muscle tone recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels electrocardiography (ECG) – this monitors your heart Sound recording and video equipment may also be used. Although it’s less clear whether stopping smoking can improve the condition, you’ll probably be advised to stop for general health reasons. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) As well as the lifestyle changes mentioned above, people with moderate to severe OSA usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. This is a small pump that delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask that either covers your nose or your nose and mouth. The compressed air prevents your throat closing. high blood pressure . Possible side effects of using a CPAP device can include: mask discomfort nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation difficulty breathing through your nose headaches and ear pain stomach pain and flatulence (wind) Earlier versions of CPAP also often caused problems such as nasal dryness and a sore throat. However, modern versions tend to include humidifiers, a device that increases moisture, which helps reduce these side effects. ","It’s normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn’t cause breathing problems. In people with OSA the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including: being overweight – excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make OSA worse being male – it’s not known why OSA is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution being 40 years of age or more – although OSA can occur at any age, it’s more common in people who are over 40 having a large neck – men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing OSA taking medicines with a sedative effect – such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers having an unusual inner neck structure – such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids or tongue, or a small lower jaw alcohol – drinking alcohol, particularly before going to sleep, can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse smoking – you’re more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke the menopause (in women) – the changes in hormone levels during the menopause may cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual having a family history of OSA – there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to OSA nasal congestion – OSA occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be a result of the airways being narrowed Mandibular advancement device (MAD) A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, similar to a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA. They’re not generally recommended for more severe OSA, although they may be an option if you’re unable to tolerate using a CPAP device. ",,"About obstructive sleep apnoea Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. This may lead to regularly interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions. Apnoea and hypopnoea There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA: apnoea – where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it’s called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more hypopnoea – a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases. As many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS. The term ‘obstructive’ distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending signals to the breathing muscles during sleep. lifestyle changes – such as losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device – these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask wearing a mandibular advancement device (MAD) – this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure. Read more about . Complications of OSA Before seeing your GP it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to observe you while you’re asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot episodes of breathlessness. It may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This asks how likely you’ll be to doze off in a number of different situations, such as watching TV or sitting in a meeting. The final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder. For example, a score of 16-24 means you’re excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. A score of eight to nine is considered average during the daytime. An online version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale can be found on the British Lung Foundation website. Seeing your GP Read about for more information about CPAP. Determining the severity of OSA The severity of OSA is determined by how often your breathing is affected over the course of an hour. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). Severity is measured using the following criteria: mild – an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour moderate – an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour severe – an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour Lifestyle changes In most cases of OSA you’ll be advised to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as: losing weight if you’re overweight or obese stopping smoking if you smoke limiting your alcohol consumption, particularly before going to bed – the NHS recommends not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it’s best to spread this evenly over three or more days avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tablets Surgery for OSA tonsillectomy – where the tonsils are removed if they’re enlarged and blocking your airway when you sleep adenoidectomy – where the adenoids, small lumps of tissue at the back of the throat above the tonsils, are removed if they’re enlarged and are blocking the airway during sleep tracheostomy – where a tube is inserted directly into your neck to allow you to breathe freely, even if the airways in your upper throat are blocked weight loss (bariatric) surgery – where the size of the stomach is reduced if you’re severely obese and this is making your sleep apnoea worse Soft palate implants Soft palate implants make the soft palate, part of the roof of the mouth, stiffer and less likely to vibrate and cause an obstruction. The implants are inserted into the soft palate under local anaesthetic . Support groups OSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families. As well as causing physical problems such as tiredness and headaches, the condition can have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others. For support and advice about living with OSA, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as: British Lung Foundation Sleep Apnoea Trust ",
Neuroendocrine tumours,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/neuroendocrine-tumours/,"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. The neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream. NETs are tumours (abnormal growths) that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. NETs can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and often – but not always – grow slowly. There are a number of different types of NET, depending on the specific cells affected. Types of neuroendocrine tumours Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas. Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas. Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours develop in the lungs. Rarely, NETs can also develop in other parts of the body, including in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles. ","For example, a tumour in the digestive system may cause diarrhoea , constipation or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent cough . Some tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream. low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems. ","multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) – a rare inherited condition where tumours in the endocrine system develop, most commonly in the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland and the pancreas neurofibrmatosis type 1 – a group of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along your nerves Research has also shown that your risk of developing a NET is slightly increased if one of your parents has had one in the past. Diagnosing neuroendocrine tumours There are many tests that can be used to diagnose NETs, including blood tests , urine tests, scans, and a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination). Different types of scans may also be used to identify or examine tumours. These include: ultrasound scans – including echocardiograms and endoscopic ultrasound scans computerised tomography (CT) scans magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans positron emission tomography (PET) scans octreotide scans – where mild radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and a special camera is used to highlight any cancerous cells ",,"where the tumour is how advanced your condition is your overall health Unfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after other parts of their body are affected. However, it may still be possible to surgically remove the tumour, even if it has spread to other parts of your body. chemotherapy , radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells). The Cancer Research UK website has more information about neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) . Information about you If you have neuroendocrine tumours, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Oral thrush in adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/oral-thrush-in-adults/,Oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. It’s not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication. It’s also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it’s caused by a group of yeasts called Candida. Contact your GP practice if: ,"white patches (plaques) in the mouth that can often be wiped off, leaving behind red areas that may bleed slightly loss of taste or an unpleasant taste in the mouth redness inside the mouth and throat cracks at the corners of the mouth a painful, burning sensation in the mouth In severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious. Your GP will usually be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. Sometimes they may also recommend blood tests to look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such as diabetes and nutritional deficiencies. ","Low numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. They don’t usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply. There are a number of reasons why this may happen, including: taking a course of antibiotics , particularly over a long period or at a high dose taking inhaled corticosteroid medication for asthma wearing dentures (false teeth), particularly if they don’t fit properly having poor oral hygiene having a dry mouth, either because of a medical condition or a medication you are taking smoking having chemotherapy or radiotherapy to treat cancer Babies, young children and elderly people are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush, as are people with certain underlying conditions, including diabetes, an iron deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency , an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and HIV . As most people already have Candida fungi living in their mouth, oral thrush is not contagious. This means it cannot be passed to others. ",,"Oral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used. Topical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around 7 to 14 days. Tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily. These medications don’t often have side effects, although some can cause nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea . If antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine – or the way it is delivered – may need to be changed or the dosage reduced. Preventing oral thrush There are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush. Do rinse your mouth after meals brush your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride floss regularly visit your dentist regularly for check-ups, even if you wear dentures or have no natural teeth remove your dentures every night and clean them with paste or soap and water before soaking them in a solution of water and denture-cleaning tablets brush your gums, tongue and inside your mouth with a soft brush twice a day if you wear dentures or have no or few natural teeth visit your dentist if your dentures do not fit properly stop smoking if you smoke rinse your mouth with water and spit it out after using a corticosteroid inhaler, and use a spacer (a plastic cylinder that attaches to the inhaler) when you take your medicine ensure that any underlying condition you have, such as diabetes, is well controlled Read more about taking care of your oral health ",
Ovarian cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/ovarian-cancer/,About ovarian cancer ,"how ovarian cancer is diagnosed . The ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation. Different types of ovarian cancer affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes) persistent pelvic and abdominal pain difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous . breast cancer in your family. They may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for an ultrasound scan . If needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . Blood test (CA125) You may have a blood test to look for a protein called CA125 in your blood. CA125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells. A very high level of CA125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer. However, CA125 isn’t specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions including endometriosis , fibroids , pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy, so a raised CA125 level doesn’t definitely mean you have ovarian cancer. The Lab Tests Online UK website has more information on the CA125 test . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance that recommends testing for CA125 if you frequently experience: bloating feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite pelvic or abdominal pain needing to urinate urgently and/or frequently Read the full NICE guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (PDF, 179kb) . If you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such as diarrhoea or constipation , you may also be tested for CA125. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your GP should test your CA125 level. Around half of all women and anyone with ovaries with early-stage ovarian cancer have a raised level of CA125 in their blood. If your CA125 level is raised, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. You may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach. The image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present. Further tests If you’ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and if it’s spread. This is called staging. Other tests you may have include: a chest X-ray a CT scan or MRI scan abdominal fluid aspiration – a thin needle is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells laparoscopy – a thin tube with a camera on the end is inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (a biopsy ) , which can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire . Not feeling like sex palliative care . It also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers. Read further information: Marie Curie Cancer Care: support for people dying at home Preventing ovarian cancer There’s currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. However, there are a number of things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer. Stopping ovulation and the contraceptive pill Each time you ovulate, your ovaries are damaged by the egg as it breaks through the surface of the ovary and is released into your reproductive system. The cells that make up the surface of your ovaries divide and multiply rapidly to repair the damage caused by the egg. It’s this rapid cell growth that can occasionally go wrong and result in ovarian cancer. Anything that stops the process of ovulation can help to minimise your chances of developing ovarian cancer. This includes: pregnancy and breastfeeding the contraceptive pill hysterectomy surgery (removal of the ovaries) Diet and lifestyle Ovarian cancer may be linked to being overweight or obese . Losing weight through regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet may help lower your risk of getting ovarian cancer. Aside from this, regular exercise and a healthy, low-fat diet are extremely beneficial to your overall health, and can help to prevent all forms of cancer and heart disease . Screening for ovarian cancer At present, there’s no screening method for ovarian cancer that is reliable enough to be used by all women and anyone with ovaries in the UK. Clinical trials into this are continuing. You may be eligible for screening if you’re at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history, or if you’ve inherited a specific abnormal gene. If you’re at high risk, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service or family cancer clinic. You may be screened for ovarian cancer when you’re over the age of 35, or when you’re 5 years away from the age at which your youngest relative was diagnosed with the condition. From this point, you’ll be screened again once a year. The screening tests for ovarian cancer are the same as those routinely used to diagnose it. The tests are: a blood test for higher-than-normal levels of CA125 (a protein produced by cancer cells) a transvaginal ultrasound – where an ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina so that the size and texture of your ovaries can be seen, as well as any ovarian cysts that may be present The tests are used together to produce results that are as accurate as possible. However, as these screening methods are still in the process of being tested, there’s no guarantee they’ll identify every case of ovarian cancer. A cervical screening test , previously known as a smear test, can’t detect ovarian cancer. ","Diagnosing ovarian cancer The exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman’s risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past. However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link. Read more about the Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. In ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. If the cancer isn’t identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system. Increased risk The exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn’t known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it. Age Your risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after the menopause . Most cases of ovarian cancer occur in women and anyone with ovaries who are over 50 years of age. Family history If you have 2 or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer or breast cancer , your risk of also developing the condition may be increased. If your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it’s more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. They’re also known to increase the risk of breast cancer. Having relatives with ovarian cancer doesn’t mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family – the cancer could have happened by chance. Only 1 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene. You may be at high risk of having a faulty gene if you have: 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 2 close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother’s or father’s side) 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 1 close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family 2 relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age If you’re at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your GP can refer you for tests to check for faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Ovulation and fertility Every time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. The surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. Each time this happens, there’s a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair. This may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take the contraceptive pill , or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. At these times, eggs aren’t released. Diagnosing ovarian cancer Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you have any ",,"Living with ovarian cancer Preventing ovarian cancer About ovarian cancer Ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has been through the menopause (usually over the age of 50). It can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age. As the Chemotherapy Read more about how ovarian cancer is treated As with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it’s at when diagnosed – that is, how far the cancer has advanced. Being diagnosed with ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of living with ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues. Ovarian cancer screening There are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven’t been fully tested. Screening is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene. Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. A cervical screening test , which used to be called a smear test, can’t detect ovarian cancer. Read more about preventing ovarian cancer infertility itself may increase ovarian cancer risk and research into this area is being carried out. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Women and anyone with ovaries who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is stopped, after 5 years the risk is reduced to the same level as those who’ve never taken HRT. Endometriosis Endometriosis may also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. In endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body. These endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation, occurs in other parts of the body. There’s no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: The Cancer Research UK website has more information on further tests for ovarian cancer . Stages and grades of ovarian cancer Staging If your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer, it will be given a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. The 4 commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are: stage 1 – where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries stage 2 – where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or womb stage 3 – where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis stage 4 – where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, spleen or lungs This is a simplified guide. Each stage is further divided into categories A, B and C. Ask your doctor if you’re not sure what stage you have. Grading The grade of cancer refers to the appearance of cells under a microscope. The grades are as follows: low grade – although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing moderate grade – cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells high grade – cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growing The Cancer Research UK website has more information on the stages and grading of ovarian cancer . Surgery Most people with ovarian cancer will be considered for surgery. It sometimes isn’t possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out. Your doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. It will probably involve removing: both ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) the womb (a total abdominal hysterectomy) the omentum – a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy) The surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread. If it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. This is known as ‘debulking surgery’. If the cancer is confined to 1 or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. This means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy. You will probably be ready to go home 3 to 7 days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover. When you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness.

It’s often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. In some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. This is called ‘neoadjuvant chemotherapy’. Chemotherapy is usually given as a drip into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. Some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen – called ‘intraperitoneal chemotherapy’. It is not currently established routine practice in the UK, but it’s being assessed in clinical trials. Is chemotherapy working? if you had higher than normal levels of the protein CA125 in your blood when diagnosed, you may have blood tests to see whether the levels are falling if you had a tumour visible on a CT scan or ultrasound scan when diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk you may have another small operation, known as ‘second-look surgery’, which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopy Side effects of chemotherapy Side effects of chemotherapy include: infections loss of appetite nausea and vomiting tiredness hair loss sore mouth Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe.

It can bring emotional and practical difficulties. It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support. For example: your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor; talk to your GP if you’re feeling depressed; a course of antidepressants may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist Read further information: Macmillan Cancer Support Living with ovarian cancer Recovery and follow-up Many women and anyone with ovaries with ovarian cancer have a hysterectomy. This is a major operation and takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. During this time, you’ll have to avoid lifting things, such as children and heavy shopping bags, and doing heavy housework. You won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. You’ll usually need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. If your ovaries have been removed and you haven’t already been through the menopause hormone replacement therapy (HRT) chemotherapy , can make you feel very tired. You may need a break from your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse who to contact. Sex and relationships Relationships with friends and family Having cancer isn’t always easy to talk about, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people avoid you or feel awkward around you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease.

Diet advice These changes can include: increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you’re drinking enough fluid to reduce constipation increasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with low blood pressure , such as dizziness when you stand up quickly making changes to your diet to avoid unintentional weight loss You may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you may benefit from changing your diet. Medication However, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different. Three main types of medication are commonly used: levodopa dopamine agonists monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors Your specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change. However, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years – as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. This means the dose may need to be increased from time to time. Long-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and “on-off” effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off). Dopamine agonists Dopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared with levodopa. They can often be given less frequently than levodopa. They are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine). Sometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used. Possible side effects of dopamine agonists include: nausea or vomiting tiredness and sleepiness dizziness Dopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible. For some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours, especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido. Talk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems. As the person themselves may not realise the problem, it’s key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity. If you’re prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects. The dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. If nausea becomes a problem, your GP may prescribe anti-sickness medication. A potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep. This generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable. People are usually advised to avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs. Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors MAO-B inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally cause side effects, including: nausea headache abdominal pain high blood pressure Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson’s disease. They prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme COMT. Side effects of COMT inhibitors include: nausea or vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain Non-oral therapies Apomorphine A dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either by: a single injection, when required a continuous infusion using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bag Duodopa If you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used. This medication comes as a gel that’s continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall. There’s an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you. These include: depression and anxiety – this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more about Be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. Don’t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you want. Support If you have any questions about your condition, your GP or Parkinson’s disease specialist nurse may be able to help. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have details of these. Some people find it helpful to talk to others with Parkinson’s disease, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room. Care and support services It’s worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what would help you achieve the best quality of life. For example, you may wish to consider equipment, help in your home, and home adaptations. Parkinson’s UK Parkinson’s UK is the main Parkinson’s support and research charity in the UK.

Work and finances These problems can still be helped by adjustment or addition of some of the medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease , under the supervision of a doctor with a specialist interest in Parkinson’s disease. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, you’ll be invited to discuss the care you want with your healthcare team as you near the end of your life. This is known as palliative care. Palliative care can be provided at home or in a hospice, residential home or hospital. You may want to consider talking to your family and care team in advance about where you’d like to be treated and what care you wish to receive. ","Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain. Read more about the Who’s affected? It’s thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson’s disease, which means there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition. Parkinson’s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means the part of the brain controlling movement can’t work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal. Currently, it’s believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition. Genetics A number of genetic factors have been shown to increase a person’s risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear. Parkinson’s disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to a child by their parents. However, it’s rare for the disease to be inherited this way. Environmental factors Some researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person’s risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. It’s been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition. However, the evidence linking environmental factors to Parkinson’s disease is inconclusive. ","Being told you have Parkinson’s disease can be emotionally distressing, and the news can often be difficult to take in.

You may find it hard to cope financially if you do have to stop work or work part-time because of your condition. However, you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support: You are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness. You may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness. You may be eligible for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) , which replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) , if you’re aged 64 and under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties. You may be able to get Attendance Allowance if you’re aged 65 or over. You may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance if you’re caring for someone with Parkinson’s disease. You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income. Driving If you’ve been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and your insurance company. You won’t necessarily have to stop driving. You’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition, as well as details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive. Complex Parkinson’s disease and palliative care ","Living with Parkinson’s disease About Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years. occupational therapy medication in some cases, brain surgery Outlook Parkinson’s disease doesn’t directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections. Read more about living with Parkinson’s disease It may also be useful to read your guide to care and support – written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives. Levodopa Most people with Parkinson’s disease eventually need a medication called levodopa. Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement. Increasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems. It is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa. These medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain. They also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include: feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting tiredness dizziness If you’re prescribed levodopa, the initial dose is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect. They block the effects of an enzyme or brain substance that breaks down dopamine (monoamine oxidase-B), increasing dopamine levels. Surgery Most people with Parkinson’s disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is used in some cases. This surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the UK, but it’s not suitable for everyone. If surgery is being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. Deep brain stimulation Deep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall. This is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain. A tiny electric current is produced by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by Parkinson’s disease. problems sleeping (insomnia) – this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more about erectile dysfunction – this can be treated with medication; read more about excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) – this can be reduced using a prescription antiperspirant, or surgery in severe cases; read more about swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) – this can be improved by eating softened food, or by using a feeding tube in more severe cases; read more about excessive drooling – this can be improved with swallowing exercises, or surgery or medication in severe cases urinary incontinence – this can be treated with exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, medication, or surgery in severe cases; read more about dementia – this can be treated with cognitive therapies and medication in some cases; read more about Clinical trials All clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted.

If you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. Complementary and alternative therapies Some types of herbal remedies, such as St John’s wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat Parkinson’s disease. Living with Parkinson’s disease It’s important to do what you can to stay physically and mentally healthy if you have Parkinson’s disease. Exercise and healthy eating Regular exercise is particularly important in helping relieve muscle stiffness, improving your mood, and relieving stress. There are many activities you can do to help keep yourself fit, ranging from more active sports like tennis and cycling , to less strenuous activities such as walking , gardening and yoga . You should also try to eat a balanced diet containing all the food groups to give your body the nutrition it needs to stay healthy. Vaccinations Everyone with a long-term condition is encouraged to get a yearly flu jab each autumn. The pneumococcal vaccination is also usually recommended, which is a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia. Relationships and support Being diagnosed with a long-term condition like Parkinson’s disease can put a strain on you, your family and friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they’re close to you. ",
Pancreatic cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/pancreatic-cancer/,About pancreatic cancer ,"pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten unexpected weight loss nausea and vomiting bowel changes fever and shivering indigestion blood clots diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin. Endocrine pancreatic cancer To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . This type of surgery won’t cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable. To help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin – the yellow chemical in bile – from building up and causing jaundice. If a stent isn’t a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. Your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away. These types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. The recovery time is much quicker, and people find that their jaundice improves significantly. Chemotherapy Some chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously). the exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body the endocrine pancreas produces hormones – including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stable pain in the stomach or back jaundice weight loss Pain in the stomach or back Pancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may spread to your back. To begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer. The pain is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten. You may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged. Weight loss Many types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need. Pancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body. If a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods. This can cause you to lose weight and become malnourished. Jaundice Jaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body. excessive thirst urinating frequently – particularly at night extreme tiredness weight loss and loss of muscle bulk You may develop diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin. itching (if you have jaundice) nausea and vomiting bowel changes fever and shivering indigestion blood clots Endocrine pancreatic cancer Endocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon. If you visit your GP with , they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice. They may also test your urine for bile, or carry out a blood test . This is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer. Your GP may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. The pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it’s covered by part of the bowel. This can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination. If your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll be referred for further testing at a hospital. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scan is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body. If pancreatic cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal. However, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren’t very good at penetrating deep into body tissues. Computerised tomography (CT) scan A computerised tomography (CT) scan produces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series of X-ray images. Your doctor can use the results of a CT scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of X-rays. MRI scans are carried out in a tube-shaped MRI scanner. It’s a noisy procedure that can feel claustrophobic. It also takes longer than other types of scans. Like a CT scan, an MRI scan allows your doctor to check for signs of cancer in other parts of the body. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Before the scan, you’ll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as a tracer. The amount of radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal X-ray. The most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar). You’ll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy. The scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. The tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue. Endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) If a small shadow is seen on a CT or MRI scan but it’s not obvious what it is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) can be carried out. During EUS, a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas. Before the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. EUS can also be used to take a biopsy for further examination. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if someone has jaundice. During ERCP, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. The endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, an X-ray will be taken. The dye will show up on the X-ray and will highlight any tumour that’s blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts. During the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. These samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous. ERCP can take 30 to 60 minutes. As with EUS, you’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax. Laparoscopy A laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis. During the procedure, a small incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin, flexible microscope) will be inserted. This will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn’t spread before recommending its removal. This procedure will be carried out under a general anaesthetic (where you’re put to sleep so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort). Biopsy A biopsy involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which can then be tested to see if it’s cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). A biopsy can be carried out during an EUS, ERCP or laparoscopy using a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells. It’s also possible for a biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. The needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or CT scan. Recovering pancreatic cancer Recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process. You’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief. After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away. You’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation. After the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course of chemotherapy , which greatly increases your chance of being cured. However, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely. ","Diagnosing pancreatic cancer Recovering pancreatic cancer About pancreatic cancer Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that’s part of the digestive system. Around half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. It’s uncommon in people under 40 years of age. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include: age – it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age smoking – around 1 in 3 cases is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco having a history of certain health conditions – such as diabetes , chronic pancreatitis (long-term inflammation of the pancreas), stomach ulcer and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection) In about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person’s parents. Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas. Cancer Research UK has more information on on their website Diagnosing pancreatic cancer Your GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged. They’ll also check your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice and may request a urine sample and blood test . If your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either: an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan a positron emission tomography (PET) scan – where you’re given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image Depending on the results of a scan, further tests may include: an endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) endoscopy – a type of endoscopy which allows close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) – a type of endoscopy which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an X-ray and highlight any tumours a laparoscopy – a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy (a thin, flexible microscope) A biopsy , where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures. NICE guidelines In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Bilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and into the intestine. Jaundice is more often a sign of conditions such as gallstones or hepatitis than it is of cancer. However, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up in the body. Diabetes The pancreas produces the hormone insulin. Without it, the body can’t move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells. The exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn’t fully understood. However, there are a number of risk factors that can increase your chances of developing it. Age Pancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. Almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over. Smoking Research has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated with smoking and other tobacco use. Smoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas. This is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation within your body’s organs and tissues. Diabetes If you have diabetes , your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be increased. However, it’s important to remember that diabetes is very common and most people with diabetes won’t develop pancreatic cancer. As well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it’s also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis and hereditary pancreatitis Chronic pancreatitis (long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but isn’t responsible for many cases. Chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-term alcohol misuse . Although it’s a very rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population. Helicobacter pylori infection Helicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer. Research has shown that a Helicobacter pylori infection may slightly increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. However, the risk is thought to be small because most people with this infection don’t get cancer of the pancreas. Other known risk factors There are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These are: long-term hepatitis tooth or gum disease heavy alcohol use a previous history of certain types of cancer previously having radiotherapy diet , weight and level of physical activity The Cancer Research UK website has more information about these other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer .

You’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief. After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away.

You may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation. After the tumour has been removed, you’ll probably have a six-month course of chemotherapy , which greatly increases your chance of being cured. But because cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely. The first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body. If this isn’t possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm. There are 3 main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated: surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy Cancer Research UK has more information about . Surgery Surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. However, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it’s diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20% of people. However, this isn’t a suitable option if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. If your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won’t cure you. Surgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of health. This is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow. Sometimes the risks of surgery can outweigh the potential benefits. Your doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option. Whipple procedure The Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas. Your surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores bile) and part of your bile duct. Sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed. The end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. This allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into your system. After this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food. The Whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it’s easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy. Distal pancreatectomy A distal pancreatectomy involves removing the tail and body of your pancreas. Your spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. Part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed. Like the Whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation that won’t be carried out unless your doctor thinks it’s necessary. Total pancreatectomy During a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. This is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour. Your surgeon will also remove your: bile duct gall bladder spleen part of your small intestine part of your stomach (sometimes) surrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system) After a total pancreatectomy, you’ll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. You’ll also have diabetes for the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin – the hormone that regulates blood sugar. Removing your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood’s ability to clot. This means you’ll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you’re allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you’ll need to have regular vaccinations. Sometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. Platelets are a type of blood cell that cause your blood to clot (thicken). Chemotherapy may be given: before surgery – to try to shrink the cancer, so there’s a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer after surgery – to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back vomiting nausea mouth sores fatigue increased risk of infection The chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of 2 or 3. Combining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects. Sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits.

Thyroid function tests Your GP will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones) TSH is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. When the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of TSH. When thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH. When the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to boost it. If you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of TSH in your blood are consistently lower than normal. Low levels of TSH mean your thyroid gland is overactive and likely to be making excessive thyroid hormones. This is the first part of the thyroid function test. Your GP will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. If you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones. Subclinical overactive thyroid gland In some cases, tests may show you have normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of TSH. fever gum pain, swelling and bleeding sore throat mouth ulcers persistent cough shortness of breath 111 or your local out-of-hours service. Beta-blockers Beta-blockers, Your specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. However, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma. Beta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including: feeling sick feeling tired all the time (fatigue) cold hands and feet trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares Thionamides or radioiodine? It is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means there will be no chance of a relapse. However, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland – these will be the same medications used to treat an underactive thyroid gland . Complications of an overactive thyroid Several complications can occur with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), particularly if the condition is not treated. Graves’ ophthalmopathy If you have Graves’ disease, you may have problems with your eyes. This is known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy and is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the tissues of the eyes. It affects around 1 in 20 people with Graves’ disease. eyes feeling dry and gritty sensitivity to light (photophobia) excessive tearing double vision some loss of vision a feeling of pressure behind the eyes In more severe cases, your eyes can bulge prominently from your eye sockets. sunglasses to protect the eyes against bright lights corticosteroids to reduce inflammation radiotherapy surgery Pregnancy and overactive thyroid Pregnant women with an overactive thyroid are at an increased risk of developing complications during pregnancy and birth, such as miscarriage and eclampsia . They are also more at risk of going into labour prematurely and having a baby with a low birthweight. being sensitive to cold weight gain constipation depression tiredness An underactive thyroid gland is treated using medications to help replicate the effects of the thyroid hormones.

If you think you or someone in your care is experiencing this complication, you need to phone 999 for an ambulance. ","Diagnosing an overactive thyroid The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body’s growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine. They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body’s metabolism. Read more about the Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine. Overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions. Graves’ disease Graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves’ disease if you smoke. Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition. This means the immune system mistakes something in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it. In Graves’ disease, it attacks the thyroid gland, which leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones. It is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved. If you have Graves’ disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy. You may find your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent. For more information on Graves’ ophthalmopathy, read complications of an overactive thyroid gland . Thyroid nodules It is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign). However, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic. Toxic thyroid nodules account for about 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism. Iodine supplements Iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism – sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland. Amiodarone Amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) . If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine. Amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Follicular thyroid cancer In rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of thyroid cancer that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer. Diagnosing an overactive thyroid See your GP if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) . ",,"Complications of an overactive thyroid About overactive thyroids Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body. thionamides – a group of medications, including carbimazole and methimazole, that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone surgery – in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) . However, an underactive thyroid is not usually serious and is easily treated. Read more about the Complications In most cases, the reduced level of TSH in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself. However, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored. Determining the underlying cause If tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause. An additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. This involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form. A scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland. If your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely the underlying cause is either Graves’ disease or thyroid nodules. If the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to: swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection having too much iodine in your diet in rare cases, thyroid cancer Thionamides As thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between 4 to 8 weeks). Once the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication. You may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control. Around 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as: itchy skin rash joint pain These side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication. In rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection. Advantages of thionamides include: they are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them there is less risk of getting an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) Disadvantages of thionamides include: there is a higher risk of side effects Surgery Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. It is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid. Your specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck. Other reasons for surgery include: a person has a severe form of Graves’ ophthalmopathy Underactive thyroid Thyroid storm An undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a rare but serious reaction called a thyroid storm. It affects around 1 in 100 people with an overactive thyroid gland. ",
Paget’s disease of the nipple,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/pagets-disease-of-the-nipple/,About Paget’s disease of the nipple Diagnosing Paget’s disease of the nipple ,"Paget’s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and produces , appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola). It can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to psoriasis . itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple bleeding from the skin of the nipple If you’re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn’t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be Paget’s disease but should still be checked by a doctor. how Paget’s disease is diagnosed whether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer your age and whether you have experienced the menopause (when a woman’s monthly periods stop) whether you’re taking any medication, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) oral contraceptive pill how much alcohol you drink how much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight If your GP thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests. Breast clinic When you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have, what type of breast cancer. Staff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur. Tests carried out at the clinic may include the following: an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities a mammogram (if you are 35 years of age or over) an ultrasound scan – which is the first line of investigation used in younger women a skin biopsy will be carried out if Paget’s disease is suspected Mammogram A mammogram is a simple procedure that uses X-rays to create an image of the inside of your breasts. It can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump. Younger women often have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. Therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. If you’re under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead. Your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery. ","Paget’s disease is usually a sign of breast cancer in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple. The breast cancer can either be: invasive – where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue non-invasive – where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread In a small amount of cases, the only evidence of Paget’s disease is the nipple changes. In about half of all cases of Paget’s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. The majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread. Most people with Paget’s disease of the nipple who don’t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer. Diagnosing Paget’s disease You should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple). As Paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. Speak to your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. While most breast lumps are not cancerous, it’s important you have it checked out. Read more about: the ","breast cancer and the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. Your GP will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with one of them. They may also ask you: During a mammogram, the radiographer will position 1 of your breasts on a flat X-ray plate. A second X-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the 2 plates. An X-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast. Having a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. Your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer. Breast ultrasound If you are under 35 years of age, a breast ultrasound may be recommended. This is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. The image will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts. Skin biopsy A skin biopsy is used to diagnose Paget’s disease. A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous. Further tests ","Preventing Paget’s disease of the nipple About Paget’s disease of the nipple Paget’s disease of the nipple, also known as Paget’s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer. The term Paget’s disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget’s disease of the bone, which occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed. A similar type of skin cancer can also occur in other parts of the body. The rest of this section will use the term Paget’s disease to refer to Paget’s disease of the nipple or breast. Paget’s disease is treated in the same way as breast cancer. This may be followed by a combination of: chemotherapy – where powerful medication is used to destroy cancerous cells radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells biological or hormone therapy – which can be used to treat certain types of cancer If Paget’s disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there’s a good chance of recovery. Read more about how Paget’s disease is treated. Preventing Paget’s disease Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer , including breast cancer. However, these factors remain controversial. Screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 47 years of age or over. Read more about preventing breast cancer . Risk factors for breast cancer There are a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. These include: age – your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you get older family history – if you have a number of close relatives with breast cancer, your chances of also developing the condition are increased previously being diagnosed with breast cancer previously having a benign breast lump – certain types of benign lump may slightly increase your risk but this is only seen in a small number of women being overweight – which is especially significant in post-menopausal women alcohol – your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink Information about you If you have Paget’s disease of the nipple, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register . Diagnosing Paget’s disease of the nipple As Paget’s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it’s very important you speak to your GP if you notice changes to the tissue or skin of your breast. In particular, you should tell your GP if you notice any changes to: the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple) your breasts, particularly lumps in your breast Paget’s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with eczema Paget’s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer. It’s usually treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast – a procedure known as a mastectomy. Surgery mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast breast-conserving surgery – surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast These types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola). Mastectomy A mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. You may need to have a mastectomy if: the tumour is large or in the centre of your breast there is more than one area of breast cancer breast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable results If lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. This is a long-term condition, but can be treated with: massage compression sleeves – tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your arm Lymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. See your breast care nurse or GP if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation. Breast-conserving surgery Breast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue. If you have Paget’s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. You should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery. If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on: the size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast whether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breast Your surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast. radiotherapy ) to destroy any remaining cancer cells. Breast reconstruction If you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. This can be done by: inserting a breast implant using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast The reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. You should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision. For example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple. Creating a nipple A nipple can be created by: having a nipple tattooed onto the skin using your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time using a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washing Prostheses If you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the NHS. After having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years. chemotherapy – cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually X-rays , are used to destroy cancer cells biological therapy – if your breast cancer is HER2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells hormone therapy – if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects Preventing Paget’s disease of the nipple A number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including Paget’s disease of the nipple. Diet and lifestyle Exercising regularly and eating a healthy, balanced diet are known to help prevent many forms of cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes . Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight , do regular exercise and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol . It has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week) can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by up to a third. If you have been through the menopause (when your monthly periods stop), it’s particularly important you are not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. Breastfeeding Studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t. The reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable. Medication In June 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t. These medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots or womb cancer , or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. Women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small. Breast screening Breast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. The procedure uses mammograms, where X-rays are taken, to create an image of the inside of your breasts. The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 50 years of age or over. The NHS has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47 to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening. NHS breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. This is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities. Speak to your GP if you are below screening age, worried about changes in your breasts, or have a family history of breast cancer. Read more information about breast cancer screening . ",

Panic disorder,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/panic-disorder/,Introduction ,"Panic attacks nausea sweating trembling a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) The number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week. Read more about the . Panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they’re not dangerous. An attack won’t cause you any physical harm, and it’s unlikely that you’ll be admitted to hospital if you’ve had a panic attack. mitral valve prolapse postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS) anaemia paroxysmal atrial tachycardia – episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly thyrotoxicosis – where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating , tremor and anxiety poorly controlled diabetes adrenal tumours – growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys) You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. Read more about how panic disorder is diagnosed . a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly ( palpitations ) sweating trembling hot flushes chills shortness of breath a choking sensation chest pain nausea dizziness feeling faint numbness or pins and needles dry mouth a need to go to the toilet ringing in your ears a feeling of dread or a fear of dying a churning stomach a tingling sensation in your fingers shivering shaking For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which creates a cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic. heart attack . Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes. Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack. Recurrent panic attacks People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week. People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable. If you have panic disorder, you may also feel anxious about when your next attack will be. Depersonalisation This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating. Although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life, try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Physical examination For example, an overactive thyroid After you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you’re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it’s important that your progress is carefully monitored. If your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular blood tests or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don’t show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect. When you and your GP decide that it’s appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs unless your GP specifically advises you to. dizziness numbness and tingling nausea and vomiting headache anxiety sleep disturbances sweating Contact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that don’t ease. Tricyclic antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood. Imipramine and clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren’t addictive. SSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include: constipation difficulty urinating blurred vision dry mouth weight gain or weight loss drowsiness sweating lightheadedness skin rash The side effects should ease after seven to 10 days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don’t ease. Pregabalin Pregabalin is another medication that’s often used to treat panic disorder. It’s an anticonvulsant that’s also used to treat epilepsy . psychiatrist – a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication Some of these techniques are listed below. Stay where you are If possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. The attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it’s safe to do so if you’re driving. Focus If you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass. During an attack, try to focus on something that’s non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket. Slow deep breathing While you’re having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. Feelings of panic and anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly. Try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out. Challenge your fear When you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. You can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn’t real and that it will pass in a few minutes. Creative visualisation Many things can go through your mind during a panic attack – for example, some people think about disaster or death. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images. Thinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you’ve got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. Creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others. Don’t fight a panic attack Fighting a panic attack can often make it worse. Trying to resist the attack and finding you’re unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic. Relaxation If you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. Learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur. Some people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. Activities, such as yoga and pilates Exercise Regular exercise , particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. It can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood. It’s recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking , every week. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). Visit your GP for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven’t exercised before or for a long time. Read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults . Diet Unstable blood sugar levels can contribute to the . Therefore, you should maintain a healthy, balanced diet , eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. Also, avoid caffeine, alcohol and smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks. Complications Panic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it’s very important you seek medical help as soon as possible. Screening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what’s causing your child’s panic attacks. Panic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation). The specialist may recommend a course of psychotherapy for your child, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Drug and alcohol misuse Some studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem. . give up smoking (if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet. ","As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood. However, it’s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors. Read about the possible . hypoglycaemia ) Diagnosing panic disorder As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood. It’s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below. Traumatic life experiences A trauma, such as bereavement , can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later. Genetics Having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person’s risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn’t known. Neurotransmitters Neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It’s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder. Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide Some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks. Catastrophic thinking Side effects of pregabalin can include: drowsiness dizziness increased appetite and weight gain blurred vision headaches dry mouth vertigo – the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs. Clonazepam Clonazepam is another medication that’s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder. It can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions. Referral ","Everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks. However, not everyone who has panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder. Panic attacks Some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space. While most people with phobias only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason. This means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. Talk to your GP ","Things you can do to help yourself Complications Introduction Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason. Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It’s a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations. However, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time. Anxiety Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including phobias – an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal Read more about and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack . Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It’s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. GOV.UK has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition . Complications of panic disorder Left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias . Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong. Read more about the complications of panic disorder . If you’re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn’t work, medication may be recommended. Cognitive behavioural therapy The therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you’re experiencing an attack. Once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks. For example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) NICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with ‘homework’ being set between sessions so that you can practice what you’ve learnt after each session. You should visit your GP regularly while you’re having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you’re doing. Support groups Support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They’re also a good way of meeting other people who’ve had similar experiences of the condition. Panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you. Anxiety UK and Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK) are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders. Support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing. Ask your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to find anxiety services in your area . Antidepressants Antidepressants are often associated with depression , but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions. Antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It’s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they’re not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Common side effects of SSRIs include: nausea headaches low sex drive (loss of libido) blurred vision diarrhoea or constipation dizziness dry mouth loss of appetite sweating feeling agitated insomnia (sleep problems) abdominal pain Things you can do to help yourself Left undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions. Agoraphobia and other phobias Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong. If you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. Many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia. Agoraphobia is one of the conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. People with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place. You may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you’ll have difficulty getting help if you need it. You may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic attack. If you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you’re not with a trusted family member or a friend. If you have panic disorder, you may also develop other fears and phobias , which can often seem irrational. For example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things. Children Panic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children. Panic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. Severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. The fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. They may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork. Diagnosing panic disorder ",
Peripheral neuropathy,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/peripheral-neuropathy/,About peripheral neuropathy ,"In the UK, it’s estimated that almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over are affected by some degree of peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including: sensory nerves – responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch motor nerves – responsible for controlling muscles autonomic nerves – responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function numbness and tingling in the feet or hands burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas loss of balance and co-ordination muscle weakness, especially in the feet When to see your GP pain, tingling or loss of sensation in the feet loss of balance or weakness a cut or ulcer on your foot that isn’t getting better It’s recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes, have regular check-ups. Generally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications. Read more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy The main types of peripheral neuropathy include: sensory neuropathy – damage to the nerves that carry messages of touch, temperature, pain and other sensations to the brain motor neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control movement autonomic neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control involuntary bodily processes, such as digestion, bladder function and control of blood pressure mononeuropathy – damage to a single nerve outside of the central nervous system In many cases, someone with peripheral neuropathy may have more than one of these types at the same time. A combination of sensory and motor neuropathy is particularly common (sensorimotor polyneuropathy). Sensory neuropathy prickling and tingling sensation in the affected body part pins and needles numbness and less of an ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, particularly in your feet a burning or sharp pain, usually in the feet feeling pain from something that should not be painful at all, such as a very light touch (allodynia) loss of balance or co-ordination caused by less ability to tell the position of the feet or hands (sensory ataxia) Motor neuropathy twitching and muscle cramps muscle weakness or paralysis affecting one or more muscles thinning (wasting) of muscles foot drop – difficulty lifting up the front part of your foot and toes, particularly noticeable when walking Autonomic neuropathy constipation or diarrhoea , particularly at night feeling sick, bloating and belching low blood pressure (postural or orthostatic hypotension), which can make you feel faint or dizzy when standing up rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) excessive sweating or a lack of sweating problems with sexual function, such as erectile dysfunction in men difficulty fully emptying your bladder of urine bowel incontinence (loss of bowel control) Mononeuropathy altered sensation or weakness in the fingers double vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain weakness of one side of your face Bell’s palsy foot or shin pain, weakness or altered sensation The most common type of mononeuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The carpal tunnel is a small tunnel in your wrist. In CTS, the median nerve becomes compressed where it passes through this tunnel, which may cause tingling, pain or numbness in the fingers. If the cause is uncertain, you may be referred to a neurologist for more extensive blood tests to check: whether you have a rare acquired cause that may be responsible whether you have a genetic abnormality, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease You may need a lumbar puncture to test the cerebrospinal fluid (a clear, colourless fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord) for inflammation. Further tests Occasionally, a nerve biopsy For example, if you have muscle weakness, you may need physiotherapy to learn exercises to improve your muscle strength. You may also need to wear splints to support weak ankles or use walking aids to help you get around. Other problems associated with peripheral neuropathy may be treatable with medication, such as: erectile dysfunction constipation the slow movement of food through your stomach (gastroparesis) an inability to exercise for more than a very short period of time orthostatic hypotension – a type of low blood pressure that can make you feel dizzy or faint when you stand up standing or sitting up slowly and gradually drinking plenty of fluids to increase the volume of your blood and raise your blood pressure wearing compression stockings to help prevent blood falling back down into your legs tilting your bed by raising it at the head end In some cases, medication may be required to treat orthostatic hypotension. Two widely used medications are: fludrocortisone – which works by increasing the volume of your blood midodrine – which works by tightening your blood vessels A more serious concern with CAN is that your heart may suddenly develop an abnormal pattern of beating (arrhythmia), which could lead to a cardiac arrest, where your heart stops beating altogether. To prevent this, you may be prescribed medication to help regulate the beating of your heart, such as flecainide, beta-blockers or amiodarone. If you have CAN, you’ll probably need to have regular check-ups so your heart function can be monitored. ","Diagnosing peripheral neuropathy In the UK, diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy. physical injury to the nerves a viral infection such as shingles a side effect of certain medications or drinking too much alcohol People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed. Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medications called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers are often ineffective. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the UK. Neuropathy can also be caused by other health conditions and certain medications. In some cases, no cause can be identified and this is termed idiopathic neuropathy. Diabetes Peripheral neuropathy caused by either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes is called diabetic polyneuropathy. It’s probably caused by high levels of glucose in your blood damaging the tiny blood vessels that supply your nerves. Peripheral neuropathy becomes more likely the longer you’ve had diabetes. Up to 1 in every 4 people with the condition experience some pain caused by nerve damage. If you have diabetes, your risk of polyneuropathy is higher if your blood sugar is poorly controlled or you: smoke regularly consume large amounts of alcohol are over 40 years old If you have diabetes, you should examine your own feet regularly to check for ulcers (open wounds or sores) or chilblains. Health conditions Some of the health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include: excessive alcohol drinking for years low levels of vitamin B12 or other vitamins physical damage to the nerves – such as from an injury or during surgery an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) certain infections – such as shingles , Lyme disease , diphtheria, botulism and HIV inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) – the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system) and multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer) Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and other types of hereditary motor sensory neuropathy – genetic conditions that cause nerve damage, particularly in the feet having high levels of toxins in your body, such as arsenic, lead or mercury amyloidosis – a group of rare but serious conditions caused by deposits of abnormal protein called amyloid in tissues and organs throughout the body conditions caused by overactivity of the immune system – such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus or Sjogren’s syndrome Medication A few medications may sometimes cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect in some people. These include: some types of chemotherapy for cancer – especially for bowel cancer , lymphoma or myeloma some antibiotics, if taken for months – such as metronidazole or nitrofurantoin phenytoin – used to treat epilepsy – if taken for a long time amiodarone and thalidomide Diagnosing peripheral neuropathy A number of tests may be used to diagnose peripheral neuropathy and its underlying cause. diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency . Confirming if you have a neuropathy Some people may need to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system) in hospital for further tests such as: a nerve conduction test (NCS) – where small metal wires called electrodes are placed on your skin which release tiny electric shocks that stimulate your nerves; the speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured electromyography (EMG) – where a small needle is inserted through your skin into your muscle and used to measure the electrical activity of your muscles NCS and EMG are usually carried out at the same time. Identifying the cause of a neuropathy Your GP can usually identify the underlying cause of a peripheral neuropathy. diabetes is well controlled may help improve neuropathy or at least stop it getting worse. , some of which can be treated in different ways. For example: diabetes can sometimes be controlled by lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly vitamin B12 deficiency can be treated with B12 injections or tablets peripheral neuropathy caused by a medication you’re taking may improve if the medication is stopped Some less common types of peripheral neuropathy may be treated with medication, such as: corticosteroids – powerful anti-inflammatory medication immunosuppressants – medications that reduce the activity of the immune system injections of immunoglobulin – mixture of blood proteins called antibodies made by the immune system However, the underlying cause may not always be untreatable. Relieving nerve pain You may also require medication to treat any nerve pain (neuropathic pain) you’re experiencing. Unlike most other types of pain, neuropathic pain doesn’t usually get better with common painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen and other medications are often used. These should usually be started at the minimum dose, with the dose gradually increased until you notice an effect, because the ideal dose for each person is unpredictable. Higher doses may be better at managing the pain, but are also more likely to cause side effects. The most common side effects are tiredness, dizziness or feeling “drunk”. If you get these, it may be necessary to reduce your dose. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you experience drowsiness or blurred vision. You also may become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol. The side effects should improve after a week or two as your body gets used to the medication. However, if your side effects continue, tell your GP as it may be possible to change to a different medication that suits you better. Even if the first medication tried doesn’t help, others may. ","It’s then checked for changes that could be a sign of certain types of peripheral neuropathy. However, nerve biopsies are rarely needed. You may also need a scan to look for any underlying cause of your neuropathy, such as: an X-ray a computerised tomography (CT) scan a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan ","Complications of peripheral neuropathy About peripheral neuropathy . Complications of peripheral neuropathy The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged. Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time. If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy isn’t treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated. pacemaker . Read more about complications of peripheral neuropathy There are many different possible antidepressant , this may treat pain even if you’re not depressed. This doesn’t mean your doctor suspects you’re depressed. The main medications recommended for neuropathic pain include: headaches and depression pregabalin and gabapentin – also used to treat epilepsy , headaches or anxiety There are also some additional medications that can be used to relieve pain in a specific area of the body or to relieve particularly severe pain for short periods. These are described below. Capsaicin cream If your pain is confined to a particular area of your body and you can’t, or would prefer not to, take the medications above, you may benefit from using capsaicin cream. Capsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot and is thought to work in neuropathic pain by stopping the nerves sending pain messages to the brain. A pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream is rubbed on the painful area of skin three or four times a day. Don’t use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it. Lidocaine plaster This is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic. It’s useful when pain affects only a small area of skin. It’s stuck over the area of painful skin and the local anaesthetic is absorbed into the skin that’s covered. Tramadol Like all opioids, tramadol can be addictive if it’s taken for a long time. It will usually only be prescribed for a short time. Tramadol can be useful to take at times when your pain is worse. Common side effects of tramadol include: feeling sick or vomiting dizziness constipation hyperhidrosis or urinary catheterisation if you have problems emptying your bladder. Complications of peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy can sometimes cause other medical problems, such as foot ulcers and heart rhythm changes, and blood circulation problems. These complications vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Diabetic foot ulcer A diabetic foot ulcer is an open wound or sore on the skin that’s slow to heal. These are common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy. If you have numb feet, it’s easy to cut your foot by stepping on something sharp. An ulcer can also occur if you unknowingly develop a blister caused by badly fitting shoes. If you don’t feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting the blister. If the cut or blister gets worse, it may develop into an ulcer. High blood sugar can damage your blood vessels, causing the blood supply to your feet to become restricted. A reduced blood supply to the skin on your feet means it receives a lower number of infection-fighting cells, which can mean wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene. Gangrene If you do develop a wound infection in one of your feet as a result of peripheral neuropathy, there’s a risk this could lead to gangrene (death of part of the skin or underlying tissues). If gangrene does develop, you may need surgery to remove the damaged tissue (known as debridement) and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In severe cases your toe or foot may need to be amputated. If you have diabetes, you should take extra care of your feet. Get your feet checked regularly by a podiatrist (a medical professional, also known as a chiropodist, who specialises in foot care). Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is another potentially serious problem that’s common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy. CAN occurs when damage to the peripheral nerves disrupts the automatic functions that control your blood circulation and heartbeat. ",
Pelvic organ prolapse,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/pelvic-organ-prolapse/,,"cervical screening test (smear test) Speak to your doctor if: a feeling of a bulge or something coming down the vagina a feeling of a bulge or something coming out the vagina, which sometimes needs pushed back up (you may be able to see this with a mirror) discomfort during sex problems peeing – a slow stream, a feeling of not emptying your bladder fully, needing to go to the toilet a lot or leaking Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) HRT replaces the female hormones that are at a lower level as you experience the menopause. Surgery It’s ok to ask any questions about your care to help you get the information you might need. You can then take some time to decide what the best option is for you. ","Pelvic organ prolapse isn’t life-threatening. In some cases it can cause little or no problems. However, in more severe cases, it may feel very uncomfortable. It might stop you doing the things that you enjoy, and affect your quality of life. Like incontinence, prolapse isn’t inevitable part of ageing. Speak to your doctor if you think you might have a prolapse. You don’t need to suffer or feel embarrassed. Many women can experience prolapse, but it can be treated. There isn’t usually one cause, but the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse is increased by: age – prolapse is more common as you get older, but it’s not an inevitable part of ageing childbirth – particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or have given birth to a large baby or multiple babies menopause – related to lower levels of oestrogen or weaker tissue being overweight having large fibroids or pelvic cysts which create a lot of pressure in the pelvis previous surgery on the pelvis – such as a hysterectomy repeated heavy lifting or manual work long term coughing or sneezing (caused by smoking, a lung condition or allergies) straining too much when going to the toilet for a poo because of long term constipation ","A prolapse is a common condition. Seeing your doctor earlier may help you manage it more easily. Your doctor will need to carry out a pelvic examination, which will include an internal examination of your vagina. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have. As this is an intimate examination, the doctor may have another person (chaperone) present. You can ask for a female doctor or health professional if you prefer. The internal examination is similar to a smear test and should only take a few minutes. Your doctor will discuss with you if they think any further tests are needed. Types of prolapse Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of vagina. The main types of prolapse are: anterior prolapse (cystocele) – where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina prolapse of the womb and / or cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) – where the womb and / or cervix bulges down in to the vagina ‘vault’ prolapse – this can be as a result of a total hysterectomy where the new ‘top’ of the vagina bulges downwards posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) – when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina You can have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time. A number system of 1 to 4 is usually used to describe how severe a pelvic organ prolapse is. For example, a 4 means a severe prolapse. You can ask your healthcare professional what this means for you, and any other questions you may have. ","In mild cases of prolapse, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes. For example, regular pelvic floor exercises and maintaining a healthy weight. Vaginal pessary A vaginal pessary is a device inserted into your vagina, which holds your vaginal walls in place and so pushes the prolapse back. Pessaries are usually made of latex (rubber) or silicone, and come in different shapes and sizes. A pessary might not be right for everyone. Your doctor will discuss with you to find out if it’s the best option, and you can ask any questions you may have. Some side effects can include: vaginal discharge irritation, bleeding or sores inside your vagina stress incontinence difficulty with bowel movements difficulty having sex (although most women can have sex without problems) an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in your vagina ",There are things you can do to reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse. Exercising your pelvic floor Do regular pelvic floor exercises to strength pelvic floor muscles maintain a healthy weight eat a high-fibre diet to avoid constipation or straining when you go to the toilet for a poo adopt good toilet habits avoid heavy lifting How to exercise your pelvic floor muscles 
Patau’s syndrome,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/chromosomal-conditions/pataus-syndrome/,"Patau’s syndrome, also known as Trisomy 13, is a rare but serious genetic condition. It begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and will continue to cause health problems throughout their life. In the UK, around 2 in every 10,000 births are affected by Patau’s syndrome. What is Patau’s syndrome? When a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome. Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father. If a baby has Patau’s syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby. There are 3 different forms of Patau’s syndrome: Full form In full form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells. Around 80% of babies born with Patau’s syndrome have the full form of the syndrome. Mosaic form In mosaic form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells. Partial form In partial form Patau’s syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 13. This is a very rare form of Patau’s syndrome. Why does Patau’s syndrome happen? Most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy. Effects of Patau’s syndrome on pregnancy Screening for Patau’s syndrome You’ll be offered screening for Patau’s syndrome when you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant. The screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Patau’s syndrome. If screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has Patau’s syndrome, you can choose to have a further diagnostic test if you wish. No test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Patau’s syndrome, or how they’ll be affected. Risk of miscarriage and stillbirth Around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Patau’s syndrome from screening tests will end in miscarriage or stillbirth . The risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth. Effects of Patau’s syndrome on babies If your baby is affected by Patau’s syndrome, it’s likely they will have some health conditions. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Patau’s syndrome they have. Babies with full form Patau’s syndrome Full form Patau’s syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live. Around 4 in 10 (43.1%) babies with full form Patau’s syndrome will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (9.7%) will live longer than 5 years. Babies born with full form Patau’s syndrome will have a learning disability that may be severe. They’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically: around 8 in 10 (80%) will have heart issues around 6 in 10 (60%) will have cleft lip and/or palate around 6 in 10 (60%) will have issues with brain development around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity) around 5 in 10 (50%) will have eye issues or an absent eye Babies with mosaic form and partial form Patau’s syndrome Currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau’s syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on: how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic) how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial) Some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Patau’s syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all. Most babies with a form of Patau’s syndrome will have some form of learning disability. The life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau’s syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy. Living with Patau’s syndrome Each child is unique, and Patau’s syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they will have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are. ",,,,"have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing) Despite their complex needs, children with Patau’s syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly. Many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school. Feedback from many parents suggests that children with Patau’s syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family. Congenital and rare condition register Babies with Patau’s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland. The register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information. It’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.

Penile cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/penile-cancer/,"Penile cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs on the skin of the penis or within the penis. Over the last 30 years, the number of penile cancer cases has increased by more than 20%, possibly due to changes in sexual practices. ","You should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including: a growth or sore on the penis that doesn’t heal within 4 weeks bleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin a foul-smelling discharge thickening of the skin of the penis or foreskin that makes it difficult to draw back the foreskin (phimosis) a change in the colour of the skin of the penis or foreskin a rash on the penis In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral .

","The cause of penile cancer isn’t known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it. genital warts . Age is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis. The condition rarely affects men and anyone with a penis under 40 years of age. It most commonly occurs in men and anyone with a penis aged over 60. Smoking is the most significant lifestyle factor associated with penile cancer. Chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your risk of getting the condition. Conditions that affect the penis, such as phimosis, which makes the foreskin difficult to retract, increase your chances of developing infections such as balanitis.

The type of penile cancer you have will depend on the type of cell the cancer developed from. The most common types of penile cancer include: squamous cell penile cancer – which accounts for more than 90% of cases and starts in the cells that cover the surface of the penis carcinoma in situ (CIS) – a particular type of squamous cell cancer where only the cells in the skin of the penis are affected and it hasn’t spread any deeper adenocarcinoma – cancer that starts in the glandular cells of the penis that produce sweat melanoma of the penis – where the cancer develops in the skin cells that give the skin its colour The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of penile cancer . surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy Surgery will involve removing the cancerous cells and possibly some of the surrounding tissue. In most cases, any physical changes to your penis after an operation can be corrected with reconstructive surgery.

One of the main ways you can reduce your chances of developing penile cancer is to give up smoking (if you smoke). It’s also important to maintain good penis hygiene to prevent the bacterial and viral infections that can increase the risk of penile cancer. This is easier if you were circumcised as a child, but there are steps you can take if you haven’t been circumcised. Simple penis hygiene can include: using condoms to help reduce the possibility of catching HPV regularly washing your penis with warm water, including under the foreskin There’s little evidence to suggest that being circumcised as an adult will reduce your chances of developing penile cancer. However, if you have sores that don’t heal, or if it’s becoming increasingly difficult to clean under your foreskin, seek advice from your GP about the possibility of circumcision. "

Seeing your GP Further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is. These can include: blood tests to determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition chest X-rays an ultrasound scan a computerised tomography (CT) scan a biopsy – a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testing Pleural effusion ,"Most cases are the result of a viral infection (such as the flu ) or a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia ). In rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or lung cancer . Pleurisy can affect people of all ages, but people of 65 years and over are most at risk, because they’re more likely to develop a chest infection . Read more about the . How is pleurisy treated? Pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura. It’s usually caused by another condition, such as an infection, but sometimes no cause can be identified. The pleura are two thin sheets of tissue that separate the lungs and ribcage. One is attached to the ribcage and the other is attached to the lungs. Between the pleural sheets is a thin layer of liquid that lubricates the pleura, helping to reduce friction when you breathe in and out. When there’s inflammation, the surfaces of the two layers can become rough and the fluid can become sticky. This can cause the layers to rub together, resulting in pain and discomfort. Infection An infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. Any type of infection has the potential to spread to the pleura, but viral infections are usually responsible. Viruses known to cause pleurisy include: the influenza (flu) virus glandular fever In some cases, pleurisy is caused by bacteria, such as: streptococcal bacteria – often associated with pneumonia , throat infections and some types of skin infections, such as impetigo and cellulitis staphylococcal bacteria – often associated with skin infections, food poisoning and, more seriously, blood poisoning (sepsis) Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause pleurisy, especially in hospital patients. MRSA is a type of bacteria with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics. injury – if the ribs are bruised or fractured, the pleura can become inflamed pulmonary embolism – a blood clot developing inside the lungs sickle cell anaemia – a blood disorder that usually affects people of African or Caribbean descent chemotherapy and radiotherapy HIV or AIDS lung cancer mesothelioma – a type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus Pleural effusion can result in shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. This is more likely in cases of pleurisy caused by pulmonary embolism or a bacterial infection. If pleural effusion doesn’t clear up as your pleurisy is treated, or if you’re very short of breath, a tube will need to be inserted so the fluid can be drained away. The tube may be inserted using either general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) or local anaesthetic (the area where the tube is inserted is numbed). If a lot of fluid has to be drained away, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. ",,"About pleurisy Pleurisy is inflammation of the sheet-like layers that cover the lungs (the pleura).

Post-polio syndrome,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/post-polio-syndrome/,Post-polio syndrome is a slow progressive condition that affects some people that have had polio . It’s not life threatening but it can cause problems in your ability to carry out daily activities. Polio is a serious viral infection that used to be common in the UK and worldwide. It’s rarer now because it can be prevented with vaccination. ,"muscle weakness shrinking of the muscles (atrophy) tight joints (contractures) pain in muscles or joints chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue swallowing and speech problems respiratory problems like breathlessness and sleep apnoea cramps and muscle twitching being sensitive to cold temperatures The muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. Sometimes it affects other muscles. This can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair. MRI scans can show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue. Although post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems like chest infections . Some people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia. During recovery from polio, surviving motor neurone cells grow new nerve ends to connect with other muscle fibres. This helps to regain muscle strength as someone recovers from the polio virus. Over time, these new nerve ends put the motor neurone cell under stress. The cells slowly break down, resulting in the loss of muscle strength. People who have had severe polio at a young age or during adolescence (teenage years) might be more likely to experience post-polio syndrome. People who had a more serious infection in early adulthood are also more likely to develop post-polio syndrome. Post-polio syndrome is not contagious. You might be offered blood tests and scans of your spine. Other tests that might be offered include: electromyography (EMG) tests – these will measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles and detect damage that may have been caused by having polio sleep studies – if you’re experiencing sleep apnoea or you’re feeling unusually tired tests to check your heart function and heart rate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan of your brain, spine and muscles lung function tests like a spirometry to measure your breathing test to investigate dysphagia (swallowing problems) It’s likely you’ll have a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working together to care for you including: neurologists respiratory specialists physiotherapists orthotists psychologists pain management specialists occupational therapists They’ll discuss the most suitable plan for your care which might include a mixture of the following: Exercise and rest Your healthcare team might suggest you try using pacing techniques. This might involve: prioritising tasks finding different ways of doing tasks which prevent pain or exhaustion getting help from others to do particularly exhausting tasks taking regular breaks and having rest periods regularly throughout your day doing some regular gentle exercise that you can gradually build up and stopping before you become exhausted Pacing can help you prevent becoming worn out. It can help to space out activities throughout the day to allow for rest periods where you can recover in between. Making effective and efficient use of your muscles and strength in this way can help them to last longer. Painkillers Medication to relieve pain might be used in addition to pacing techniques. Your healthcare team might suggest over the counter painkillers like aspirin, paracetamol or ibuprofen . Other stronger anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates might be considered too depending on individual needs. Talk to your GP if you’re taking over the counter medicines as they shouldn’t be used long term. They can cause complications like stomach ulcers if taken over a long period of time. Your healthcare team or GP might suggest medication like gabapentin or pregabalin for your pain if over the counter medications aren’t working. When taking medication for your pain, you might not feel the damage being caused to your muscles and joints through too much activity. This means it’s important you follow your pacing routine even when you don’t feel tired or aren’t in any pain. Mobility aids You might benefit from a mobility aid like: braces to support weakened muscles and joints, prevent falls and improve posture walking sticks to help you balance and prevent falls an electric scooter a wheelchair Your healthcare team will discuss the most suitable options for you depending on your needs. Many mobility aids are provided for free by the NHS. Your healthcare team can tell you about specific exercises suitable for you. Read our Eatwell Guide: How to eat a healthy balanced diet Coping with psychological factors Developing post-polio syndrome after living with the polio virus as a child can cause anxiety, isolation and stress. This can lead to depression . Speak to your GP if you’re feeling down and you no longer enjoy things you used to. ",Cases of polio in the UK fell dramatically when routine vaccination was introduced in the mid-1950s. Post-polio syndrome is caused by the polio virus. It only affects people who’ve had polio although it can take 15 – 40 years after the infection for it to develop. It’s not known if there’s anything that can be done to prevent it. The exact cause behind who’ll experience post-polio syndrome after having the polio virus is unclear. ,"It can be difficult to diagnose post-polio syndrome. There are no specific tests for it, and it can be mistaken for other conditions. Your GP might suspect post-polio syndrome if: ","You might be offered a machine to deliver pressurised air into your lungs through a mask during sleep. This is to help stop your airways closing if you have sleep apnoea . There are exercises you can do to increase the strength of your breathing muscles. A respiratory physiotherapist will help you to find suitable and safe exercises for you. Your healthcare team might suggest you have the pneumococcal vaccination , COVID-19 vaccines and annual flu jab . This is to reduce your risk of getting chest infections which can cause further complications. If you smoke, stopping smoking can help improve your breathing too. Healthy eating and weight control If you’re overweight, you might be putting your weakened muscles under further pressure. This can cause problems with your energy levels and overall health. ",
Pressure ulcers,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/pressure-ulcers/,About pressure ulcers ,". How pressure ulcers develop Pressure ulcers can develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time. The extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. Pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially those confined to lying in a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time. Conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes , can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. Learn more about the The parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair. For example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your: shoulders or shoulder blades elbows back of your head rims of your ears knees, ankles, heels or toes spine tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine) If you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on: your buttocks the back of your arms and legs the back of your hip bone Severity of pressure ulcers Healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue. Grade 1 A grade 1 pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured – it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1 pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard. Grade 2 In grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister. Grade 3 In grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound. Grade 4 A grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged. People with grade 4 pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection. your mental health whether you have had pressure ulcers in the past whether you have urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence your diet how well your blood circulation system is working As part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests. Blood tests can be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition. Urine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a urinary tract infection , which can be a cause for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage. Self-assessment If you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly check for early signs of the condition. Look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. Use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. Contact your GP or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage. Read more information about cellulitis . Left untreated, there is a risk that the infection can spread to the blood (see below) or the underlying bone or joint. In rare cases, where pressure ulcers involve the lower back, tail bone and spine, the pressure ulcer can spread to the membranes that surround the spine and brain. This is known as meningitis . Blood poisoning If a person with a weak immune system has a pressure ulcer that becomes infected, there is a risk that the infection will spread into their blood and other organs. This is known as blood poisoning or septicaemia. In the most serious cases of blood poisoning, damage to multiple organs can lead to a large drop in blood pressure, known as septic shock ","Diagnosing pressure ulcers . Who is affected? It’s estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least 1 pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition – for example, around 1 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer. People over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin. Pressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body. This pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. Blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. Without a constant blood supply, tissue is damaged and will eventually die. The lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. Once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria. People with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body. For example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night. Pressure ulcers can be caused by: pressure from a hard surface – such as a bed or wheelchair pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements – such as muscle spasms moisture – which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) The time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on: the amount of pressure how vulnerable a person’s skin is to damage Grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers can develop quickly. For example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1 or 2 hours. However, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred. Increased risk There are several factors that increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. These include: mobility problems – anything that affects your ability to move some or all of your body poor nutrition – for your skin to remain healthy, it requires nutrients that can only be supplied by eating a nutritious diet an underlying health condition that disrupts your blood supply or makes your skin more vulnerable to injury and damage being over 70 years old urinary incontinence and/or bowel incontinence serious mental health conditions These are discussed in more detail below. Mobility problems Possible reasons for having a mobility problem are: brain damage caused by an event such as a stroke or severe head injury , which results in paralysis having a condition that is causing progressive damage to the nerves your body uses to move parts of the body – such as Alzheimer’s disease , multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson’s disease having severe pain that makes it difficult to move some or all of your body having a fractured or broken bone recovering from the effects of surgery being in a coma having a condition that makes it difficult to move your joints and bones – such as rheumatoid arthritis Poor nutrition Reasons that your diet may lack nutrition include: anorexia nervosa – a mental health condition where a person has an unhealthy obsession with maintaining a low body weight dehydration – you do not have enough fluids in your body dysphagia – difficulty swallowing food Health conditions Health conditions that can make you more vulnerable to pressure ulcers include: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes – the high levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes can disrupt normal blood flow peripheral arterial disease (PAD) – blood supply in the legs becomes restricted due to a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries heart failure – previous damage to the heart means it is no longer able to pump enough blood around the body kidney failure – the kidney loses most or all of its functions, which can lead to a build-up of dangerous toxins (poisons) in the blood that can cause tissue damage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a collection of lung diseases; the low levels of oxygen in the blood associated with COPD can make the skin more vulnerable to damage Ageing skin There are several reasons why ageing skin is more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. These include: with age, the skin loses some of its elasticity (stretchiness), which makes it more vulnerable to damage reduced blood flow to the skin, due to the effects of ageing the amount of fat under the skin tends to decrease as people get older Incontinence Both urinary incontinence (inability to control your bladder) and bowel incontinence (inability to control your bowels) can cause certain areas of the skin to become moist and vulnerable to infection. This can cause pressure ulcers to form. Mental health conditions People with severe mental health conditions such as schizophrenia (a condition where people have problems telling the difference between reality and imagination) or severe depression have an increased risk of pressure ulcers for a number of reasons. These include: their diet tends to be poor they often have other physical health conditions, such as diabetes or incontinence they may neglect their personal hygiene, making their skin more vulnerable to injury and infection Diagnosing pressure ulcers Pressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. However, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it’s important to assess a person’s risk of developing them. As part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered: your general health your ability to move whether you have any problems that may affect your posture ",,"Complications of pressure ulcers Preventing pressure ulcers About pressure ulcers Pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. They are sometimes known as “bedsores” or “pressure sores”. Pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle. Read more about the For some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. For others, they can be serious and lead to life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning or gangrene. Read more about the complications of pressure ulcers . Pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. Therefore, a range of techniques is used to prevent them developing in the first place. These include: regularly changing a person’s position using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body – such as specially designed mattresses and cushions Read about and preventing pressure ulcers for more information. Unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it’s not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people. Your care team Pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. Therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. This type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT may include: Pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. There is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including: infection tissue death of the implanted flap muscle weakness blisters (small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin) recurrence of the pressure ulcers blood poisoning infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) internal bleeding abscesses (painful collections of pus that develop inside the body) deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg) Despite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning and gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue). Complications of pressure ulcers Even with the best possible medical care, complications can arise from grade 3 or grade 4 pressure ulcers and can occasionally be life-threatening. These complications are discussed below. Cellulitis Read more information about blood poisoning . Bone and joint infection Infection can also spread from a pressure ulcer into underlying joints (septic arthritis) and bones (osteomyelitis). Both of these infections can damage the cartilage, tissue and bone. They may also affect the joints and limbs. Antibiotics are required to treat bone and joint infections. In the most serious of cases, infected bones and joints may need to be surgically removed. Necrotising fasciitis Gas gangrene Preventing pressure ulcers However, you may find that the general advice outlined below is helpful. Changing position Making regular and frequent changes to your position is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. If a pressure ulcer has already developed, regularly changing position will help to avoid putting further pressure on it, and give the wound the best chance of healing. As a general rule, wheelchair users will need to change their position at least once every 15 to 30 minutes. People who are confined to bed will need to change their position at least once every 2 hours. Once you have developed a pressure ulcer, it’s important that you minimise or avoid putting any further pressure on it to give the wound the best chance of healing. If you are unable to change position yourself, a carer or relative will need to assist you. For more information and advice about positional changes, read about . Nutrition Eating a healthy, balanced diet that contains an adequate amount of protein and a good variety of vitamins and minerals can help prevent skin damage and speed up the healing process. You may be referred to a dietitian so that a dietary plan can be drawn up for you. If you currently have a reduced appetite due to a pre-existing health condition, the following advice may be useful: Try eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 2 or 3 larger meals. Set a timetable for when you should eat, rather than waiting until you feel hungry. This should ensure that you receive the necessary nutrition. Avoid drinking large amounts of fluids just before you are about to eat, as this will make you feel fuller than you actually are. If you find swallowing difficult, try drinking specially made nutritional drinks or puréed foods and soups. If you are a vegetarian, it’s important to eat high-protein alternatives to meat. Cheese, yoghurt, peanut butter, custard, beans and nuts are all good sources of protein. Read more information about healthy eating for more advice. Checking your skin If you have known risk factors for pressure ulcers, it’s important that you check your skin on a daily basis for any signs of pressure ulcers, such as discoloured areas of skin. This is particularly important if you have an underlying condition, such as nerve damage or diabetes, which may dampen or numb feelings of pain in certain parts of your body. You can use a mirror to check the parts of your body that are difficult to see, such as your bottom and the heels of your feet. If you notice any damage, report it to your care team. If you are at home, contact your GP or community nurse. If you are in hospital or a nursing home, inform one of your nurses or carers. Quit smoking If you are a smoker, giving up is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. Smoking reduces the levels of oxygen in your blood. It also weakens your immune system, which increases your risk of developing pressure ulcers. Read about quitting smoking for further information and advice about giving up smoking. ","a social worker a physiotherpist an occupational therapist a dietitian medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management Changing position It’s important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. Moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on the ulcers that have developed. After your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a “repositioning timetable”, which states how often you need to be moved. For some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. Others may need to be moved only once every 2 hours. The risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible. You may also be given training and advice about: correct sitting and lying positions how you can adjust your sitting and lying position how often you need to move or be moved how best to support your feet how to maintain good posture the special equipment you should use and how to use it Mattresses and cushions There are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. Your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you. Those thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1 or 2 pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body. People with a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. For example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required. Dressings Specially designed dressings and bandages can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. Examples of these types of dressings include: hydrocolloid dressings – these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry alginate dressings – these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process Creams and ointments Topical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage. Antibiotics If you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. These are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading. Antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present. Nutrition Certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin C, have been shown to accelerate wound healing. If your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. As a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you. Debridement In some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. This procedure is known as debridement. If there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. Larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. Some mechanical debridement techniques include: cleansing and pressure irrigation – where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets ultrasound – dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves laser – dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light surgical debridement – dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps A local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort. Maggot therapy Maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. Maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. They also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process. During maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. After a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed. Many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement. Surgery It’s not always possible for a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer to heal. In such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring. "
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/non-hodgkin-lymphoma-children/,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It’s more common in boys than girls. ,"How it’s diagnosed A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory ( biopsy ). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve. Staging ",,,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming and there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease. This is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. The lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you’re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin. The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50 nodes. Cancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. There are 2 main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) There are 2 main types of NHL. B-cell NHL usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. T-cell NHL usually affects lymph nodes in the chest. Occasionally, NHL can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. This is called extranodal lymphoma. Stage 1 One group of lymph nodes is affected, or there’s a single extranodal tumour. Stage 2 Two or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing). Stage 3 There’s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest. Stage 4 The lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system. Chemotherapy NHL can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. To stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy. Very rarely, radiotherapy is also necessary. Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting a sore mouth temporary hair loss a low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed) tiredness diarrhoea Late side effects Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Pneumonia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/,About pneumonia ,"a cough – which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm) difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting rapid heartbeat fever feeling generally unwell sweating and shivering loss of appetite chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing coughing up blood (haemoptysis) headaches fatigue nausea or vomiting wheezing joint and muscle pain feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people When to see your GP Who’s affected? In the UK, pneumonia affects around 8 in 1,000 adults each year. It’s more widespread in autumn and winter. Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it’s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. common cold , bronchitis and asthma . However, how quickly they improve will depend on how severe your pneumonia is. As a general guide, after: one week – fever should have resolved four weeks – chest pain and mucus production should have substantially reduced six weeks – cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced six months – most people will feel back to normal antibiotics . the bacteria causing the infection is resistant to antibiotics – your GP may prescribe a different antibiotic, or they may prescribe a second antibiotic for you to take with the first one a virus is causing the infection, rather than bacteria – antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and your body’s immune system will have to fight the viral infection by creating antibodies Painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen , may help relieve pain and reduce fever. However, you shouldn’t take ibuprofen if you: are allergic to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have asthma , kidney disease, a history of stomach ulcers or indigestion Cough medicines aren’t recommended as there’s also little evidence they are effective. A warm honey and lemon drink can help relieve discomfort caused by coughing. Your cough may persist for two to three weeks after you finish your course of antibiotics, and you may feel tired for even longer as your body continues to recover. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration , and get plenty of rest to help your body recover. If you smoke, it’s more important than ever to stop, as smoking damages your lungs. Read more about you smoke you’re over the age of 50 Some people may be advised to have a flu vaccination or pneumococcal vaccination after recovering from pneumonia. Read more about preventing pneumonia . In very serious cases of pneumonia, breathing assistance through a ventilator in an intensive care unit (ICU) may be required. Read more about the complications of pneumonia . ","Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi. As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include: viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia Risk groups The following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia: babies and very young children elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such as asthma , cystic fibrosis , or a heart, kidney or liver condition people with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as flu , having HIV or AIDS , having chemotherapy , or taking medication following an organ transplant Diagnosing pneumonia ","whether you feel breathless or you’re breathing faster than usual how long you’ve had your cough, and whether you’re coughing up mucus and what colour it is if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out Your GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds. They may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs. If you have mild pneumonia, you probably won’t need to have a chest X-ray or any other tests. You may need a chest X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests ","About pneumonia Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It’s usually caused by a bacterial infection. At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid. Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest taking antibiotics drinking plenty of fluids As pneumonia isn’t usually passed from one person to another, it’s safe to be around others, including family members. However, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better. For at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital. This is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person’s health and age. Read more about . Complications of pneumonia Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes . Possible complications of pneumonia include: pleurisy – where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure a lung abscess – a rare complication that’s mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse blood poisoning (septicaemia) – also a rare but serious complication Preventing pneumonia Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren’t passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading. For example, you should: cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze throw away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects A healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection. Find out how to stop smoking . Excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs’ natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia. People at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine. Unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise, you should always finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. and how to stop smoking . See your GP if, after following the above self-help measures, your condition is deteriorating or isn’t improving as expected. Pneumonia isn’t usually passed from one person to another, so it’s safe to be around others, including family members. However, it’s best for people with a weakened immune system to avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/,,"If you have OCD, you should not feel ashamed or embarrassed. Like diabetes or asthma , it’s a long-term health condition, and it’s not your fault you have it. Your GP will probably ask you a series of questions to see if it’s likely you have OCD. ","This pattern has 4 main steps: Obsession – where an intrusive, distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind. Anxiety – the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress. Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel you have to do as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession. Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief, but the obsession and anxiety return, causing the cycle to begin again. Obsessive thoughts Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images. Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance. If you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession. Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include: fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way Compulsive behaviour Compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all. For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD. Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion. Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people. Related problems Some people with OCD may also have or develop other mental health problems, including: depression eating disorders generalised anxiety disorder a hoarding disorder People with OCD and severe depression might also have suicidal feelings. The exact cause of OCD is not known. There are some factors that could make a person more likely to have OCD. These factors might include: genetics life events personality traits chemical differences in the brain Diagnosing OCD ",Speak to your GP if: you think you might have OCD ,"If you think someone you know may have OCD, it’s a good idea to: talk to them carefully about your concerns suggest they speak to their GP cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) medication If your OCD has a severe impact on your daily life, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist mental health service. Here you’ll likely receive a combination of intensive CBT and a course of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . OCD Action have online support groups where you can connect with other people with similar experiences. ",
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/,Introduction ,"Read more about the . Read more about complex PTSD . When to seek medical advice It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks. Psychotherapy – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Antidepressants – such as paroxetine or mirtazapine. Read more about Re-experiencing Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of: flashbacks nightmares repetitive and distressing images or sensations physical sensations – such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling Some people have constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event. For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame. Avoidance and emotional numbing Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience. Many people with PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies. Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy. Hyperarousal (feeling ‘on edge’) Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state of mind is known as hyperarousal. Hyperarousal often leads to: irritability angry outbursts sleeping problems ( insomnia ) difficulty concentrating Other problems Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including: other mental health problems – such as depression , anxiety or phobias self-harming or destructive behaviour – such as drug misuse or alcohol misuse headaches , dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships. PTSD in children stomach aches . bedwetting being unusually anxious about being separated from a parent or other adult re-enacting the traumatic event(s) through their play When to seek medical advice It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks. For example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you’re better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being “on edge” (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis. However, while these responses may be intended to help you survive, they’re actually very unhelpful in reality because you can’t process and move on from the traumatic experience. Adrenaline levels Studies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones. Normally, when in danger, the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction, often known as the “fight or flight” reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain. People with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there’s no danger. It’s thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD. Changes in the brain In people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans. One part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It’s thought that changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks. The malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn’t reduce over time. There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as: a psychologist – an expert in how the mind works a community psychiatric nurse – a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare a psychiatrist – a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions Watchful waiting If watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month. Psychotherapy It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist’s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. Other methods may include the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone. It’s not clear exactly how EMDR works but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience. Group therapy There are also a number of charities which provide counselling and support groups for PTSD. For example: Combat Stress – a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women Rape Crisis – a charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault Victim Support – providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime CRUSE – a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced bereavement Medication Antidepressants such as paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine are sometimes used to treat PTSD in adults. For example, common side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea. Children and young people For children and young people with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended. Adults with complex PTSD may lose their trust in people and feel separated from others. but may include: feelings of shame or guilt difficulty controlling your emotions periods of losing attention and concentration – this is known as dissociation cutting yourself off from friends and family relationship difficulties destructive or risky behaviour – such as self-harm, alcohol misuse or drug abuse suicidal thoughts finding friends getting a job regular exercise taking on hobbies It’s important to try and develop some feelings of trust. It may take some time, but a trusting relationship with a therapist will help treat complex PTSD.

PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide ","The type of events that can cause PTSD include: serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur weeks, months or even years later. PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it’s not clear exactly why some people develop the condition and others don’t. Read more about the . Complex PTSD People who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex PTSD. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience. Types of events that can lead to PTSD include: serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis Although it’s not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. These are described below. Survival mechanism ","an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member or friend PTSD isn’t usually related to situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams. PTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It isn’t fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don’t. However, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD. If you’ve had depression or anxiety in the past, or you don’t receive much support from family or friends, you’re more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event. There may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition. ","Complex PTSD Self-help guide Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. How PTSD is treated PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. . for more information. It’s possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it’s never too late to seek help. Assessment psychotherapy is usually recommended first. A combination of psychotherapy and medication may be recommended if you have severe or persistent PTSD. Psychotherapy is a type of therapy often used to treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression , anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder . The main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with PTSD are described below. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act. For example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. During this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you feel, while identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience. Your therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. For example, feeling you’re to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again. You may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you’ve avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident. You’ll usually have 8-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) However, these medications will only be used if: Amitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist. Complex PTSD Complex PTSD may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events, such as violence, neglect or abuse. Complex PTSD is thought to be more severe if: the traumatic events happened early in life the trauma was caused by a parent or carer the person experienced the trauma for a long time the person was alone during the trauma there is still contact with the person responsible for the trauma Stabilisation Certain techniques, known as ‘grounding’ techniques, may be able to help you separate an abusive or traumatic past from the present. The aim is to make the past seem less frightening and reduce the amount of flashbacks you experience. With time, you can begin to experience less anxiety and learn to cope with daily life. Trauma-focused therapy Trauma-focused therapy may include: certain types of psychotherapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) Reintegration The final stage is to begin to use these skills and techniques to develop better relationships with other people. Medication, such as antidepressants , may still be recommended if psychotherapy isn’t possible or you feel unsafe.

Rare tumours,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/rare-tumours/,,,,,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Types of rare cancers in children Rare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as: rare cancers that only affect children, such as pancreatoblastoma, malignant rhabdoid tumours and melanotic neuroectodermal tumours of infancy cancers that usually only affect adults, such as cancers of the digestive system, the thyroid and the adrenal gland rare cancers in the head and neck area, such as nasopharyngeal cancer rare hormonal/endocrine cancers, such as phaeochromocytoma rare brain tumours, such as meningioma rare skin cancers, such as melanomas Surgery Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be used to treat any cancer cells that may be left behind after surgery, or to shrink a cancer. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. Chemotherapy may be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back or to treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Research Clinical trials are usually not available as the number of children with rare cancers is so small. The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Postnatal depression,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/,"Postnatal depression is a type of depression. Many parents experience it after having a baby. It’s a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 mothers within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common. With the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most people make a full recovery. ","Postnatal depression affects everyone differently. It can start at any point in the first year after giving birth. It can continue from depression in pregnancy. It may develop suddenly or gradually. Many people feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the ‘baby blues’ and is so common that it’s considered normal. The baby blues don’t last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth. a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood loss of interest in the world around you no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure lack of energy and feeling tired all the time trouble sleeping at night feeling sleepy during the day feeling that you’re unable to look after your baby problems concentrating and making decisions loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating) feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ‘can’t be bothered’) feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame difficulty bonding with your baby – feeling of indifference and no sense of enjoyment in their company frightening thoughts, for example, about hurting your baby – these can be scary, but they’re very rarely acted upon thinking about suicide and self-harm Speak to your GP or health visitor as soon as possible if: you think you have postnatal depression Don’t struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away. It can take a lot longer to feel better if it’s not addressed. Spotting the signs of postnatal depression Postnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they’re feeling. This may be because they worry they’ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy. Signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include: frequently crying for no obvious reason having difficulty bonding with their baby getting no pleasure from playing with them or feeling no good as a parent withdrawing from contact with other people speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they’re hopeless neglecting themselves, like not washing or changing their clothes losing all sense of time, like being unaware whether 10 minutes or 2 hours have passed losing their sense of humour constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance from others If you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings. This could be to talk to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor. It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting. low mood irritability lack of concentration sleeplessness This helps you to function normally and helps you cope better with your new baby. Antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt. This means it’s important to keep taking them even if you don’t notice an improvement straight away. You’ll usually need to take them for around 6 months after you begin to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return. If you’re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines. Some types of antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding. Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants. You should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby. Self-help Do talk to your partner, friends and family to help them understand how you’re feeling talk to your loved ones about what they can do to support you accept help from others when it’s offered ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks like housework, cooking and shopping make time for yourself – try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable rest when you can – although it can be difficult when you’re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance follow good sleeping habits ask your partner to help with the night-time work exercise regularly – this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression eat regular, healthy meals Don’t do not go for long periods without eating do not drink alcohol or take drugs, as this can make you feel worse Support groups Ask your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other people who are going through something similar. Find postnatal depression support and information in your area ","The cause of postnatal depression isn’t completely clear. Some of the factors it has been associated with include: a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life or during pregnancy having no close family or friends to support you a poor relationship with your partner recent stressful life events, like a bereavement experiencing the ‘baby blues’ ",,"Your GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For example, you may be anaemic after giving birth. This could add to any feelings of depression you might have. Guided self-help Guided self-help involves working through a book or an online course. You can do this on your own or with some help from a therapist. It focusses on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them. The courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy. It’s based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour. CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way. Interpersonal therapy Interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you’re experiencing. It aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners. It then looks at how they might relate to your feelings of depression. Antidepressants Antidepressants may be recommended if: you have moderate or severe depression you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression You might be referred to a specialist perinatal mental health team if your depression: is very severe more intensive CBT psychotherapy therapies such as baby massage which can improve depression and help build your relationships with your baby different medications electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through the brain For a small number of people, coming into hospital can help speed up recovery.

Prostate cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/prostate-cancer/,About prostate cancer ,"When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied. prostate enlargement ). Read more about the What is the prostate? The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it’s located between the penis and the bladder and surrounds the urethra. The main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen. Why does prostate cancer happen? Nevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night needing to rush to the toilet difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy) straining or taking a long time while urinating weak flow feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully Your prostate may get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: There is no single, definitive test for prostate cancer, so your GP will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety. Your doctor is likely to: ask for a urine sample to check for infection take a blood sample to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) examine your prostate ( digital rectal examination ) In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . PSA testing PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. All men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of PSA in their blood, and it increases with age. Prostate cancer can increase the production of PSA, and so a PSA test looks for raised levels of PSA in the blood that may be a sign of the condition in its early stages. However, PSA testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. Most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised PSA level. Most people with a raised PSA level will not have cancer, as PSA levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older. Read more about PSA screening for prostate cancer Digital rectal examination (DRE) The next step is a DRE, which can be done by your GP. During a DRE, your GP will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. The rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your GP can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. This will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful. Watchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if: Active surveillance Radiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. It is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. There are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy. Hormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. In particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. The purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone. Hormone therapy can be given as: injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists Read further information: Cancer Research UK: hormone therapy for prostate cancer Trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) During TURP, a thin metal wire with a loop at the end is inserted into your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed. This is carried out under general anaesthetic or a spinal anaesthetic (epidural). Read more information about transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) HIFU is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate. An ultrasound probe inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. These sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature. The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. They include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you. Steroids Steroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. This is called hormone-refractory cancer. anxious or depressed , and affect your sleep. Whatever stage your prostate cancer has reached, try to give yourself time to do the things you enjoy and spend time with those who care about you. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: coping with prostate cancer Complications of prostate cancer Erection problems If you have erectile dysfunction , speak to your GP. It may be possible to treat you with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis. The most commonly used PDE5 is sildenafil (Viagra). Other PDE5s are available if sildenafil is not effective. ","Diagnosing prostate cancer Testing for prostate cancer The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older. For reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean African descent. It’s less common in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent. Men and anyone with a prostate who have first-degree male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk. Read more about the Tests for prostate cancer There is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you. The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests , a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE ) and a biopsy . The blood test, known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable. These include: age – risk rises as you get older and most cases are diagnosed in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean and African descent than in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer obesity – there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer exercise – men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer In addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. However, more research is needed. Read further information: Prostate Cancer UK: who is at risk of prostate cancer Cancer Research UK: Diagnosing prostate cancer DRE is useful in ruling out prostate enlargement Biopsy Your GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels, the results of your DRE, and your age, family history and ethnic group. If you are at risk, you should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests. The most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS). A biopsy may also be taken during a cystoscopy examination or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum). During a TRUS biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate. The procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a local anaesthetic to minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection. Although it is more reliable than a PSA test, the TRUS biopsy can have problems. It can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. The doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present. erectile dysfunction . Urinary incontinence If your urinary incontinence is mild, you may be able to control it by learning some simple exercises. Pelvic floor exercises can strengthen your control over your bladder. To carry out pelvic floor exercises: Sit or lie comfortably with your knees slightly apart. Squeeze or lift at the front as if you were trying to stop the passage of urine, then squeeze or lift at the back as if you were trying to stop the passage of wind. Hold this contraction for as long as you can (at least 2 seconds, increasing up to 10 as you improve). Relax for the same amount of time before repeating. If your urinary incontinence is more severe, it may be possible to treat it with surgery. This would involve implanting an artificial sphincter – a sphincter is a muscle used to control the bladder.

These include: a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT) scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body an isotope bone scan – this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones; a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalities Read further information: Cancer Research UK: prostate cancer tests Testing for prostate cancer There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. This is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks. PSA screening Routinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. There are several reasons for this: PSA tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) – this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason More research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm. One European study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of: Improving the test As there are many reasons why PSA levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the PSA test, or a variation of it, more accurate. This includes looking at how PSA levels change over time and comparing the PSA level to prostate size. Researchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as MRI scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated PSA should have a biopsy. Instead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their GP about PSA testing. It aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a PSA test. If you’re aged 50 or over with a prostate and decide to have your PSA levels tested after talking to your GP, they will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the NHS. If results show you have a raised level of PSA, your GP may suggest further tests. Should I have a PSA test? Because the results of the PSA test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer. If you are thinking about asking for a PSA test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you with your GP so you understand what the results might mean. The Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme has information on the risks and benefits of the PSA test to help you decide whether or not to have it. Staging of prostate cancer A widely used method of staging is a number staging system. The stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland stage 2 – the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger stage 3 – the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage If prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: the stages of prostate cancer Watchful waiting Watchful waiting is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer will affect your natural life span. your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it Radical prostatectomy Like any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects: some people have problems with urinary incontinence – t his can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation some men have problems getting an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) – t his sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems in extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal For many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. However, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation. Radiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery. After a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. This means that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. You may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Read further information: Macmillan: surgery for early prostate cancer Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Short-term effects of radiotherapy can include: discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body) diarrhoea loss of pubic hair tiredness cystitis – an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful Possible long-term side effects can include: an inability to obtain an erection urinary incontinence back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort) As with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. In these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. This is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy. Read further information: Macmillan: radiotherapy for early prostate cancer Brachytherapy Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy. The radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. This is called low dose-rate brachytherapy. The radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. This is called high dose-rate brachytherapy. This method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. However, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer Hormone therapy erectile dysfunction (this is more common with LHRH agonists than anti-androgens). Other possible side effects include: hot flushes sweating weight gain swelling and tenderness of the breasts However, possible effects can include impotence (in 5 to 10 in every 100) or urinary incontinence (in less than 1 in every 100). Back passage problems are rare.

It is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland. Tiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. They freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die. The aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. The side effects of cryotherapy can include: erectile dysfunction – this can affect between 2 and 9 in every 10 incontinence – this affects less than 1 in 20 It is rare for cryotherapy to cause rectal problems or fistulas. radiotherapy chemotherapy If the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. Bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy. There are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. Your medical team can tell you if these are suitable and available for you. NICE has recently issued guidance on medications called abiraterone and enzalutamide.

Psychosis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/psychosis/,Introduction ,"are: hallucinations – where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren’t there; a common hallucination is hearing voices delusions – where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue – for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour. bipolar disorder – a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of depression (lows) and mania (highs) Psychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease , a brain tumour , or as a result of drug misuse or alcohol misuse . How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause. For example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur.

People with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of suicide . It’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves. Side effects can also occur if someone is taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases, a person with psychosis may also develop type 2 diabetes . Read more about the complications of psychosis . hallucinations delusions confused and disturbed thoughts lack of insight and self-awareness These are outlined in more detail below. Hallucinations Hallucinations are where a person perceives something that doesn’t exist in reality. They can occur in all five of the senses: sight – someone with psychosis may see colours and shapes, or people or animals that aren’t there sounds – someone with psychosis may hear voices that are angry, unpleasant or sarcastic touch – a common psychotic hallucination is that you are being touched when there is nobody there smell – usually a strange or unpleasant odour taste – some people with psychosis have complained of having a constant unpleasant taste in their mouth Delusions A delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something implausible, bizarre, or obviously untrue. Paranoid delusion and delusions of grandeur are two examples of psychotic delusions. A person with psychosis will often believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. This can lead to unusual behaviour. For example, a person with psychosis may refuse to be in the same room as a mobile phone because they believe they are mind control devices. Someone with psychosis may also have delusions of grandeur. This is where they believe they have some imaginary power or authority. For example, they may think they’re the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead. Confused and disturbed thoughts People with psychosis often have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. Signs of this include: rapid and constant speech random speech – for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence a sudden loss in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activity Lack of insight People who have psychotic episodes are often totally unaware their behaviour is in any way strange or that their delusions or hallucinations are not real. They may recognise delusional or bizarre behaviour in others, but lack the self-awareness to recognise it in themselves. For example, a person with psychosis being treated in a psychiatric ward may complain that their fellow patients are mentally unwell, while they’re perfectly normal. Postnatal psychosis Postnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form of postnatal depression , a type of depression some women experience after having a baby. It’s estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. It most commonly occurs during the first few weeks after having a baby. Postnatal psychosis is more likely to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia . a high mood (mania) – for example, talking and thinking too much or too quickly a low mood – for example, depression , lack of energy, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping Postnatal psychosis is regarded as a medical emergency. Contact your GP immediately if you think someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis. If this isn’t possible, call the NHS 24 ‘111’ service or your local out-of-hours service. If you think there’s an imminent danger of harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. . Grey matter Research has revealed several physical and biological changes occur in the brain during a psychotic episode. Grey matter is the part of the brain responsible for processing thoughts. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have shown some people with a history of psychosis have less grey matter than most other people. However, it’s not yet fully understood why this is. Dopamine Researchers also believe dopamine plays an important role in psychosis. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, one of many chemicals the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. It is associated with how we feel whether something is significant, important, or interesting. It’s thought levels of dopamine in the brain become too high in people with psychosis. The excess dopamine interrupts specific pathways in the brain that are responsible for some of its most important functions, such as: memory emotion social behaviour self-awareness However, illegal drugs known to increase levels of dopamine in the brain – such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines – can trigger psychosis. Your GP may ask questions to determine the cause of your psychosis. For example, they may ask you: whether you’re taking any medication whether you’ve been taking illegal substances how your moods have been – for example, whether you’ve been depressed how you’ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you’re still working whether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia about the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you’ve heard voices about the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you Referral prescriptions for medications psychological services social, occupational, and educational interventions Antipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. There are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need one injection every two to six weeks. Depending on the underlying cause of your psychosis, you may only need to take antipsychotics until your psychosis subsides. However, if you have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, you may need to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis to prevent further episodes of psychosis. Side effects Antipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person. Side effects can include: drowsiness – this may affect your ability to drive shaking and trembling restlessness muscle twitches and spasms – where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully blurred vision dizziness constipation loss of sex drive (libido) dry mouth See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. In addition, long-term use of antipsychotics can lead to complications like weight gain and diabetes . Read more about the complications of psychosis . Tell your GP if you have side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. There may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take. Never stop taking medication prescribed for you unless advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. However, stopping medication isn’t always safe and has to be balanced against the risk of having a relapse. In some cases, TD can be a permanent condition. clonazepam – a medication used to treat epilepsy ","The two main Psychosis isn’t a condition in itself – it’s triggered by other conditions. It’s sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: schizophrenia . Diagnosing psychosis They are psychosis caused by: mental (psychological) conditions general medical conditions substances, such as alcohol or drugs The three classifications are described in more detail below. The following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: schizophrenia bipolar disorder – a condition that affects a person’s moods, which can swing from one extreme to another (highs and lows) severe stress or anxiety severe depression – feelings of persistent sadness that last for more than six weeks, including postnatal depression , which some women experience after having a baby lack of sleep The underlying psychological cause will often influence the type of psychotic episode someone experiences. For example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have delusions of grandeur, whereas someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to develop paranoid delusions . General medical conditions The following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: HIV and AIDS – a virus that attacks the body’s natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system) malaria – a tropical disease spread by infected mosquitoes syphilis – a bacterial infection usually passed on through sexual contact Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease – a long-term condition that affects the way the brain co-ordinates body movements, including walking, talking, and writing hypoglycaemia – an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in the blood lupus – a condition where the immune system attacks healthy tissue Lyme disease – a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks multiple sclerosis – a condition that affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing problems with muscle movement, balance, and vision brain tumour – a growth of cells in the brain that multiply in an abnormal and uncontrollable way Substances Alcohol misuse and drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode. A person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking alcohol or taking drugs after using them for a long time. This is known as withdrawal. It’s also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you’re high on drugs. Drugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include: cocaine amphetamine (speed) methamphetamine (crystal meth) mephedrone (MCAT or miaow) MDMA (ecstasy) cannabis LSD (acid) psilocybins (magic mushrooms) ketamine In rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medication or as a result of an overdose of that medication. For example, levodopa, a medication used to treat Parkinson’s disease , can sometimes cause psychotic episodes. However, any medicine that acts on the brain can cause psychosis with an overdose. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. See your GP if you’re experiencing psychotic side effects caused by medication. The brain There’s been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can trigger People who have cardiovascular disease – conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such as heart disease – will also be closely monitored. vitamin E supplements – check with the doctor in charge of your care before taking vitamin supplements as they’re not safe or suitable for everyone ",You should visit your GP if you’re experiencing psychotic episodes. ,"Complications Introduction Read more about diagnosing psychosis . social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation . Getting help for others People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They’re unaware that they’re thinking and acting strangely. Because of their lack of insight, it’s often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them. Initial assessment Who you’re referred to will depend on the services available in your area. You may be referred to: a community mental health team – a team of different mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions a crisis resolution team – a team of different mental health professionals who treat people currently experiencing a psychotic episode who would otherwise require hospitalisation an early intervention team – a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis These teams are likely to include some or all of the following healthcare professionals: a community mental health nurse – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions . Helping others The lack of insight associated with psychosis means people experiencing it aren’t always able to recognise their strange behaviour. They may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there’s nothing wrong with them, and you may need to get help for them. Someone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a mental health worker, who works in social services, so try to contact them to express your concerns. Someone who is having a psychotic episode for the first time may need a friend, relative or someone else close to them to persuade them to visit their GP. If they’re having a psychotic episode that’s rapidly getting worse, you should contact their crisis team or, if the team isn’t available, the duty psychiatrist at their nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. If a person who is having a psychotic episode refuses to seek help and is believed to present a risk to themselves or others, their nearest relative can request a psychological assessment. Your local mental health trust can advise you about this. Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 . Your care team Early intervention teams An early intervention team is a team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis. Some early intervention teams only focus on a certain age range, such as people who are 14 to 35 years old. Depending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide: For example, psychotherapy called family therapy are also often used. Psychosis related to drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal may only require a short course of antipsychotics or tranquillisers, which have a calming effect. Referral to an addiction counsellor may then be recommended. Antipsychotics However, they’re not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. In particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also have epilepsy Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them. The aim of CBT is to identify unhelpful thinking patterns and emotions that may be causing your unwanted feelings and behaviours. It’s then possible to learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and balanced thoughts. A CBT therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what’s happening to you. The aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work or university, or regaining a sense of control. Family therapy After having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for care and support. While most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family. Family therapy involves a series of informal meetings that take place over a period of six months. Meetings may include: exploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis deciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as planning how to manage future psychotic episodes Self-help groups If you’re experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who’ve had similar experiences. Complications Someone experiencing a psychotic episode may self-harm. Suicidal thoughts and an increased risk of suicide are also common. Self-harm Self-harming behaviour is a relatively common complication in people with psychosis. A study found 1 in 10 people with psychosis also had a history of self-harm. See your GP if you’re self-harming. You can also call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 for support. If you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs of unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on the wrists, arms, thighs, and chest. People who self-harm may keep themselves covered up at all times, even in hot weather. A person who’s self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or they may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. It’s important to approach them with care and understanding. They may not want to discuss their self-harming behaviour with you, but you could suggest they speak to their GP or a counsellor on a support helpline. Suicide People with psychosis also have an increased risk of suicide . It’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves. If you’re feeling suicidal, you can: call the Samaritans support service on 08457 90 90 90 go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you’re feeling contact the NHS 24 ‘111’ service speak to a friend, family member, or someone you trust make an urgent appointment to see your GP, psychiatrist, or care team Read more about getting help if you’re feeling suicidal . If you’re worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, recommend that they contact one or more of the organisations above and encourage them, in a non-judgemental way, to talk about how they’re feeling. If the person has previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression , you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice. Read more about the warning signs of suicide and supporting someone who’s feeling suicidal . Antipsychotics Using antipsychotics on a medium- to long-term basis can cause a number of complications. Some of the more common complications are discussed below. Weight gain Weight gain is a complication of many commonly used antipsychotics. There are two main reasons why weight gain is thought to occur. Antipsychotics can: lead to an increase in appetite make you less active You’ll probably be advised to take more exercise to help burn off the excess fat. Read about getting started with exercise and how to lose weight safely . Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a term describing a number of related conditions linked to weight gain, such as: high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) high cholesterol high blood pressure (hypertension) obesity These health conditions can also increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes , heart disease and, most seriously, heart attack or stroke . Because of the risk of metabolic syndrome, you’ll usually need to have regular blood tests and blood pressure tests while taking antipsychotics. statins , are available to help lower cholesterol levels. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is another common complication of long-term antipsychotic use. TD is a movement disorder where a person experiences involuntary movements, such as twitching, tics, grimaces, tremors, and spasms. It usually starts in the face and mouth before spreading to the rest of the body. ",

Healthy eating and exercise People with psoriasis have a slightly higher risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease than the general population, although it’s not known why. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with psoriasis, because they can help to prevent many health problems. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly can also relieve stress, which may improve your psoriasis. Emotional impact of psoriasis Because of the effect that psoriasis can have on physical appearance, low self-esteem and anxiety are common among people with the condition. This can lead to depression , especially if the psoriasis gets worse. Your GP or dermatologist will understand the psychological and emotional impact of psoriasis, so talk to them about your concerns or anxieties. Psoriatic arthritis ","These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. Psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally. The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it’s just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a major impact on their quality of life. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Why it happens People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells. Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis. Although the process isn’t fully understood, it’s thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system is your body’s defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake. Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. . How psoriasis is diagnosed A GP can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin. In rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy , will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus , lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea. There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe. Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping. You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis. Psoriasis often occurs on the elbow area. Source: https://dermnetnz.org/ Common types of psoriasis Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) Nail psoriasis In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble. Guttate psoriasis This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers. Inverse (flexural) psoriasis This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather. Pustular psoriasis Generalised pustular psoriasis or von Zumbusch psoriasis Palmoplantar pustular psoriasis Acropustulosis Erythrodermic psoriasis Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration , heart failure , hypothermia and malnutrition . Psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It’s not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it’s caused by a problem with the immune system. Your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3 to 4 weeks. In people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3 to 7 days. As a result, cells that aren’t fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales. Problems with the immune system Your immune system is your body’s defence against disease and it helps fight infection. One of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a T-cell. Genetics Psoriasis runs in families. 1 in 3 people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition. However, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. It’s likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop it. Psoriasis triggers There’s no single test for psoriatic arthritis. It’s normally diagnosed using a combination of methods, including looking at your medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays and MRI scans. If you have psoriasis, you’ll usually have an annual assessment to look for signs of psoriatic arthritis. If your doctor thinks you have psoriatic arthritis, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist, so you can be treated with anti-inflammatory or anti-rheumatic medicines. Pregnancy Psoriasis doesn’t affect fertility, and women with psoriasis can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. Some women find their psoriasis improves during pregnancy, but for others it gets worse. ","If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken. ","Living with psoriasis About psoriasis topical corticosteroids Read more about . Living with psoriasis Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected. For example, some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It’s also quite common to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.

Further information You can find support and information from organisations like: Changing Faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice The Psoriasis Association – provides support groups for people with psoriasis where you can speak to other people with the condition topical – creams and ointments that are applied to your skin phototherapy – your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet light systemic– oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body If you have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended. Emollients Emollients are available as a wide variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor. Steroid creams or ointments Steroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids) Topical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. Only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. Stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of skin or on particularly thick patches. Overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning. Vitamin D analogues Vitamin D analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of steroid creams for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. They work by slowing the production of skin cells. They also have an anti-inflammatory effect. Examples of vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. There are very few side effects, as long as you don’t use more than the recommended amount. Calcineurin inhibitors Calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. They’re sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if steroid creams aren’t effective. These medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they’re started, but this usually improves within a week. Coal tar Coal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. It can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below). Dithranol Dithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. However, it can burn if too concentrated. Dithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below). Phototherapy UVB phototherapy Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) Combination light therapy Non-biological medications Methotrexate Methotrexate can help to control psoriasis by slowing down the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It’s usually taken once a week. Methotrexate can cause nausea and may affect the production of blood cells. Long-term use can cause liver damage. People who have liver disease shouldn’t take methotrexate, and you shouldn’t drink alcohol when taking it. Ciclosporin Ciclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored. Acitretin Acitretin has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages and, in rarer cases, hepatitis . Acitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2 years after they stop taking it. However, it’s safe for a man taking acitretin to father a baby. Etanercept The main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. However, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. If you had tuberculosis Adalimumab Infliximab Ustekinumab Living with psoriasis Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected. If you have psoriasis, you may find the following advice helpful. Self care Self care is an essential part of your daily life. It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. Self care includes staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health, preventing illness or accidents, and caring more effectively for minor illnesses and long-term conditions. People with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from self care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Having a care plan Regular reviews Talk to others Many people with psoriasis have found that getting involved in support groups helps them. Support groups can increase your self-confidence, reduce feelings of isolation, and give you practical advice about living with the condition.

Psoriatic arthritis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/psoriatic-arthritis/,About psoriatic arthritis About psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that develops in some people with the skin condition psoriasis ,"Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. It’s not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don’t. The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects particular areas including the hands feet knees elbows neck and spine Tendons can also be involved – in some people they may be the major problem. Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they happen. When to seek medical advice You should speak to your GP if you experience constant pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints – even if you haven’t been diagnosed with psoriasis. If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any problems with your joints. Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis – such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis – have been ruled out. For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible. The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Your GP may first prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways: traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen , naproxen or diclofenac COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib If side-effects do happen, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include indigestion and stomach ulcers . A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs. If NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended. Steroid medication (corticosteroids) Like NSAIDs, corticosteroids can help reduce pain and swelling. If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months. Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help when lots of joints are inflamed. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Psoriatic arthritis can be treated with a variety of DMARDs including: Methotrexate Sulphasalazine Leflunomide Cyclosporin Antimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine) Azathioprine Apremilast Your rheumatologist will discuss the most appropriate choice of DMARD for you. It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it’s important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first. DMARD therapy is monitored according to guidelines such as British Society for Rheumatology (BSR). sore throat , a high temperature (fever), urinary problems or diarrhoea . a physiotherapist – who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile an occupational therapist – who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these a psychologist – who can offer psychological support if you need it a podiatrist who can offer assessment and advice on foot problems if affected during the course of PSA. Outlook Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. ",Between 20-40% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis affecting the skin affects around 3% of people. ,"blood tests to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as X-rays or scans of your joints. ","your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD because of other problems e.g. other diseases. Biological drugs work by directly blocking the chemicals in the blood, skin and joints that switch the immune system on, leading it to attack the lining of your joints and your skin. Some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on for more information about these medications.  Newer biological drugs include ustekinumab. Complementary therapies Managing related conditions As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions – such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) – if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke . You can also help yourself by: having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity losing weight, if you’re overweight not smoking only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol Read more about living with psoriasis and preventing CVD . Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis. If psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as: dents pits discolouration loosening from the nail bed This is less common if only your skin is affected.

Rhabdomyosarcoma,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/rhabdomyosarcoma/,Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumour). Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma are younger than 10 years old. It’s more common in boys than girls. ,"a tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding a tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation) How rhabdomyosarcoma is diagnosed Different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a biopsy ) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. These may include: a chest X-ray to check the lungs an ultrasound CT or MRI scans blood tests and bone marrow Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you Staging Radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this. Late side effects ",,,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Sarcomas are rare types of tumour that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. There are 2 main types of sarcomas: soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body. The most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina. Sometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord. The staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is based on: where in the body the tumour started if it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease). There are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child’s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given: to shrink the tumour before surgery after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back Surgery If it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started. Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick, hair loss , tiredness Late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",

Stopping smoking Read more about blood tests . Read more about stress or anxiety Primary Raynaud’s The most common form of Raynaud’s is primary Raynaud’s phenomenon. This means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition. Further testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud’s. you’re experiencing severe pain during an attack of Raynaud’s only one side of your body is affected Your GP may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. These capillaries are often larger in people with secondary Raynaud’s, and look like red pen marks. Blood tests Your GP may also refer you for blood tests a full blood count – to check for infection or, much less commonly, a cancer of the blood, such as leukaemia an antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test – to check for an overactive immune system, which is common in people with autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma and lupus erythrocyte sedimentation rate – to check for an autoimmune disorder Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK) If you’ve been diagnosed with Raynaud’s, Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK) may be helpful. It is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by the condition. Self-help The following advice is recommended for both primary and secondary Raynaud’s. Keep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. Wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather. Exercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). For most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. Read more about exercise . Try to minimise your stress levels. Regular exercise, eating a healthy diet , and relaxation techniques , such as deep breathing or activities such as yoga , can help. You may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker – a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen. Side effects are common and include: oedema – swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid headaches heart palpitations dizziness constipation Don’t drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse. The side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your GP if you find them particularly troublesome. There are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better. Other medications complications of Raynaud’s phenomenon. A type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. It involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm. puffy and itchy skin tight and uncomfortable joints small calcium spots and red spots under the skin trouble swallowing, known as dysphagia diarrhoea , bloating or constipation There’s no cure for scleroderma, but there are ways of overcoming problems it may cause. For example, medicines can reverse or slow down the processes that cause damage around the body. For more information, visit Scleroderma & Raynaud’s UK (SRUK) , a UK charity dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by Scleroderma and Raynaud’s. Ulcers and gangrene In severe cases of Raynaud’s, the blood supply to an affected body part can become severely diminished. Without a constant supply of blood, the tissue in the body part will begin to die. This problem is rare and normally only occurs in secondary Raynaud’s. The initial sign is an open sore, known as an ulcer, which develops on the surface of the body part. If you suspect a skin ulcer, contact your GP for advice. Left untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene). The affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. The dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off. These complications normally require admission to hospital, where you’ll be given medication designed to thin your blood, which should help to restore blood flow. ","Diagnosing Raynaud’s phenomenon and diagnosing Raynaud’s . Possible complications Secondary Raynaud’s can severely restrict the blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare. Read more about the complications of Raynaud’s . Who gets Raynaud’s? Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK. Primary Raynaud’s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud’s can develop at any age, depending on the cause. Raynaud’s is slightly more common in women than men. Raynaud’s phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body’s extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it’s sometimes linked to other health conditions. When your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. This is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body’s core temperature. In people with Raynaud’s, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow. There’s some evidence that primary Raynaud’s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families. Secondary Raynaud’s In some cases, an underlying health condition could be causing the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud’s. Autoimmune conditions The majority of cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue. Autoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary Raynaud’s include: rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren’s syndrome – where the immune system attacks the body’s sweat and tear glands lupus Around 1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s go on to develop an autoimmune condition. Infections Blood-born viral infections, hepatitis B and hepatitis C , can occasionally trigger Raynaud’s in some people. Cancer Some types of cancer can cause secondary Raynaud’s. These are usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia – a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children lymphoma – a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system multiple myeloma – a cancer that develops inside bone marrow Medicines Secondary Raynaud’s can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including: some types of anti- migraine medication – such as sumatriptan and ergotamine beta-blockers – which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease some chemotherapy medicines decongestants the contraceptive pill medicines used in hormone replacement therapy some types of medicines used to treat high blood pressure Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary Raynaud’s. Injury and overuse Raynaud’s sometimes results from a physical injury. It can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual. Skin and tissue damage caused by frostbite can also lead to Raynaud’s. Smoking Smoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing Raynaud’s. Read about the support available to help you quit smoking . Vibration white finger Vibration white finger is a term used when secondary Raynaud’s has been caused by vibration. This typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as: sanders, grinders and disc cutters hammer drills chainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowers Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. If the job can’t be done without vibrating tools: ask to use suitable low-vibration tools make sure you’re using the right tool for the job check tools are properly maintained keep cutting tools sharp reduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between keep warm at work wear anti-vibration gloves store tools indoors, so they don’t have cold handles when next used encourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaks If you’re diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. If you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully. By law, your employer must contact the Health and Safety Executive about your condition.

Diagnosing Raynaud’s phenomenon ",,"Complications of Raynaud’s phenomenon About Raynaud’s phenomenon Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body – usually the fingers and toes. It’s often referred to as Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease or just Raynaud’s. Why does it happen? Raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood. . Types of Raynaud’s There are two types of Raynaud’s: primary – when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type) secondary – when it’s caused by another health condition Most cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma and lupus . Secondary Raynaud’s may be suspected if: You can usually treat Raynaud’s phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary. therapies for stress . Medication Nifedipine sildenafil – which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection) Surgery Complications of Raynaud’s phenomenon People with Raynaud’s phenomenon have an increased risk of developing other problems, such as scleroderma. Scleroderma Around 1 in 16 women and 1 in 50 men with Raynaud’s develop a condition called scleroderma, usually between the ages of 25 and 55. Scleroderma is when the body produces excessively high levels of collagen. Scleroderma is a Greek word meaning hard skin, but it can affect other areas of the body, such as the kidneys, heart and lungs. ",
Schizophrenia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/schizophrenia/,Introduction ,"hallucinations – hearing or seeing things that do not exist delusions – unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence muddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions changes in behaviour Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness. This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality. Read more about the . Why does schizophrenia happen? The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is thought certain things make you more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition. Read more about the Read more information about how schizophrenia is diagnosed . Hallucinations A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices. Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations. Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices. Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer’s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or one place in particular, such as the television. Delusions A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months. Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions. Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend. Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street. Confused thoughts (thought disorder) People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme. People sometimes describe their thoughts as “misty” or “hazy” when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand. Changes in behaviour and thoughts A person’s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason. Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else. Another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions. losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say Increased risk Things that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include: Genetics Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no one gene is thought to be responsible. It’s more likely that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia. Evidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. This is true even if they are raised separately. In non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition. While this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia. Brain development Studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes aren’t seen in everyone with schizophrenia and can occur in people who don’t have a mental illness. But they suggest schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain. Neurotransmitters Research suggests schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. Some studies indicate an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. Others have found a change in the body’s sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia. Pregnancy and birth complications Research has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development. Triggers Triggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include: Stress The main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. These kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it. Drug abuse Drugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness. Three major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially “skunk” and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26. Want to know more? Mind: Community mental health team (CMHT) There are several related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. Your psychiatrist will ask how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as: bipolar disorder (manic depression) – people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions You should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions, such as depression, anxiety and substance misuse. Getting help for someone else As a result of their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there is nothing wrong with them. It is likely someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person’s care co-ordinator to express your concerns. If someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their GP. In the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available. If a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise how to do this. These episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care. Crisis resolution teams (CRT) It’s important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you. Antipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). Several slow-release antipsychotics are available. These require you to have one injection every two to four weeks. You may only need antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent. There are two main types of antipsychotics: typical antipsychotics – the first generation of antipsychotics developed during the 1950s atypical antipsychotics – newer-generation antipsychotics developed in the 1990s The choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects. Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person. The side effects of typical antipsychotics include: shaking trembling muscle twitches muscle spasms Side effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include: drowsiness weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics blurred vision constipation lack of sex drive dry mouth Tell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines that will help you deal with the side effects. Your medication should be reviewed at least once a year.

Arts therapy Arts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia. Some people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others. NICE recommends that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist registered with the Health and Care Professions Council who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia.

Who is affected? Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About 1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives. Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected equally. There is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist. It is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated. Read more about diagnosing schizophrenia . How is schizophrenia treated? Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Rethink Mental Illness: Schizophrenia Royal College of Psychiatrists: cannabis and mental health Related illnesses ","There is no single test for schizophrenia.

You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn. ","Living with Introduction Living with schizophrenia If schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include: recognising the signs of an acute episode taking medication as prescribed talking to others about the condition There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition. Read more about living with schizophrenia . Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 . Community mental health teams A CMHT can be made up of and provide access to: social workers community mental health nurses – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions occupational therapists pharmacists counsellors and psychotherapists psychologists and psychiatrists – the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team Care programme approach (CPA) There are four stages to a CPA: assessment – your health and social needs are assessed care plan – a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs care co-ordinator appointed – a care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT Not everyone uses the CPA. Some people may be cared for by their GP, while others may be under the care of a specialist. You will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency. Your care plan should include a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke, support for giving up. Your care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan. Want to know more? Rethink Mental Illness: Care programme approach fact sheet (PDF, 483kb) Acute episodes The CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre. CRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring. Your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis. Voluntary and compulsory detention More serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. You can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary. People can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 . It is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary: in the interests of the person’s own health and safety to protect others People with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards. An independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend you remain in hospital voluntarily. Advance statements If it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement. An advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include contact details for your care co-ordinator. If you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP. Antipsychotics Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts. For example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts. Most people will require between 8 and 20 sessions of CBT over the space of 6 to 12 months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour. Your GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist. Family therapy Many people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. While most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family. Family therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. It involves a series of informal meetings over a period of around six months. Meetings may include: discussing information about schizophrenia exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia Living with As well as monitoring your mental health, your healthcare team and GP should monitor your physical health. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise, is good for you and can reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes . You should also try to avoid too much stress and get a proper amount of sleep. You should have a check-up with your GP at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure, and any appropriate blood tests. Stop smoking Rates of smoking in people with schizophrenia are three times higher than in the general population. If you are a smoker, you are at a higher risk of developing cancer, heart disease and stroke. Stopping smoking has clear physical health benefits but it has also been shown to improve the mental health of people with schizophrenia. Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to quit smoking if you use NHS support as well as stop-smoking medicines, such as patches, gum or inhalators. Ask your doctor about this or phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84. If you take antipsychotic medicines and want to stop smoking it’s very important that you talk to your GP and/or psychiatrist before you stop as the dosage of your prescription drugs may need to be monitored and the amount you have to take could be reduced.

Mind: housing and mental health What can family, friends and partners do to help? Friends, relatives and partners have a vital role in helping people with schizophrenia recover and make a relapse less likely. It is very important not to blame the person with schizophrenia or tell them to “pull themselves together”, or to blame other people. It is important to stay positive and supportive when dealing with a friend or loved one’s mental illness. As well as supporting the person with schizophrenia, you may want to get support to cope with your own feelings. Several voluntary organisations provide help and support for carers. Friends and family can play a major role by monitoring the person’s mental state, watching out for any signs of relapse, and encouraging them to take their medication and attend medical appointments. If you are the nearest relative of a person who has schizophrenia, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the patient’s interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority ask an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with schizophrenia should be detained in hospital.

Retinoblastoma: Children,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/retinoblastoma-children/,,"If there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph. Some children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye. How retinoblastoma is diagnosed Tests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child’s eye while they’re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it’s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a biopsy Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ","The heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb. ",,"It’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Retinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina). There are 2 forms of retinoblastoma: a heritable form – this is genetic or inherited; there are often tumours in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in 1 eye a non-heritable form – this is not passed on in the family; there’s 1 tumour in only 1 eye (unilateral) Screening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for 5 years. An eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an ophthalmoscope. In younger children, this may need to be done under a general anaesthetic . When retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. This is known as staging. They may have some of the following tests: an ultrasound scan – this is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan – this uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head a lumbar puncture – the doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) then the fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present a bone marrow sample – this may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made); the doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells a bone scan – this involves taking a series of X-rays to check for signs of any spread to the bones a blood test – this may be taken for genetic testing for the Rb gene; the results of this test can take some months The doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs. Staging The following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma. Intraocular retinoblastoma There is cancer in 1 or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. This stage may be sub-divided into 5 grades (A–E), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there’s any damage to the eye. Extraocular retinoblastoma The cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body. Smaller tumours Cryotherapy This is used to freeze the tumours. More than 1 session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals. Laser therapy A laser is used to heat the tumour. Your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks. Plaque A small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. The disc needs to stay in place for up to 4 days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods. Thermotherapy Larger tumours Chemotherapy Chemotherapy can also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there’s a risk that it may spread. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine. Newer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy). Surgery If the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. The specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. An artificial eye is then fitted. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Clinical trials If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Children with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it. ",

Fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas. Fungal scalp infection (tinea capitis) Tinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin. Keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails. This explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails. How it spreads The fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. They thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. The spores can be spread in four different ways: human-to-human contact human-to-animal contact – for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat human-to-object contact – both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes human-to-soil contact – less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soil ",,"Preventing ringworm and other fungal infections About ringworm and other fungal infections Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn’t have anything to do with worms. Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. These fungal infections, medically known as ‘tinea’, are not serious and are usually easily treated.

For example, these could be a blood test or skin biopsy, where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined. If you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you’re not alone. There are millions of people living with the condition in the UK and across the world. You can find support and information from organisations like: Changing Faces – a charity for people with a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice Speak to your GP if you’re feeling depressed feeling like there is something in your eyes dry eyes irritated and bloodshot eyes inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) Rosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged.

Flushing Flushing is when your skin turns red for a short period – usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest. In some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat. In rosacea flushing is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See Helicobacter pylori bacteria Helicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria found in the digestive system. It’s been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although a link hasn’t been proven. One theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand. Genetics Rosacea seems to be more common in families, although it’s not clear which genes – if any – are involved or how they’re passed on. Triggers of rosacea Different people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include: exposure to sunlight stress hot or cold weather strong winds strenuous exercise alcohol hot baths spicy foods hot drinks humidity caffeine – found in tea, coffee and cola the menopause dairy products other medical conditions certain medicines – such as amiodarone, corticosteroids and high doses of vitamins B6 and B12 taking good care of your skin – for example, by using products suitable for sensitive skin using make-up – patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up keeping your eyelids clean – if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis) antibiotic medication may be recommended as these can help reduce inflammation of the skin. Antibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin. These medications are usually taken for 4 to 6 weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent. For example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term. Common side effects of these medications include: feeling and being sick diarrhoea bloating and indigestion tummy (abdominal) pain loss of appetite Some of the medications used can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds. Oral isotretinoin Isotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe acne , but at lower doses it’s also occasionally used to treat rosacea. Advice about how to avoid some common triggers can be found below. Sunlight As sunlight is the most commonly reported trigger of rosacea, you should use sun cream whenever possible, even when it’s overcast. A sun cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 is recommended. A broad-spectrum sun cream that protects against UVA and UVB light should be used. Using sun creams specifically designed for children may help reduce skin irritation. Covering exposed skin with clothes or a sun hat may also help. Try to minimise your exposure to the sun during the summer months, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest. But remember, sun can also be strong in the morning and evening, so take adequate precautions at these times as well. Stress Ways you can reduce stress include: learning relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga taking regular exercise Read about stress management . Food and drink Some of the most commonly reported food- and drink-related triggers are alcohol and spicy foods. You may want to try completely removing these from your diet to see if your rosacea improves. But there are many other dietary triggers that can also affect some people with rosacea. Cold weather Covering your face and nose with a scarf can help protect your skin from cold temperatures and wind. If you need to spend considerable time outside during cold weather, protect your face with a balaclava. Skincare techniques Clean your skin every morning and evening using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Use soap-free cleansers with non-alkaline or neutral pH. Avoid scented soaps and alcohol-based skin cleansers Rinse your face with lukewarm water and allow skin to dry thoroughly before you apply medication or make-up Look for products suitable for sensitive skin. These are usually described as mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (will not block pores) Use a moisturiser to soothe skin if it feels sore Avoid oil-based or waterproof cosmetics requiring solvents for removal. Use water-based make-up and skin products instead Avoid astringents, toners and other facial or hair products that contain ingredients that might irritate your skin, such as fragrances, alcohol, menthol, witch hazel, eucalyptus oil, camphor, clove oil, peppermint, sodium lauryl sulphate and lanolin Men may find that using an electric razor, rather than a blade, helps reduce skin irritation Some people find regular gentle facial massage reduces swelling (lymphoedema) Skin camouflage It may be possible to disguise patches of persistent red skin using specially designed camouflage make-up. The charity Changing Faces offers a skin camouflage service , available nationally and free of charge, to help with the use of these creams. Your GP or dermatologist can refer you to the skin camouflage service and prescribe skin camouflage make-up. Eyelid hygiene ","The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face. These include: exposure to sunlight stress strenuous exercise hot or cold weather hot drinks alcohol and caffeine certain foods, such as spicy foods Read about for more information about possible triggers. Persistent facial redness Persistent facial redness (erythema) is like a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn’t go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol. This can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers. The redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest. Visible blood vessels Over time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened (dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia. Papules and pustules If you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules). These spots appear on your face and are similar to acne . Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2 conditions are quite different. In rosacea there are no blackheads and the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don’t cause scarring. Thickened skin Rhinophyma is an uncommon, severe symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It almost exclusively affects men. The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested. It’s possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn’t enough evidence to say this for certain. Some of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below. Blood vessel abnormalities Skin peptides Recent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides. Increased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or nerves and blood vessels (neurovascular system) of the skin. Activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation. Microscopic mites Microscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition. ",,"Preventing rosacea About rosacea Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face. avoiding known triggers – for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine creams and gels – medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness oral medications – tablets or capsules that can help clear up more severe spots, such as oral antibiotics Read about more about and self-help measures for rosacea Living with rosacea Any long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others. Many people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration. It’s important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable. Ocular rosacea Rosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious. Self-help measures If you have round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective. Topical medications are usually prescribed first. These include: metronidazole cream or gel azelaic acid cream or gel ivermectin cream Oral antibiotics Common side effects of isotretinoin include: dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or eyes (conjunctivitis) headaches muscle or joint pain back pain blood in your urine (haematuria) mood changes Isotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. But as well as the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help. Brimonidine tartrate Brimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a gel that’s applied to the face once a day. The medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it’s first used, and this can last for around 12 hours. Common side effects of brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied. Less common side effects can include: a dry mouth headaches pins and needles dry skin A rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication. Alternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea. These include: clonidine – a medication that relaxes the blood vessels beta-blockers – medications that decrease the activity of the heart anxiety medications – medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing bruising crusting of the skin swelling and redness of the skin blisters (in rare cases) infection (in very rare cases) These side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent. In some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as rhinophyma. If you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to discuss ways the appearance of your skin can be improved. This may be done with a laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion. For example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis. Preventing rosacea If you have rosacea, there are a number of things you can do to help keep the condition under control. Avoid triggers ",

Joints and tendons Reactive arthritis usually involves inflammation of the joints ( arthritis ) and tendons, which can cause: joint pain, tenderness and swelling – usually in weight-bearing joints such as your knees, feet and ankles lower back and buttock pain swelling of your fingers and toes joint stiffness – particularly in the morning See your GP if you have any swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had diarrhoea or problems passing urine. The urinary system pain or a burning sensation when you pee urinating more often than usual having a sudden urge to pee a discharge of fluid from the penis or vagina blood in your urine (less commonly) The eyes Reactive arthritis may occasionally involve inflammation of the eyes ( conjunctivitis red eyes watery eyes eye pain swollen eye lids feeling unusually tired a high temperature (fever) weight loss mouth ulcers painless white patches inside your mouth a rash thick and crumbly nails abdominal (tummy) pain bouts of diarrhoea Exactly how the gene contributes to the development of reactive arthritis is unclear. Most people will make a full recovery in about six months, although around one in five cases lasts a year or more, and a small number of people experience long-term joint problems. There is also a risk you could develop the condition again after another infection. Self-care In the initial stages of reactive arthritis, it’s recommended that you get plenty of rest and avoid using affected joints. Your GP or specialist may recommend a suitable exercise programme for your arthritis . Alternatively, you may be referred to a physiotherapist for physical therapy. You might also find ice packs and heat pads useful in reducing joint pain and swelling, although these should not be directly placed on your skin. Antibiotics Antibiotics Steroids work by blocking the effects of many of the chemicals the body uses to trigger inflammation. A corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually the preferred choice. Prednisolone can be given as an injection into a joint or as a tablet. Eye drops are also available if you have inflamed eyes ( conjunctivitis ). Around 1 in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state, such as depression or hallucinations. Contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behaviour. Other side effects can include weight gain, acne , stomach ulcers and osteoporosis , although these should improve as your dose is decreased. Read more about the side effects of corticosteroids . Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Like corticosteroids, DMARDs work by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals your immune system uses to trigger inflammation. It can take a few months before you notice a DMARD working, so it’s important to keep taking medication even if you don’t see immediate results. A DMARD called sulfasalazine is usually the preferred option. Common side effects of sulfasalazine include feeling sick, loss of appetite and headaches , although these usually improve once your body gets used to the medication. DMARDs may also cause changes in your blood or liver, so it’s important to have regular blood tests while taking these medicines. ","It usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without causing long-term problems. The three most common places affected by reactive arthritis are: the joints ( arthritis ), which can cause pain, stiffness and swelling the eyes ( conjunctivitis ), which can cause eye pain and redness the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body) However, most people will not experience all of these problems. Read more about the Reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel. For reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed. Read more about the . Seeking medical advice The immune system Infection The two most common types of infection linked to reactive arthritis are: sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea , although many cases occur after non-gonococcal urethritis infections of the bowel and digestive system (gastrointestinal infections) – usually caused by either campylobacter or salmonella bacteria, both of which can cause food poisoning Genetic factors Research has shown that people with a specific gene known as HLA-B27 have a significantly increased chance of developing reactive arthritis, as well as related conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the spine) . In the UK, it’s estimated that around 1 in every 10 people have the HLA-B27 gene. Around 3 out of every 4 cases of reactive arthritis develop in people with the gene. ",,"About reactive arthritis . Who is affected Reactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40. Men are generally affected more than woman – particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men. People who have a certain gene called HLA-B27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the UK, are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don’t have this gene. Preventing reactive arthritis The most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and bowel infections that most commonly cause the condition. The most effective way of preventing STIs is to always use a barrier method of contraception , such as a condom , during sex with a new partner. Read advice on contraception and sexual health . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen , are the main medication used for reactive arthritis, as they can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. However, taking a regular dose of a NSAID on a long-term basis can increase your risk of problems such as stomach ulcers . If you are at an increased risk of developing stomach ulcers, your GP may recommend an additional medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which can protect your stomach by reducing the production of stomach acid. Rarely, long-term use of NSAIDs can also slightly increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke . Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs .

Men usually have 1 or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis and scrotum). In infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different places on their body, including on the: face head neck scalp palms of the hands soles of the feet Scabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. These marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin. In infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. eczema or impetigo (a highly contagious bacterial skin infection). Read more about the . Ink test The burrows of scabies mites can be identified by using an ink test. Ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin before being wiped off with an alcohol pad. If scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line. , your GP will need to rule these out.

Scabies outbreaks Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: Africa Central and South America northern and central Australia Caribbean Islands India southeast Asia In developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes. In the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year. It’s difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don’t visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines. Scabies is a skin condition caused by the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei. The intense itching associated with scabies is thought to be caused by the immune system reacting to the mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces. The scabies mite life cycle A scabies infestation starts when a female mite burrows into your skin. Male mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. After mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which hatch around 3 to 4 days later. After hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. Male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. The life cycle is then repeated. psoriasis Crusted scabies affects people with a weakened immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). This includes: the very young people with brain disorders (neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease ) people with Down’s syndrome pregnant women elderly people people with a condition that affects their immune system, such as HIV or AIDs people who are taking steroids to treat other medical conditions people who are having chemotherapy ","Where to get help with scabies Visit your GP if you think you have scabies.

If you decide to treat scabies yourself, you’ll need to have a full sexual health check to make sure you don’t have any sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . To prevent reinfection, it’s important that all members of your household are treated, as well as any sexual partners you’ve had over the last 6 weeks (in the case of genital scabies). If you’ve had genital scabies in the past, anyone you’ve had sex with in the previous 48 hours will need to be treated. If you’re embarrassed about contacting previous sexual partners, your GP surgery or local sexual health clinic may be able to inform them that they’ve been exposed to scabies on your behalf without disclosing your identity. Sexual health clinics Some sexual health clinics operate on a walk-in basis. Others work by appointment only. It’s therefore a good idea to call first. When you attend a clinic, you’ll be asked for your name, date of birth and contact details. These details will be treated confidentially and won’t be passed on to your GP without your agreement.

Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity. Read more about complications of scabies . How scabies is spread Scabies mites can’t fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2 people have direct and prolonged physical contact. For example, scabies mites can be transmitted by: holding hands with an infected person for a prolonged period of time having sex with an infected person sharing clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although this is rare) It’s unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging. Scabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels or bed linen a possibility. However, it’s rare for someone to be infected in this way. Scabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware they have the condition until 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection. There’s an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another. Diagnosing scabies Your GP should be able to diagnose scabies from the appearance of your skin, and by looking for the burrow marks of the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.

If you’re unable to wash certain items, place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. After this time, the scabies mites will have died. In cases of crusted scabies, you should clean the floors in your house and thoroughly vacuum your carpets and furniture, including the armchairs and sofa. Oral sedative antihistamines are also available from your local pharmacy and can be used to control itching and help you get a better night’s sleep. As this type of antihistamine can cause drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you’re affected in this way. Non-sedating antihistamines don’t help relieve the itching of scabies. Check with your GP or pharmacist if you’re unsure. Complications of scabies A secondary infection and crusted scabies are 2 possible complications of scabies. Secondary infection Repeatedly scratching itchy skin caused by scabies may break the skin’s surface. This will make you more vulnerable to developing a bacterial skin infection, such as impetigo . Antibiotics may be recommended to control a secondary infection. Scabies has been known to make some pre-existing skin conditions, such as eczema , worse. However, other skin conditions should settle down after the scabies infection has been successfully treated. Crusted scabies Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies. This means thousands or even millions of scabies mites are present. Normal scabies can develop into crusted scabies after a skin reaction. The condition affects all parts of the body, including your head, neck, nails and scalp. However, unlike normal scabies, the rash associated with crusted scabies usually doesn’t itch. Research has found a healthy immune system appears to interrupt the reproductive cycle of the scabies mite . For example, most people with scabies will only have 5 to 15 mites on their body at any one time. However, if you have a weakened immune system, the number of scabies mites can increase significantly. People with crusted scabies can have thousands or millions of scabies mites on their body at any one time. Because of the high number of scabies mites, crusted scabies is highly contagious. Even minimal physical contact with a person with crusted scabies, or with their bed linen or clothes, can lead to infection. However, contact with someone with crusted scabies will only lead to the normal type of scabies in people with a healthy immune system. Crusted scabies can be treated using insecticide creams or a medicine called ivermectin, which is taken by swallowing a tablet. Ivermectin kills the mites by stopping their nervous system working. ",

This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome. Read more about the Read more about Outlook insomnia ) and trigger anxiety and depression . Just over half of people with restless legs syndrome also experience episodes of lowerback pain. Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) Up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds. PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting. Dopamine There’s evidence to suggest restless legs syndrome is related to a problem with part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia uses a chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement. are often worse in the evening and during the night. Underlying health condition Restless legs syndrome can sometimes occur as a complication of another health condition, or it can be the result of another health-related factor. This is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.

Aiding sleep If restless legs syndrome is disrupting your sleep, a short-term course of medication may be recommended to help you sleep. These types of medication are known as hypnotics, and include temazepam and loprazolam. Hypnotics are usually only recommended for short-term use (typically no longer than a week). You may find you still feel sleepy or “hungover” the morning after taking your medication. Levodopa The medication will make you feel very sleepy (often suddenly), so you should never drive or use tools or machinery after taking levodopa. ","Diagnosing restless legs syndrome It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too. Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). In the majority of cases, there’s no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. The sensation may also affect your arms, chest and face, too. It has been described as: tingling, burning, itching or throbbing a “creepy-crawly” feeling feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves These unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable, and are usually worse in the evening and during the night. They can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs. In many cases, the exact cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown. When no cause can be found, it’s known as “idiopathic” or primary restless legs syndrome. Dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day, which may explain why the anaemia , diabetes and kidney function problems. It’s particularly important to find out the levels of iron in your blood because low iron levels can sometimes cause secondary restless legs syndrome. Low iron levels can be treated with iron tablets. Sleep tests If you have restless legs syndrome and your sleep is being severely disrupted, sleep tests – such as a suggested immobilisation test – may be recommended. The test involves lying on a bed for a set period of time without moving your legs while any involuntary leg movements are monitored. Occasionally, polysomnography may be recommended. This is a test that measures your breathing rate, brain waves and heartbeat throughout the course of a night. The results will confirm whether you have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). ","an overwhelming urge to move your legs, usually with an uncomfortable sensation such as itching or tingling ","About restless legs syndrome adopting good sleep habits – for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night quitting smoking if you smoke exercising regularly during the daytime Who’s affected by restless legs syndrome? As many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life. bipolar disorder high blood pressure some antihistamines metoclopramide – used to relieve nausea Other possible triggers include: excessive smoking , caffeine or alcohol being overweight or obese stress lack of exercise Diagnosing restless legs syndrome There’s no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome. Blood tests Your GP may refer you for blood tests Mild restless legs syndrome that isn’t linked to an underlying health condition can be managed with just a few lifestyle changes. iron deficiency anaemia can be treated by taking iron supplements. If it’s associated with pregnancy, it usually disappears on its own within four weeks of the birth. Lifestyle changes A number of lifestyle changes may be enough to ease the Painkillers A mild opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol, may be prescribed to relieve pain associated with restless legs syndrome.

Rheumatoid arthritis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/muscle-bone-and-joints/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/,About rheumatoid arthritis ,"Read more about the and living with rheumatoid arthritis . When to seek medical advice Possible complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammation of other areas of the body (such as the lungs, heart and eyes), and an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes . Ensuring that rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled helps reduce your risk of complications such as these. Read more about the complications of rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints, although it can cause problems in other parts of the body too. Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case. Pain The joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity. Stiffness Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist. Like joint pain, the stiffness is often more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called osteoarthritis usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often lasts longer than this. Swelling, warmth and redness The lining of joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch. In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints. tiredness and a lack of energy a high temperature (fever) sweating a poor appetite weight loss The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, including dry eyes if the eyes are affected and chest pain if the heart or lungs are affected. Read more about the complications of rheumatoid arthritis . When to seek medical advice Seeing your GP If your GP thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist). Your GP may arrange blood tests DMARDs work by blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. There are many different DMARDs that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) In addition to – or instead of – the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) . This may be a traditional NSAID (such as ibuprofen , naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib). These medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time. Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them. Although uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems – such as internal bleeding – because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids. If you are prescribed an NSAID tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation. They can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints). They are usually used to provide short-term pain relief – for example, while you are waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up. Corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, osteoporosis (thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin. Physiotherapy A physiotherapist may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible. They may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Occupational therapy There is also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you are taking steroids and folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate. However, there is some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis. Living with rheumatoid arthritis Self-management Taking control of rheumatoid arthritis will help you cope with its impact on your lifestyle. Arthritis Care offers self-management training courses to teach techniques for living positively with arthritis. Techniques include relaxation and breathing exercises to help pain control, goal-setting exercises and positive thinking to help give you some control over your condition. A self-management programme specifically for people with rheumatoid arthritis has been developed by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS). The course helps people learn more about their condition and provides practical tips on how to manage everyday life. Talk to others Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from an individual or group of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Patient organisations have local support groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the same condition. Call the NRAS helpline free on 0800 298 7650 to speak to a trained rheumatoid arthritis adviser. NRAS also has a team of medical advisers. You can also call Arthritis Care’s free, confidential helpline on 0808 800 4050 (Monday-Friday, 10am-4pm). Your feelings It can be hard to deal with the unpredictable nature of rheumatoid arthritis. Some days, the pain and stiffness will be much worse than others, and there is no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur. The difficult nature of rheumatoid arthritis can mean that some people develop depression or feelings of stress and anxiety. Sometimes, these feelings can be related to poorly controlled pain or fatigue. Living with any long-term condition makes you more likely to have a range of emotions such as frustration, fear, pain, anger and resentment. Speak to your healthcare team if you are struggling to deal with your condition emotionally. They may be able to offer medication or psychological interventions to help. Starting and raising a family If you are taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or if you are worried about becoming pregnant while on medication. corticosteroid injections, although surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve may be needed in severe cases. Widespread inflammation As rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, it can cause inflammation to develop in other parts of your body, such as the: Lungs – inflammation of the lungs or lung lining can lead to pleurisy or pulmonary fibrosis , which can cause chest pain , a persistent cough and shortness of breath . ","Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis The hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system – which usually fights infection – attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful. Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone. It’s not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke. Read more about the . Who is affected Rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the UK. It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected. How rheumatoid arthritis is treated Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by the body’s immune system attacking itself. However, it is not yet known what triggers this. Normally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint. bones cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilage If the condition is not treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and, eventually, can destroy the joint completely. Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, including that an infection or virus may trigger this, but none of these theories has been proven. Possible risk factors There are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including: your genes – there is some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition hormones – rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen that is found at higher levels in women, although this has not been conclusively proven smoking – some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis Want to know more? National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there is no definitive test for the condition. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies occupational therapy may help. An occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you are at home and at work. Some type of support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help open jars or turn on taps. Podiatry If you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help. You may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain. Surgery Sometimes, despite medication, damage to your joints may occur. In such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint. Surgery may also be recommended to reduce pain or correct deformities. Finger, hand and wrist surgery There are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. Examples include: carpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve) release of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending removal of inflamed tissue that lines the finger joints Arthroscopy Arthroscopy is a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue. During the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so that the surgeon can see the affected joint. Special surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. You usually do not have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days. Joint replacement Some people with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery to replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. This is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty. Replacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation. The latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. They are not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one. Read more about knee replacement and hip replacement . Complementary and alternative therapies Many people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as: massage acupuncture osteopathy chiropractic In most cases, there is little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them. Nutritional supplements and dietary changes Eyes – inflammation of the eyes can lead to scleritis or Sjogren’s syndrome . Scleritis can cause eye redness and pain, whereas Sjogren’s syndrome can cause dry eyes. Blood vessels – inflammation of the blood vessels is known as vasculitis. This can lead to the thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring of blood vessel walls. In serious cases, it can affect blood flow to your body’s organs and tissues and can be life-threatening. ","Blood tests Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) In an ESR test, a sample of your red blood cells is placed into a test tube of liquid. The cells are then timed to see how fast they fall to the bottom of the tube (measured in millimetres per hour). If they are sinking faster than usual, you may have an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. C-reactive protein (CRP) A CRP test can indicate if there is inflammation anywhere in the body by checking how much CRP is present in your blood. CRP is produced by the liver. If there is more CRP than usual, there is inflammation in your body. Full blood count The full blood count will measure your red cells to rule out anaemia. Anaemia is a condition where the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, due to a lack of blood cells. Another antibody test known as anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also available. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody. ","Living with rheumatoid arthritis Complications of rheumatoid arthritis About rheumatoid arthritis Read more about diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis . surgery to correct any joint problems that develop Read more about . Possible complications Read more about diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis . Joint imaging A number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. These can help differentiate between different types of arthritis and can be used to monitor how your condition is progressing over time. Scans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include: X-rays – where radiation is passed through your body to examine your bones and joints ultrasound scans – where high frequency sound waves are used to create an image of joints magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans – where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your joints Stopping the condition progressing There are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Common side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth, diarrhoea , headaches and hair loss. The medication can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver, so you will have regular blood tests to monitor this. Less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chest X-ray and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop shortness of breath or a persistent dry cough while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well. It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first. You may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that is most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term. They are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective. Biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints. Some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB) in people who have had them in the past. Relieving pain In addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain. Some of the different medicines that may be used to relieve pain are outlined below. Painkillers In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as paracetamol , or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly so if you have rheumatoid arthritis. If you are struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you. You may also be able to get additional support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family. Sex and relationships Pain, discomfort and changes in the way you feel can affect your sex life. Your self-esteem or thoughts about how you look may affect your confidence. Although many people find it difficult to talk about such private issues, there are resources that might help you. Talking to your partner or GP about the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on your sexuality and sexual relationships may help. Money and benefits If you have to stop work or work part time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially. You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support: If you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer. If you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance . If you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for a Personal Independence Payment . If you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance . If you are caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance . You may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.

Complications of rheumatoid arthritis Having rheumatoid arthritis can put you at a higher risk of developing other conditions, particularly if it isn’t well controlled. Carpal tunnel syndrome C arpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Joint damage If rheumatoid arthritis is not treated early or is not well controlled, the inflammation in your joints could lead to significant and permanent damage. Problems that can affect the joints include: damage to nearby bone and cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints) damage to nearby tendons (flexible tissue that attach muscle to bone), which could cause them to break (rupture) joint deformities These problems will sometimes need to be treated with surgery to prevent loss of function in the affected joints. Cardiovascular disease If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than the population at large. CVD is a general term that describes conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels, and it includes life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes . It’s not clear exactly why people with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of these problems, but you can reduce your risk by ensuring your arthritis is well controlled and by reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to CVD, such as by stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly. Read more about preventing CVD . Cervical myelopathy If you have had rheumatoid arthritis for some time, you are at increased risk of developing cervical myelopathy and you may need a special assessment of your neck before any operation where you are put to sleep. This condition is caused by dislocation of joints at the top of the spine, which put pressure on the spinal cord. Although relatively uncommon, it is a serious condition that can greatly affect your mobility and can lead to permanent spinal cord damage if not treated promptly with surgery. ",

Septic shock,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/septic-shock/,"Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level after an infection. Any type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare. At first the infection can lead to a reaction called sepsis. This begins with: weakness chills a rapid heart and breathing rate Left untreated, toxins produced by bacteria can damage the small blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues. This can affect your heart’s ability to pump blood to your organs, which lowers your blood pressure and means blood doesn’t reach vital organs, such as the brain and liver. Phone 999 immediately if: ","low blood pressure (hypotension) that makes you feel dizzy when you stand up a change in your mental state, like confusion or disorientation diarrhoea nausea and vomiting cold, clammy and pale skin Who is more at risk of developing septic shock? People with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing septic shock. This includes: newborn babies elderly people pregnant women people with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, cirrhosis or kidney failure people with lowered immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS or those receiving chemotherapy ",,,"oxygen therapy fluids given directly through a vein (intravenously) medication to increase your blood flow antibiotics surgery (in some cases) Oxygen therapy To help you breathe more easily, you’ll be given oxygen through a face mask, a tube inserted into your nose, or an endotracheal tube inserted into your mouth. If you have severe shortness of breath , a mechanical ventilator may be used. Increasing blood flow You’ll probably be given fluids directly into a vein. This will help raise your blood pressure by increasing the amount of fluid in your blood. To increase the blood flow to your vital organs, such as your brain, liver, kidneys and heart, you may be prescribed inotropic medicines or vasopressors. Inotropic medicines Inotropic medicines (inotropes), such as dobutamine, stimulate your heart. They increase the strength of your heartbeat, which helps get oxygen-rich blood to your tissues and organs, where it’s needed. Vasopressors Vasopressors include: dopamine adrenaline noradrenaline These medicines will cause your blood vessels to narrow, increasing your blood pressure and the flow of blood around your body. This will allow your vital organs to start functioning properly. Antibiotics Antibiotics are often used to treat the associated bacterial infection. The type of antibiotic used depends on the type of bacterial infection and where in the body the infection started. You may be started on antibiotics immediately to increase your chances of survival. Initially, two or three types of antibiotics may be used. The most effective type of antibiotic can be used once the bacterium responsible for the infection is identified. Surgery In severe cases of sepsis or septic shock, the large decrease in blood pressure and blood flow can kill organ tissue. If this happens, surgery may be required to remove the dead tissue. Complications of septic shock The chances of surviving septic shock will depend on: the cause of infection the number of organs that have failed Complications of septic shock can include: inability of the lungs to take in enough oxygen (respiratory failure) the heart not being able to pump enough blood around the body (heart failure) kidney failure or injury abnormal blood clotting These are serious health conditions that will need to be treated urgently. Septic shock can be fatal because of complications like these. ",

In women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness. Read more about the Read more about diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome Dry eyes and mouth can usually be helped with artificial tears and saliva. It’s important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as corneal ulcers and tooth decay . In severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended. Read more about Further information on Sjögren’s syndrome Information about you If you have Sjögren’s syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register Many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful. A dry mouth can lead to: tooth decay and gum disease dry cough difficulty swallowing and chewing hoarse voice difficulty speaking swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears) repeated fungal infections in the mouth ( oral thrush Dry eyes can lead to: burning or stinging eyes itchy eyes a feeling that there’s grit in your eyes irritated and swollen eyelids sensitivity to light (photophobia) tired eyes mucus discharge from your eyes in a windy or smoky environment in an air-conditioned building travelling on aeroplane dry skin tiredness and fatigue – which are common and can lead to total exhaustion muscle pain joint pain, stiffness and swelling vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning menopause , when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness could make the condition more noticeable. Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome Sjögren’s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus . This is known as secondary Sjögren’s syndrome. The exocrine glands The importance of tears We usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film. Tears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They: lubricate the eye keep the eye clean and free of dust protect the eye against infection help stabilise your vision The importance of saliva Saliva also serves several important functions, including: keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections) Diagnosing Sjogren’s syndrome dry mouth Screening questions Experts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you’re worried you may have Sjögren’s syndrome. If you answer “yes” to most of the questions below, you may have Sjögren’s syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests. Have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months? Do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye? Do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day? Have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months? Do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)? Do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food? Further testing Tests used to diagnose Sjögren’s syndrome include: tear break-up time and Schirmer tests a lip biopsy blood tests salivary flow rate These are explained below. Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests . Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears. Side effects of pilocarpine include: hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) nausea diarrhoea heartburn abdominal (stomach) pain an increased need to go to the toilet For some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits. Don’t take pilocarpine if you have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , or if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Hydroxychloroquine Dry skin Several soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you. Vaginal dryness Vaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) . Muscle and joint pains Muscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) , such as ibuprofen . If this doesn’t work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription. NSAIDs can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers and internal bleeding, particularly if they’re taken on a long-term basis. If you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that’s rubbed into affected joints. NSAIDs aren’t recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions. General advice These simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sjögren’s syndrome: have a dental check-up every six months practise good dental hygiene – brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly avoid eating too many sweet foods avoid strong and perfumed soaps – use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible avoid drinking too much alcohol Complications of Sjogren’s syndrome Sjögren’s syndrome isn’t usually life-threatening, but it is linked to more seriousproblems. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma It’s estimated that people with Sjögren’s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma than people without the condition. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) that are spread throughout your body, much like your blood vessels. While this increased risk may sound alarming, the chance of a person with Sjögren’s syndrome developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is still small, as it only affects around 5% of people with the syndrome. However, if you have Sjögren’s syndrome, you should be aware of the main early symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland) – usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Report any swollen lymph nodes to your GP. Eye damage If dry eyes aren’t treated, they can become inflamed and you can develop ulcers on the surface of your eyes (corneal ulcers). If left untreated, corneal ulcers can lead to loss of vision and permanent sight damage. Pregnancy If you’re planning to become pregnant and have Sjögren’s syndrome, ask your GP to test for certain antibodies that may be present in Sjögren’s syndrome and are known to cause a temporary lupus rash in newborn babies. In very rare cases, the antibodies can also cause heart defects in babies. If these antibodies are found, there should be no reason why you can’t continue with the pregnancy, but your child may need additional specialist care during pregnancy and after the birth. Read more about antenatal appointments Other conditions A number of other conditions have been linked to Sjögren’s syndrome, including: peripheral neuropathy – a condition that often involves loss of sensation in the hands and feet Raynaud’s phenomenon – restricted blood flow to the hands, which can cause them to feel cold, numb and painful kidney problems – such as inflammation or kidney stones an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – which can lead to tiredness and weight gain irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) – which can cause abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements teeth cavities ","Diagnosing Sjogren’s syndrome Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue. In Sjögren’s syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands, and other secretory glands throughout the body. The reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it’s triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors. Some people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they’re born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system. Read more about the Healthcare professionals classify Sjögren’s syndrome as being either: primary – when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition secondary – when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome The immune system Your immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill. In Sjögren’s syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands. The antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There’s some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness. The immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs. Possible triggers for Sjögren’s syndrome Primary Sjögren’s syndrome Most researchers believe that primary Sjögren’s syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly. ",,"Complications of Sjogren’s syndrome About Sjogren’s syndrome Sjögren’s (pronounced Show-grin’s) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body’s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands. Complications of Sjögren’s syndrome Sjögren’s syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn’t treated. Sjögren’s syndrome also increases your risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma , which is a cancer of the lymph glands. However, the chances are still low, at around 5%. Women with Sjögren’s syndrome have an increased risk of having children with a temporary “lupus” rash or heart abnormalities. Any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems. Read more about the complications of Sjögren’s syndrome Who’s affected by Sjögren’s syndrome? Sjögren’s syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases. The tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are. A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate. This test is also carried out using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely. In the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears. Lip biopsy During a lip biopsy , a small tissue sample is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A local anaesthetic is injected into the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands. Clusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sjögren’s syndrome. Blood tests Blood tests are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sjögren’s syndrome. These antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sjögren’s syndrome, so it’s possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition. Salivary flow rate A salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce. You’ll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sjögren’s syndrome. Eye care Artificial tears Mild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing “artificial tears” – a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription. There are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you’re using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn’t contain preservatives. This is because there’s evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye. A short-term dose of eye drops containing corticosteroids may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However, long-term corticosteroid use isn’t recommended because they can cause serious side effects. To minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you’ll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Moisture chamber spectacles Wearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants. Some people used to be embarrassed to wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses. Punctal plugs Punctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep the eye better protected by tears. Temporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used. Mouth care Looking after your mouth A number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including: maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent tooth decay and gum disease increasing your fluid intake using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness regularly using mouth rinses to soothe your mouth and protect it against infection If you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates. Read more about how to stop smoking Saliva substitutes There are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don’t replicate the role of saliva in preventing infection, so you’ll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene. Saliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you. Medication for Sjögren’s syndrome Pilocarpine The medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the Side effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include: nausea skin rash loss of appetite stomach cramps vomiting Hydroxychloroquine shouldn’t be used by breastfeeding women. ",

Skin cancer (non-melanoma),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/skin-cancer-non-melanoma/,About non-melanoma skin cancer ,"Types of non-melanoma skin cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. The 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: basal cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Why does it happen? Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or freckles Read more about the The main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn’t heal. The lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour. Non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and shoulders. Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or ‘waxy’ looking. It can also look like a red, scaly patch. The lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer. Squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump and may have a flat, scaly and crusted surface. The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer. Bowen’s disease Bowen’s disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as ‘squamous cell carcinoma in situ’. It develops slowly and is easily treated. The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin. When to seek medical advice If you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.

Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. It affects slightly more men than women. Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight. Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light: ultraviolet A (UVA) ultraviolet B (UVB) ultraviolet C (UVC) UVC is filtered out by the Earth’s atmosphere but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Repeated sunburn , either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer. Family history Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased. Increased risk Certain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: pale skin that does not tan easily red or blonde hair blue eyes older age a large number of moles a large number of freckles . Macmillan: . Diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer After about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. Cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin. Mohs micrographic surgery Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when: it’s felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes It involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. This minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring. Each time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. The procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure the cancer is completely removed. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. In the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin. This type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. As only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. However, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma, Bowen’s disease and actinic keratoses. It involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light. ","Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. Your GP may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don’t need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope.

In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE However, they will probably also perform a biopsy – a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. This is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic , meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won’t feel pain. This allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body. ","About non-melanoma skin cancer Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. The term ‘non-melanoma’ distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma , which spreads faster in the body. The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn’t heal after a few weeks. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. Speak to your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. Read more about the It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases. Read more about Complications If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours. a condition that suppresses your immune system, such as HIV medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants exposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic It may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy. Further tests If you have basal cell carcinoma (BCC), then you usually won’t require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread. However, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body. These tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). If cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell. If the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. This is called a fine needle aspiration (FNA). During FNA, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. Finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body. People with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse. the type of cancer you have the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread) your general health The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced healthcare guidelines about NHS skin cancer services. These outline NICE’s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated. Read further information: NICE: improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma Surgical excision Surgical excision is an operation to cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed. It may be done in combination with a skin graft, if it’s likely to leave significant scarring. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. In many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer. Curettage and electrocautery Curettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small. The surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed. Cryotherapy Imiquimod cream Common side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin and itchiness. Less common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin. Wash the cream off and contact your GP if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. The level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. However, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if: surgery would be unsuitable the cancer covers a large area the area is difficult to operate on Radiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant radiotherapy. Electrochemotherapy surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t worked The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes. These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed). Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers. It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated. Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin .

Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. "
Shortness of breath,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/shortness-of-breath/,"Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department. It’s also one of the most common reasons people phone 999 for an ambulance. It’s normal to get out of breath when you’ve overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it’s usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: sudden shortness of breath long-term shortness of breath This guide shouldn’t be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what’s causing your breathlessness. When to phone a doctor You should phone your GP immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is mild or the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while, don’t ignore it. See your GP as it’s likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity , asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? How bad is it? Does it only happen when you’ve been active, or when you’re not doing anything? Is there any pain when you breathe? Do you have a cough? Do certain positions make it worse – for example, are you unable to lie down? Feeling like you can’t get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. ","In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you’re having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they’ll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). Panic attack or anxiety A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness. ","Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions. A problem with your lungs or airways Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It’s usually caused by an infection, so you’ll need to take antibiotics . If you have COPD, it’s likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. A heart problem It’s possible to have a “silent” heart attack These include: a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) pneumothorax – partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs pulmonary embolism – a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung diabetic ketoacidosis – a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesity or being unfit poorly controlled asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking anaemia – a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) heart failure – when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) bronchiectasis – a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough pulmonary embolism – a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung partial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body frequent panic attacks , which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths) ",,,

Slapped cheek rash Image source: dermnetnz.org After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (‘slapped cheeks’) normally appears. Adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two. Occasionally, the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don’t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome as it normally gets better on its own. Speak to your GP practice if: you’re pregnant – there’s a very small risk of miscarriage or other complications you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia you have a weakened immune system shortness of breath , extreme tiredness or fainting If your GP is closed, phone 111 . In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you’re immune to the infection. If you’re not immune, you’ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it’s likely that you’ll be sent to hospital for a blood transfusion . What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome Do rest drink plenty of fluids – babies should continue their normal feeds take paracetamol or ibuprofen for a high temperature, headaches or joint pain – children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin use an emollient (moisturising lotion) on itchy skin speak to a pharmacist about itchy skin – they can recommend the best antihistamine for children Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, you do not have to stay away from work or school once the rash has developed. The infection is no longer contagious by this point. Let your child’s school know if your child has slapped cheek syndrome. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu . You can become infected by: inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome Make sure that everyone you live with washes their hands often to help stop the infection from spreading. There’s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition. ","Slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in 1 to 3 weeks.

If you’re pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. ",,,
Spleen problems and spleen removal,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/spleen-problems-and-spleen-removal/,"Some people are born without a spleen or need to have it removed because of disease or injury. The spleen is a fist-sized organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs. It’s an important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen’s functions. What does the spleen do? The spleen has a few important functions. It fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells). It controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots). It screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells. If the spleen doesn’t work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. This can lead to: anaemia , from a reduced number of red blood cells an increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells bleeding or bruising, from a reduced number of platelets Spleen problems Spleen pain Spleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area. This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen. A damaged or ruptured spleen The spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen, car accident, sporting accident or fracture to the ribs. Rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury. Signs of a ruptured spleen are: pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss) Sometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder. A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding. Go straight to A&E if: you think you’ve ruptured or damaged your spleen Enlarged spleen The spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such as cirrhosis , leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis . ","feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach) feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs anaemia and/or fatigue frequent infections easy bleeding Doctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan ",,,"You’ll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you’ll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged. Surgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can’t be found. Splenectomy (having the spleen removed) An operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged. It may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed – a partial splenectomy. If there’s time, you’ll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation. Laparoscopy Most splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). A laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with its own light source. It is attached to a camera and will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a TV screen to guide the surgeon’s instruments. Laparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. However, you will still need a general anaesthetic. The procedure involves: making several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area) guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they’re doing passing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen – gas will be pumped into your abdomen to make this easier The incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together. You may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours. Open surgery Open surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be removed via keyhole surgery. Often, in emergencies, this will be the preferred method to rapidly control bleeding. You’ll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover. Afterwards It’s normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you’ll be given pain relief medication. You should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation. Like any operation, a splenectomy carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection. Your doctor will run through these risks with you. You should be given breathing and leg movement exercises to do at home, to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection. Another risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection, contact your GP or hospital immediately, as you may need antibiotics. Recovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving. Living without a spleen If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen’s functions. This means you will still be able to cope with most infections. However, there is a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly. This risk will be present for the rest of your life. Risk of infection Young children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small. The risk is also increased if you have a medical condition such as sickle cell anaemia , coeliac disease or a condition that affects your immune system, such as HIV . This risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection. Vaccinations Read about vaccinations for children and adults without a fully working spleen. Antibiotics It’s recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for the rest of your life to prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotics are particularly important: for children under the age of 16 for the first 2 years after your spleen is removed if your immune system doesn’t work properly Be alert for signs of infection Watch out for signs of infection, such as: high temperature (fever) sore throat cough severe headache headache with drowsiness or a rash abdominal pain redness and swelling around the surgical wound Your GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to use if you get an infection. You should start taking them at the first sign of an infection, so see your GP as soon as possible. If your infection becomes serious, you will be admitted to hospital. Animal and tick bites Bites from animals and ticks (small blood-sucking parasites) can cause infections. If you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics and seek medical advice urgently. If you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of babesiosis, which is a rare disease transmitted by ticks. Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers. If you become ill, get medical advice straight away. Telling medical staff about your condition Healthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you don’t have a working spleen. However, always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist. Carry medical ID It’s a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID. For example: if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant Travel abroad Read advice about travelling abroad without a fully working spleen. Scars The scars from your operation will gradually fade. ",
Stomach ulcer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/stomach-ulcer/,About stomach ulcers ,"Although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful. Some people experience: indigestion heartburn nausea (feeling sick) You should speak to your GP if you think you have a stomach ulcer. More about the Get urgent medical advice Speak to your GP immediately (or phone 111) if: you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse These could be a sign of a serious complication. The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy). However, some stomach ulcers aren’t painful and are only noticed when a complication develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer. Tummy pain The pain caused by a stomach ulcer can either travel: out from the middle of your tummy up to your neck down to your belly button through to your back And: can last from a few minutes to a few hours often starts within a few hours of eating can cause you to wake up during the night Taking antacids (indigestion medication) may temporarily relieve the pain, but it will keep coming back if the ulcer isn’t treated. indigestion heartburn loss of appetite feeling and being sick weight loss Some people also find they burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods. People of all ages can be infected. It’s not clear exactly why some people are more vulnerable to the effects of H. pylori bacteria than others. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) NSAIDs are medicines widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling). Commonly used NSAIDs include: ibuprofen aspirin naproxen diclofenac Many people take NSAIDs without having any side effects. But there’s always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses. You may be advised not to use NSAIDs if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you’ve had one in the past. Paracetamol is a safer painkiller to use. More about NSAIDs Lifestyle factors There’s little evidence that stomach ulcers are caused by: spicy foods stress alcohol However, smoking can: increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers urea breath test stool antigen test – a small stool sample is tested for the bacteria blood test Urea breath test You’ll be given a special drink containing a chemical that’s broken down by H. pylori. Your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an H. pylori infection. Blood test A sample of your blood’s tested for antibodies to the H. pylori bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood to help fight infection. This test’s now largely been replaced by the stool antigen test More about blood tests Gastroscopy A gastroscopy is a procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down into your stomach and first section of the small intestine (duodenum). You may: be given a mild sedative injection before the procedure have your throat sprayed with a local anaesthetic to make it more comfortable to pass the endoscope The images taken by the camera will usually confirm or rule out an ulcer. A small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum to test for the H. pylori bacteria. You’ll have this procedure as an outpatient in hospital. This means you won’t have to spend the night. You may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks to check that the ulcer’s healed. Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. Antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals. You can buy these medications at pharmacies. Your pharmacist can tell you which is most suitable for you. Side effects Side effects of both medications are usually mild, but can include: diarrhoea or constipation farting stomach cramps feeling and being sick Lifestyle changes Stomach ulcer complications Complications of stomach ulcers are rare, but can be very serious. The main complications are: internal bleeding perforation – the lining of the stomach splits open gastric outlet obstruction – the stomach ulcer obstructs the normal passage of food through your digestive system Internal bleeding Internal bleeding’s the most common complication of stomach ulcers. It can occur when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel. The bleeding can either be slow and long-term, or rapid and severe. Slow, long-term bleeding Slow, long-term bleeding can lead to anaemia. fatigue breathlessness pale skin heart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats) More about anaemia Severe bleeding you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools Stopping severe bleeding vomiting large amounts of undigested food a constant feeling of bloating or fullness feeling more full than usual after eating less food unexplained weight loss ","Stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged. This is usually caused by: an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they’re taken for a long time or at high doses More about the Stomach ulcers are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can break down the stomach’s defence against the acid it produces to digest food. The stomach lining then becomes damaged causing an ulcer to form. H. pylori bacteria H. pylori bacteria live in the stomach lining. The bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from stomach acid. ","If your GP thinks you have an ulcer, they will want to know if you’re taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might test you for an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection In some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy to look for an ulcer inside your stomach. Testing for H. pylori infection ","Stomach ulcer complications About stomach ulcers Stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers) are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. These are called duodenal ulcers. Stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. This information applies to both. You’ll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back. You’ll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) if your ulcer was caused by NSAIDs. Your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol , may be recommended. More about Complications Complications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening. The main complications include: bleeding at the site of the ulcer the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open – known as perforation the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system – known as gastric obstruction More about the complications of stomach ulcers If your stomach ulcer’s caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, you’ll be given: a course of antibiotics a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) This is also recommended if it’s thought your stomach ulcer’s caused by a combination of an H. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Antibiotics If you have an H. pylori infection, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of 2 or 3 antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics are: amoxicillin clarithromycin metronidazole You should take these twice a day for a week. Side effects The side effects of these are usually mild, but can include: feeling and being sick diarrhoea a metallic taste in your mouth Further testing You’ll be re-tested at least 4 weeks after finishing your antibiotic course to see if there are any H. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. If there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics may be given. Ulcers caused by NSAIDs If your stomach ulcer’s caused by taking NSAIDs: you’ll be given a course of PPI medication your use of NSAIDs will be reviewed, and you may be advised to use an alternative painkiller Alternative painkillers You may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such as paracetamol . COX-2 inhibitors are sometimes recommended. These are an alternative type of NSAID that’s less likely to cause stomach ulcers. Low-dose aspirin If you’re taking low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk of blood clots, your GP will tell you whether you need to keep taking it. Complications It’s important to understand the potential risks associated with continued NSAID use. You’re more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding. Read more about the complications of stomach ulcers Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. The most commonly used PPIs are: omeprazole pantoprazole lansoprazole They’re usually prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks. Side effects Side effects of these are usually mild, but can include: headaches diarrhoea or constipation feeling sick abdominal (tummy) pain dizziness rashes H2-receptor antagonists Sometimes a type of medication called H2-receptor antagonists are used instead of PPIs. These also reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. Side effects Side effects are uncommon, but can include: diarrhoea headaches dizziness rashes tiredness Antacids and alginates Antacids: neutralise your stomach acid provide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief Sometimes: specialised procedures carried out under X-ray guidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers surgery is needed to repair the affected blood vessel Blood transfusions may also be needed to replace the blood you’ve lost. Perforation Perforations are a rarer complication of stomach ulcers. This is when the lining of the stomach splits open. This can be very serious because it lets the bacteria that live in your stomach escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). This is known as peritonitis. Peritonitis In peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood ( sepsis ) before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated. The most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. If you have this type of pain, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately. Peritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. In some cases, surgery may be needed. Gastric outlet obstruction In some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can obstruct the normal passage of food through your digestive system. This is called a gastric outlet obstruction. An endoscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction. If the obstruction’s caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down. If the obstruction’s caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed. This can involve passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the obstruction. ",

Streptococcus A (strep A),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/streptococcus-a-strep-a/,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Strep A, are bacteria commonly found on the skin or in the throat. Under some circumstances these bacteria can cause disease. GAS infection commonly presents as a mild sore throat (‘strep throat’) and skin/soft tissue infections such as impetigo and cellulitis. Phone 999 or go to A&E if: you or your child is having difficulty breathing (you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs) there are pauses when you or your child breathes you or your child’s skin, tongue or lips are blue you or your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake Contact your GP if you or your child: is getting worse is feeding or eating much less than normal is showing signs of dehydration, like sunken eyes, drowsiness has not passed urine for 12 hours is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38°C is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C or higher feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty is very tired or irritable If your GP is closed, phone the 111 service. If you feel that you or your child is seriously unwell, trust your own judgement and seek medical assistance. Strep A tests are not available through the NHS in Scotland for self-testing at home. Should you or your child need to be tested for Strep A, your GP or other healthcare professional will advise you. GAS infections GAS bacteria can cause a wide variety of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. These include: tonsillitis sore throat scarlet fever impetigo erysipelas (a type of cellulitis) cellulitis pneumonia In rare cases, patients may go on to develop post-streptococcal complications, such as: rheumatic fever glomerulonephritis (heart and kidney diseases caused by an immune reaction to the bacteria)​ iGAS infections GAS can very rarely cause more serious conditions, known as invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections. These can include: bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream) septic arthritis meningitis necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin) Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome ","iGAS infections tend to happen in the elderly, the very young, or people with an underlying risk factor such as injecting drug use, alcoholism, immunosuppression or cancer. sore throats , are more commonly caused by viruses than GAS bacteria. If you or your child has a runny nose with their sore throat, it’s likely to be a virus infection. Sore throats caused by viruses do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless there are concerns about complications. Your healthcare professional will consider antibiotics if they think: you or your child are at risk of serious complications from a GAS infection you or your child has scarlet fever If you or your child is prescribed antibiotics, they could be in liquid or pill form. It’s not uncommon for someone to have GAS bacteria on their skin or in their throat without being unwell. These people often don’t know they have the bacteria and won’t need antibiotics. Preventing GAS infection GAS are spread by close contact between individuals, through respiratory droplets (moisture in your breath) and direct skin contact. To help reduce the risk of picking up or spreading infections: Do wash your hands properly with soap for 20 seconds use a disposable tissue to catch coughs and sneezes and wash your hands afterwards keep away from others if you feel unwell Don’t do not share contaminated food, utensils, cups and glasses, baths, bed linen or towels GAS can be a secondary infection, developing in people who are already unwell with illnesses like the flu. You can help protect your child from this risk by making sure they get their free flu vaccine this winter. New evidence also shows that the nasal spray flu vaccine offered to children may also protect them from GAS infection.

If operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue can be removed. Surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you’ll probably have to adjust the size of your portions. Chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. Read more about persistent indigestion trapped wind and frequent burping heartburn feeling full very quickly when eating feeling bloated after eating feeling sick pain in your stomach or breastbone difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages Advanced stomach cancer blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss tiredness lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid) anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless) yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) When to seek medical help Stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it’s diagnosed early. It’s therefore important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected. Stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age. Indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it’s unlikely that someone with indigestion who’s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer. However, see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They should refer you to a specialist for further testing. Also see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This isn’t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated. Read more about diagnosing stomach cancer In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and and refer people for the right tests faster. Find out who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer . Hospital tests If your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they’ll refer you to a specialist for tests. These may include a blood test and chest X-ray , which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood. Because of the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks. Read more about waiting times . Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end). If you need to have an endoscopy, you won’t be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty. You’ll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A local anaesthetic may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed. The endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any stomach ulcers or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a biopsy . The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back. The endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit. If your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an ultrasound scan at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb). If you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it’s passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach. After an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won’t be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a sore throat , although this should pass within a few days. Barium meal X-ray A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it’s less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers. Organs such as your stomach don’t usually show up on an X-ray because they’re made of soft tissue that isn’t dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen. You won’t able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system. A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause constipation . Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system. Further testing If you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it’s spread and how quickly it’s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you. A relatively new medication called trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer. Any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You’ll also need several weeks at home to recover. Surgery to remove your stomach You may need to have part or all of your stomach removed. Surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of your stomach, using a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy. These operations may be carried out using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under general anaesthetic , which means you’ll be unconscious throughout the procedure. During these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It’s possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning. Partial gastrectomy If your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy to remove it. After surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won’t be affected. Total gastrectomy or oesophagogastrectomy If your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may need to have an oesophagogastrectomy. If you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum. If your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery. If your stomach is blocked, there are a few options: stenting – a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under local anaesthetic ; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach bypass surgery – an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system Chemotherapy If may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both. Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks. Alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital. Side effects of chemotherapy Chemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include: tiredness nausea and vomiting nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy ) hair loss diarrhoea anaemia (a lack of red blood cells) weight loss skin changes – such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet Side effects of radiotherapy You may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy: tiredness nausea diarrhoea palliative care . Support is also available for your family and friends. ","Diagnosing stomach cancer . Types of stomach cancer There are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas. Less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall. How stomach cancer is treated Stomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it’s unclear exactly why these changes occur. Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body). Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. It’s not known what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition. Increased risk However, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your chances of developing stomach cancer. Age and gender Your risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over. For reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer. Smoking People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach. The more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking, the bigger the risk. In the UK, around 1 in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking. H. pylori infection Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as stomach ulcers , recurring bouts of indigestion or long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis). Research has found people with severe chronic atrophic gastritis have an increased risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small. Diet A diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer. Countries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK. A high fibre diet with 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer. Family history You’re more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling. It’s not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents. In around 1 in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin. You may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. bowel cancer . Having another type of cancer Your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you’ve had another type of cancer, such as cancer of the oesophagus or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer that develops in your white blood cells). For men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having prostate cancer , bladder cancer , breast cancer or testicular cancer . For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having ovarian cancer , breast cancer or cervical cancer . Certain medical conditions Having certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as pernicious anaemia (a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can’t absorb it properly), and peptic stomach ulcers (an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection). Stomach surgery If you’ve had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer. This can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer. How stomach cancer spreads There are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread: directly – the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity) through the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection through the blood – which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver Stomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer. Diagnosing stomach cancer ",,"Living with stomach cancer About stomach cancer Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a fairly uncommon type of cancer. The initial Living with stomach cancer Living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support. Read more about living with stomach cancer Laparoscopy Your specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a general anaesthetic , so you’ll be unconscious during it. During the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision. Computerised tomography or positron emission tomography scans During CT scans or PET scans , a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body. Liver ultrasound scan If your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver ultrasound . This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver. Staging and grading After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged. One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread. The majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn’t usually possible. Grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer: low-grade – the cancer tends to grow slowly medium-grade – the cancer grows a bit faster high-grade – the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly Cancer Research UK has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer. chemotherapy and radiotherapy If surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery. Surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage. If it’s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy. Surgery If you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage, it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery. In some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet), rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to remove a sample of the tumour for testing ( biopsy ). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. You may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back. If you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses beams of high energy radiation However, if you have advanced stomach cancer that’s causing pain or bleeding, you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring. If a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing anaemia , a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding. Trastuzumab Trastuzumab (sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication used to treat breast cancer and some cases of advanced stomach cancer. Some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn’t cure stomach cancer, but it can slow its growth and increase survival time. Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as angina , uncontrolled high blood pressure ( hypertension ) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems. Other side effects of trastuzumab may include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and pains Living with stomach cancer Being diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope. You may find the following advice helpful: keep talking to your friends and family – they can be a powerful support system talk to others in the same situation research your condition set reasonable goals take time out for yourself Cancer charities, such as Macmillan Cancer Support , are a good source of information and support. Recovery Getting back to normal after surgery can take time. It’s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. During your recovery, avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. You may also be advised not to drive. chemotherapy and radiotherapy , can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends. Follow-up blood tests Diet after surgery If you’ve had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. This is because your stomach won’t be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. You should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand. If you’ve had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. As with a partial gastrectomy, you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. You may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. Your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat. Having surgery to remove your stomach also means you’ll need to have regular injections of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent a condition called anaemia and nerve problems. Looking after yourself Eat regularly and healthily. You may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day. It’s understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. You may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for. Remember: you’re human, and those feelings are natural. Dealing with dying ",

Sickle cell disease,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/blood-and-lymph/sickle-cell-disease/,About sickle cell disease ,"People from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. You are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds: African Asian Caribbean Eastern Mediterranean Middle Eastern Getting immediate medical advice high temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher difficulty breathing drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness skin or lips that are very pale fits (seizures) It’s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease. Sickle cell crises Episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe. A sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are: hands or feet (this is especially common in young children) ribs and breastbone spine pelvis tummy legs and arms headaches a fast heartbeat fainting dizziness Sudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion. There’s a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include: a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever pain in bones and joints delayed puberty delayed growth in childhood kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine gallstones – these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful) priapism – a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension) transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes – these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked enlarged spleen – this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss It’s important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn’t the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don’t take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. Taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous. Blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia. Getting surgery when you have sickle cell disease If you’re due to have surgery, or you’re brought in for surgery in an emergency, it’s very important you take some precautions. You should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic. Tell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease. General anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. It’s important that you’re monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm. It might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications. Pregnancy and birth with sickle cell disease You can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it’s a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons: there’s a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you’re pregnant you may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus it may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean ","​Sickle cell disease carriers and screening About sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. The most severe is sickle cell anaemia. These disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes. You can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease. Infection Sickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren’t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis. As well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections. Anaemia Almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it’s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood. Stay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures. Don’t expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature – for example, avoid swimming in cold water. The lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you’re at high altitude for any reason. However, plane travel shouldn’t be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised. Make sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath. Don’t smoke – smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome. Stay relaxed as much as you can – sickle cell crises can be triggered by stress, so consider learning relaxation techniques like breathing exercises . Your care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. This is a capsule that is taken once a day. It works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body. This means that you’ll need regular blood tests to make sure you’re healthy. Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. It isn’t something you can catch, and it’s not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy. Inheriting sickle cell disease You inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. Genes always come in pairs. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty. This happens when both parents are “carriers” – they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait. Carriers don’t have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition. When both of a child’s parents are sickle cell carriers: there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won’t inherit any faulty genes – they won’t have sickle cell disease, and they won’t be able to pass it on to their children there’s a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they’re born You can find more information about how sickle cell disease is inherited from the Sickle Cell Society . Learn more about sickle cell carriers and screening ​Sickle cell disease carriers and screening If you have the sickle cell trait, you won’t develop sickle cell disease. However, there’s a risk that you’ll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier. Sickle cell disease carriers The sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers. You are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas : Africa Asia The Caribbean The Eastern Mediterranean The Middle East Most sickle cell carriers in the UK have an African or Caribbean family background – it’s estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier. Finding out if you are a sickle cell carrier You can request a blood test from your GP at any time to find out if you’re a sickle cell carrier. This is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene. Both men and women are able to get the test. Every pregnant woman in Scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. You can ask for a test even if your family background doesn’t suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. It’s a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too. If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease. ","Learn about being tested to see if you carry the sickle cell gene Other health risks for sickle cell carriers You’re not at risk of developing sickle cell disease if you carry sickle cell. The only time you may be at risk of health problems is in rare cases where you might not get enough oxygen, such as: having surgery under general anaesthetic – make sure your medical team know you carry sickle cell before your operation so they can ensure you get enough oxygen during extreme sports such as deep sea diving and climbing at high altitudes – if you do sports like these, ensure you’re never short of oxygen during regular, intensive physical activity – make sure you drink plenty of fluids during training and avoid extreme exhaustion There’s also a very small risk of developing kidney problems associated with carrying sickle cell. Apart from these uncommon situations, you can lead a completely normal and healthy life if you’re a sickle cell carrier. Other blood disorders Sickle cell carriers are also at risk of having a child with a blood disorder if their partner is a carrier of a different type of blood disorder. You can find more detailed information about some of the other types of carrier in the following pages: Your baby carries a gene for Sickle Cell Your baby carries a gene for unusual haemoglobin ","​Living with sickle cell disease Find out about living with sickle cell disease Find out about screening to see if you’re a sickle cell carrier sudden swelling in the tummy priapism – a painful erection lasting two hours or more weakness on one or both sides of your body sudden vision loss, or changes in your vision for more information. Diagnosing sickle cell disease You can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you’re a carrier who could have a child with the condition. Sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy – free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland. Even if your family background doesn’t make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test. If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease. Newborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test – the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this: if a baby’s parents weren’t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers here ) the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis People of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. A specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it. Sickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. The following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis: over the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help – although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 – and if needed, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers heating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain – pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this drink plenty – staying hydrated will help relaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child’s mind, from the pain If none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your GP. You or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (A&E) if it’s not possible to contact your GP. It may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief. The best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them. Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids –especially water. Children who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis B vaccine and the annual flu vaccine. If you have sickle cell disease, you’ll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. This will not pose serious health risks. Reduce risk in day-to-day life by being careful about activities that can make you vulnerable to infection. Always follow good food hygiene measures , for example. If you’re planning to go abroad, talk to your GP as far in advance as you can. You might need extra vaccinations or medication, such as anti-malarials if you’re going to a place where malaria is a risk. It may also be a good idea to take extra precautions when it comes to food and water. painkillers can treat joint and bone pain a short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty gallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones for persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having one Learn more about living with sickle cell disease here ​Living with sickle cell disease It’s important to use a reliable form of contraception if you aren’t planning a pregnancy. Learn about pregnancy and newborn screening for sickle cell disease The outlook for people with sickle cell disease Most children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. However, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it’s still a serious condition. Sickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone’s life. It can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), and lung problems, which can be fatal. The overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.

Skin cancer (melanoma),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/skin-cancer-melanoma/,About melanoma ,". These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK. Nodular melanoma Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren’t regularly exposed to the sun. Lentigo maligna melanoma Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years. Acral lentiginous melanoma Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin. Cancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma . Why does melanoma happen? Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It’s thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible. Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: lots of moles or freckles pale skin that burns easily red or blonde hair a family member who has had melanoma Read more about the chemotherapy . Read more about The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole. Normal moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and no bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months. Signs to look out for include a mole that is: getting bigger changing shape changing colour bleeding or becoming crusty itchy or painful A helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist: Asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape Border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border Colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours Diameter – melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. Enlargement or elevation – a mole that changes size over time is more likely to be a melanoma Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail. In rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . You will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within 2 weeks of seeing your GP. The dermatologist or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may also remove the mole and send it for testing ( biopsy ) to check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic , meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won’t feel any pain. If cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area of skin. Further tests Further tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream. Sentinel lymph node biopsy If melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes). Lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under general anaesthetic . A combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider area of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma. The first lymph node this reaches is known as the ‘sentinel’ lymph node. The surgeon can locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma (this process can take several weeks). If the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it’s extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it’s more likely to spread elsewhere. If the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma. Your surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but is used to investigate the outlook of your condition. An operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.

It is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend. The side effects of radiotherapy include: tiredness nausea loss of appetite hair loss sore skin Several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable. Vaccines There is ongoing research into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back. Vaccines are designed to focus the body’s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months. As more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial. Monoclonal antibodies Our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn’t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body. Antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies. Ipilimumab Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer. ","Diagnosing melanoma . Diagnosing melanoma Speak to your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma. In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy . You may also have a test to check if the melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a sentinel node biopsy. Read more about diagnosing melanoma . How is melanoma treated? Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight. Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light: ultraviolet A (UVA) ultraviolet B (UVB) ultraviolet C (UVC) UVC is filtered out by the Earth’s atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer. Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Repeated sunburn , either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages. Moles You are at an increased risk of melanoma if you have lots of moles on your body, especially if they are large (over 5mm) or unusually shaped. Having just 1 unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%. For this reason, it’s important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun. Family history Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased. Increased risk Certain things are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: pale skin that does not tan easily red or blonde hair blue eyes older age a large number of freckles Diagnosing melanoma ","Read further information: Some GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment. Seeing a specialist In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE While the surgeon will try to ensure the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as lymphoedema . Follow-up Once the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning. ","About melanoma Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed. An ‘ABCDE checklist’ has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma. Read more about the If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful. . Once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe. If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns. Who is affected Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK. More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It’s also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds. Can melanoma be prevented? Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. a condition that suppresses your immune system – such as HIV medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used after organ transplants exposure to certain chemicals – such as creosote and arsenic Melanoma stages The melanoma stages can be described as: stage 0 – the melanoma is on the surface of the skin stage 1A – the melanoma is less than 1mm thick stage 1B – the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity) stage 2A – the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick and is ulcerated stage 2B – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick and ulcerated stage 2C – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated stage 3A – the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further stage 3B – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes stage 3C – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby stage 4 – the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Cancer Research UK: Stages of melanoma Macmillan: Melanoma Stage 1 melanoma Surgical excision is usually carried out under local anaesthetic . This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won’t feel pain. In some cases, general anaesthetic is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure. If a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method. Stage 2 and 3 melanoma As with stage 1 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed. The remaining skin is either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be carried out if necessary. Sentinel node biopsy Sentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead with the procedure and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma. If the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy. Lymph nodes Stage 4 melanoma It may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has: been diagnosed at its most advanced stage spread to another part of your body (metastasis) Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Radiotherapy for melanoma . The medications currently being used include: vemurafenib ipilimumab nivolumab Chemotherapy Chemotherapy The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe. Electrochemotherapy surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t worked The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes. These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed). Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers. It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated. Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin . Immunotherapy Signalling inhibitors Signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK. There are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Biological therapy for melanoma . Cancer Research UK: Chemotherapy for melanoma . Clinical trials A clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process. There are a few key things to know about clinical trials: all clinical trials are highly regulated If you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Melanoma research . palliative care .

Supraventricular tachycardia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/heart-and-blood-vessels/conditions/supraventricular-tachycardia/,Supraventricular tachycardia is a condition where the heartbeat is abnormally fast. It can happen to anyone at any age and often occurs for the first time in children or young adults. ,"If you have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll usually feel your heart racing in your chest or throat. The heart rate is usually between 140 to 180 beats per minute but can be as high as 250. A normal heartbeat should be 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest. During a supraventricular tachycardia, the heart muscle contracts very fast. This means that it cannot relax properly between contractions to fill with blood. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body. Therefore, you may also feel: chest pain dizziness light-headedness fatigue (tiredness) breathlessness On rare occasions, you may faint because of a drop in blood pressure. Diagnosing supraventricular tachycardia If your doctor thinks that you might have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll be referred for tests. These can include an: electrocardiogram (ECG) ambulatory heart monitor echocardiogram ",stress anxiety a change in posture some medications alcohol caffeine smoking recreational drugs ,,"Why it happens Some people are born with an abnormality of the heart’s natural ‘wiring’ or conduction system. This allows a short circuit to develop. Under certain circumstances, this allows the heart to race very fast. One example of this is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome . This is where there’s an abnormal electrical connection between the: atria (upper heart chambers), and the ventricles (lower heart chambers) Some people with this condition can develop supraventricular tachycardias. This is because of this short circuit. the type of supraventricular tachycardia you have your age your overall health medication, like beta blockers and other anti-arrhythmic drugs radiofrequency ablation ",

This is known as idiopathic scoliosis. A small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including: cerebral palsy – a condition  associated with brain damage Marfan syndrome – a disorder of the connective tissues Rarely, babies can be born with scoliosis, as a result of a problem with the development of the spine in the womb. In adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis. Read more about the . Who is affected It used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it’s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented. It is not thought to be linked with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet. If the cause of scoliosis is unknown, it is called idiopathic scoliosis. About eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic. However, researchers have found there is a family history of the condition in some idiopathic cases, which suggests a possible genetic link. Idiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children. Some cases may only become noticable in later life. In a small number of cases, a cause is identified. Other health conditions Some cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular conditions), such as: cerebral palsy – a condition that affects the brain and nerves and occurs during or shortly after birth These conditions are usually diagnosed at a young age and children with them are often monitored for problems such as scoliosis. Birth defects In rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. This is known as congenital scoliosis. Congenital scoliosis is caused by the bones in the spine developing abnormally in the womb. Long-term damage In adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by gradual deterioration to the parts of the spine. This is known as degenerative scoliosis. This can occur because some parts of the spine become narrower and weaker ( osteoporosis ) with age. Diagnosing scoliosis Scoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders. You may be asked to bend forward to see if any areas are particularly prominent. For example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back. ","The X-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve. The medical name for the angle the spine curves is known as the Cobb angle. In some cases, scans such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan may also be recommended. ","Possible complications of scoliosis About scoliosis Scoliosis is the abnormal twisting and curvature of the spine. It is usually first noticed by a change in appearance of the back. Typical signs include: a visibly curved spine one shoulder being higher than the other one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other clothes not hanging properly a prominent ribcage a difference in leg lengths Back pain is common in adults with scoliosis. Young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it’s less likely to be severe. When to get professional help If you or your child have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP. They can examine your back and can refer you for an X-ray for confirmation. Read more about diagnosing scoliosis . Rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team. Phone 111 if: there has been a new, significant trauma within the last 7 days, for example a fall from height or direct blow to the back It’s more common in females than males. How scoliosis is treated If the infant or younger child’s curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows. In older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen. a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further surgery to correct the curvature – where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires Read more and . Further problems Scoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems. Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. If this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as Scoliosis Association UK . These groups are a good source of information and support for people with scoliosis. In rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it’s severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs. Read more about the possible complications of scoliosis . Scans The orthopaedic specialist will take an X-ray observation casting bracing surgery These are described below. There is a separate page about . Observation However, if the curve does not correct itself, it can reduce the space for the internal organs to develop in, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important. Your specialist will usually recommend having regular X-rays to monitor the curvature to see if it improves, stays the same, or gets worse. Casting In some cases affecting young children, the spine may need to be guided during growth in an attempt to correct the curve. In a child aged under two years of age, this can sometimes be achieved by using a cast. A cast is an external brace to the trunk made out of a lightweight combination of plaster and modern casting materials. The cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but is changed regularly to allow for growth and remodelling. The cast will be changed under anaesthetic Bracing If the curve of your child’s spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they are growing. A brace cannot cure scoliosis or correct the curve, but it may stop the curve from getting worse. However, while there is some evidence bracing may be of benefit in certain cases, it’s not recommended by all scoliosis specialists. If a brace is used, it will need to be carefully fitted to your child’s spine. To do this, a cast of your child’s back may need to be taken. This can be done as an outpatient which means that your child will not have to stay overnight in hospital. Braces are often made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available. In general, modern back braces are designed so they are difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing. It’s usually recommended that the brace is worn for 23 hours a day, and is only removed for baths and showers. The brace should not interfere with normal everyday activity and can be worn during most non-contact sports. However, it should be removed during contact sports and swimming. Regular exercise is important for children wearing a brace. This helps improve muscle tone and body strength, and will help make wearing the brace more comfortable. The brace will usually have to be worn for as long as your child’s body is still growing. For most children, this will mean they can stop wearing it when they are around 16 or 17 years old. Surgery Surgery in children For younger children, generally those under the age of ten, an operation may be carried out to insert growing rods. These rods aim to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine while partially correcting the scoliosis. After surgery to insert the rods, your child will need to return to their specialist every 4-6 months to have the rods lengthened to keep up with the child’s growth. This procedure will be done through a small incision, and takes place often as a day case or an overnight stay. In some cases, rods that can be lengthened using external magnets during an outpatient appointment may be used. Many children will also have to wear a brace to protect the growth rods. When your child stops growing, the adjustable rods can be removed and a spinal fusion (see below) will be carried out. Surgery in teenagers and young adults In teenagers and young adults whose spine has stopped growing, an operation called a spinal fusion may be carried out. This is a major operation where the spine is straightened using metal rods attached with screws, hooks, and/or wires, and bone grafts are used to fuse the spine in place. This metalwork will usually be left in place permanently, unless they cause any problems. The surgery will take several hours. After surgery, your child will be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU), where they will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously) and pain relief. Most children are well enough to leave intensive care after a day or two, although they will often need to spend another five to 10 days in hospital. After the operation, most children can return to school after a few weeks and can play sports after a few months. Contact sports should be avoided for 9-12 months. Occasionally a back brace may need to be worn to protect the metal rods after surgery. Risks of surgery Spinal fusion surgery is a major operation which, like any surgical procedure carries a risk of complications. It will not be recommended unless the surgeon feels the benefits outweigh these risks. Some of the main risks the spinal fusion procedure include: bleeding – if this is severe your child may need a blood transfusion wound infection – this can usually be treated with antibiotics the implants moving or the grafts failing to fuse properly – additional surgery may be required to correct this in rare cases, damage to the nerves in the spine – this can lead to permanent numbness in the legs, and can sometimes cause paralysis of the legs and loss of control of the bowels and bladder Additional therapies There is no reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic can be used to correct the curvature of the spine or stop it progressing. The role of scoliosis specific exercises is currently under investigation. Physiotherapy  may be beneficial when used in combination with a back brace. Exercise can help significantly with any muscular pain experienced with scoliosis, and back health in general. In some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the shape of the spine as a way of helping with back and leg pains. Medication Painkilling medication is usually recommended to help relieve the pain that can be associated with scoliosis. Over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen , are often recommended initially. See your GP if these don’t work. They may prescribe stronger painkillers or refer you to a specialist pain management clinic. In some cases, corticosteroids or local anaesthetic may be injected into your back to relieve pain caused by the bones in your spine compressing or irritating nearby nerves. However, these injections only work in the short-term and are mostly useful in helping work out where your pain is coming from. If it’s thought that osteoporosis . Exercise General strengthening and stretching exercises can improve your general posture and flexibility, and may help control any back pain. Exercises can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which can reduce the strain on your back. Some people may benefit from physiotherapy, where they are taught specific exercises to carry out. Bracing Braces are not often used to treat scoliosis in adults, although they can provide pain relief in some cases. A brace may be considered as an alternative to surgery if you are not well enough to undergo an operation. Surgery Surgery for adults with scoliosis is usually only recommended if the curve in the spine is severe, if it’s getting significantly worse, for back pain related to standing in an abnormal posture, or if the nerves in the spine are being compressed. There are two types of surgery: decompression surgery – if a disc or bone is pressing down on a nerve, it can be removed to reduce the pressure on the nerve spinal fusion surgery – where the position of the spine is improved using metal rods, plates and screws before being fused into place using bone grafts These are major operations and it can take up to a year or more to fully recover from them. They also carry a risk of potentially serious complications, including: failure to reduce pain – surgery is generally better at relieving pain that radiates to the legs, rather than back pain the implants becoming displaced, broken or loose infection blood clots rarely, damage to the nerves in the spine – in severe cases this can result in permanent leg numbness and the loss of bladder or bowel control Read more about lumbar decompression surgery . Possible complications of scoliosis Physical complications of scoliosis are rare, although serious problems can develop if it’s left untreated. Emotional issues Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace may cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. Modern back braces are designed to be difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing, but your child may still worry that they look different or unusual. Encouraging your child to talk with other teenagers who have scoliosis can help improve their confidence and lessen any feelings they are alone with their condition. There are several support groups, such as the Scoliosis Association UK , that provide information and support for people with scoliosis. Some also host message boards so teenagers from across the world can compare experiences, share tips and exchange messages of encouragement. Lung and heart problems In particularly severe cases of scoliosis the ribcage can be pushed against the heart and lungs, causing breathing problems and making it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body. This can also increase the chances of lung infections, such as pneumonia , and lead to problems such as heart failure . Nerve compression In some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. In severe cases, this can cause problems such as: back and leg pain numbness or weakness in the legs When to get professional help Rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.

Stillbirth,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/pregnancy-and-childbirth/stillbirth/,"A stillbirth is when a baby dies after the 24th week of a pregnancy or during birth. It’s a devastating experience for parents and can affect you and your family in ways you don’t expect. How you might be feeling Your emotions will likely be in turmoil and you might feel angry, guilty, sad and lonely but also love and pride. There’s no right or wrong way to feel. If you already have children, think about how they might be feeling too and what support they’ll need. This is a very difficult time for you and everyone close to you so it’s important to support each other and ask for help if you need it. ",,"Some are linked to problems with the placenta or mum’s health and others to the baby’s health or development but in some cases the reason can’t be explained. Although there are many reasons that a stillbirth can happen, you can decrease the risk by maintaining a health lifestyle before and during pregnancy. Read more about living a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy Death during pregnancy If your baby dies before birth, labour is usually induced. Going through labour and giving birth is the safest option for most women, even though it can be very distressing. It’s natural to want to know why this happened. It’s not always possible to know why your baby died and that can be hard to come to terms with. Your midwife and obstetrician will be there to support you through it. They will tell you what to expect and give you whatever help you need. Should I hold my baby? Your midwife or doctor will ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby. You might want to involve other members of your family too. If you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Many parents find it comforting to see, touch and hold their baby and, if you want to, you can bath and dress them. Cuddle cot Your midwife can talk to you about a Cuddle Cot, a special cooling mattress inside a cot which can let you spend more time with your baby in the hospital or at home. This gives you more time to say goodbye, with the support of family and friends. If the hospital doesn’t have a Cuddle Cot then there are other organisations that can organise one for bereaved parents. Ask your midwife. After a stillbirth What you choose to do is very personal and individual, as is the way you grieve. Specialist help and support is available for parents and families who have lost a baby and your midwife, family nurse and health visitor can help you to find the right support locally. Registering a stillbirth Your baby’s stillbirth must be registered. Your midwife and the hospital staff can advise you how to do this. You can’t officially register a baby lost before 24 weeks of pregnancy, but some hospitals will give you a certificate in memory of your baby if you ask. More about registering the death of a baby Funeral arrangements You’ll need time to think what you’d like for your baby’s funeral. This could be a burial or cremation with a service in the style of your choice. Take as much time as you need to decide on the right way to say goodbye. All hospitals in Scotland will offer a funeral service for your baby free of charge or you may choose to make your own private arrangements, which can give you more choice and control. More about funeral arrangements Coping with the loss of a baby Everyone reacts differently to the loss of a baby. Your emotions might be overwhelming and you might feel physically drained too. Take time to rest and look after yourself. It’s important to know you are not alone and have done nothing wrong. More about coping with the loss of a baby Post-mortem If you lost your baby after 13 weeks, you’ll be offered a post-mortem (autopsy). This is a medical investigation to try to understand what happened and find out if there are issues that could affect a future pregnancy Whether or not to have a post-mortem can be a difficult decision and you’ll be given support and time to think it over. If you have questions or worries, ask the person who discusses the post-mortem with you. Recovering from a stillbirth You will need care from your midwife and doctor to make sure your body is recovering. Your midwife will assist you through all the decisions you need to make and help you to find the right support. You don’t have to manage alone and it can sometimes help to talk with others who have been through baby loss. You, your baby’s father or your partner and your family are likely to need time to grieve. Remembering your baby Some parents find it helps to do something to remember their baby, like: creating a space in their garden saying a prayer writing a poem Others keep photographs, handprints or footprints, or locks of their baby’s hair in a memory box. No matter what stage of pregnancy your loss is, you can make a memory box – ask your midwife about this. Some hospitals give special boxes to parents just for this. Some parents don’t want to do any of these things, and that’s okay too. There’s no right or wrong way.

If your GP suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist. If you’re diagnosed with a sarcoma and you’re not already seeing a specialist, you’ll be referred to one. You’ll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff. Your hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests, which Macmillan have information on: X-rays bone scans ultrasound scans MRI , CT or PET scans biopsies bone marrow tests You won’t necessarily need all of these tests. Further tests If the tests show that you have a sarcoma, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. Macmillan have information on these, including: blood tests tests to check your heart is healthy, including an echocardiogram or electrocardiogram (ECG), or a nuclear medicine scan (MUGA scan) tests to check your kidneys are healthy, which can involve blood tests or having your wee (urine) collected for a period of time or a nuclear medicine blood test (GFR) ","People often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this. Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer. Types of soft tissue sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma This type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk. There are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg. To find out more look at Macmillan’s rhabdomyosarcoma information that is written for all ages. Synovial Sarcoma This type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore. Soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma If you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone. You can read more about this in Macmillan’s bone cancer section. Fibrosarcoma This type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together – like your muscles to bones. You’re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body. If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general soft tissue sarcoma information. The soft tissue The soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. Soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels. Types of soft tissue sarcoma Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are: rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas fibrosarcomas There are also bone sarcomas. Doctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that’s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope. Rhabdomyosarcomas These develop from muscle and the surrounding tissue. There are 2 main types that affect younger people: alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in teenagers and young adults and are usually found in an arm or leg (limb), or in the muscles of the chest or tummy (abdomen) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in children and can start in a number of areas, for example, around the eye, where the throat joins with the nose, the bladder, the womb, or the vagina Synovial sarcomas These usually develop near to but not inside joints, such as the knee or elbow. But they can develop anywhere in the body. They usually appear as hard lumps. Fibrosarcomas These start in cells called fibrocytes, which form the tissue that helps join parts of our body together, such as joining the muscles to the bones. Fibrosarcomas are usually found in the arms, legs or torso, but can also start in areas deeper in the body. The information in this section covers the common types of soft tissue sarcoma, but if you have a different one and want to know more, please contact Macmillan . Remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer. Some rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. You would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions. People who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life – this would be from their teens onwards. People often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this. If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general soft tissue sarcoma information. Tests for soft tissue sarcomas There are some tests you might have at your GP surgery or at the hospital. These tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma. Visiting your GP ",,"Living with a soft tissue sarcoma Introduction This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma. There are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. The information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. These are the most common types in teenagers. If you have a different type and want to know more, contact Macmillan . If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general soft tissue sarcoma section. Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are: rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma fibrosarcomas Sarcomas can also develop in the bones. This is called osteosarcoma. Having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends and your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general soft tissue sarcoma information. If you have a different type and want to know more, please contact Macmillan . the type of sarcoma you have the stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started) the grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are). If you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone. Chemotherapy This is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations: before surgery – to shrink the tumour after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line. You can find out more about chemotherapy and how it’s given. You’ll have chemotherapy over a few days, then you’ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. Some of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are: ifosfamide vincristine actinomycin D doxorubicin cyclophosphamide cisplatin If you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. Giving these drugs together is called IVA. You might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. Giving these drugs together is called IVADO. Macmillan have more information about chemotherapy , including information about individual drugs and combinations of drugs , IVA and IVADO chemotherapy. This is written for anyone who’s looking for information about chemotherapy, not just for young adults. Other types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you’re going to have and how many cycles you’ll need. Side effects Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It’s hard to know how it’s going to be for you, as everyone is different. The most common are hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection. If you want to know more about the type of chemotherapy you’re having and its side effects, there’s lots more information in Macmillan’s chemotherapy section . Surgery The operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. You might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. Everyone is different. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what’s involved. Below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma. We also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section. Wide local excision You may have an operation called a wide local excision to remove the cancer and an area of tissue surrounding it (called the margin). This tissue is checked to make sure it doesn’t contain any cancer cells. Sometimes the surgeon also removes some of the lymph nodes (glands) near the cancer to find out if there are any cancer cells there. If there are cancer cells in the margin or lymph nodes, some people may need to have more surgery. Skin graft or soft tissue graft If you need to have a large area of tissue removed, you may need to have a skin graft or soft tissue graft. This is when skin and sometimes muscle is taken from a different part of the body to place over the area where the sarcoma was removed from. This is called plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery. It’s done to give you as natural an appearance as possible and to make sure you can still do the things you did before your operation. Both operation sites will gradually heal over a few weeks after the operation. Limb-sparing surgery If the sarcoma is in an arm or leg you may have limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon takes away the cancer without removing the arm or leg. You’ll have all of the tumour taken away from your limb, as well as any bone and muscle affected by the tumour. The surgeon then replaces what they’ve taken away. This may involve using plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery (see skin graft or soft tissue graft) to replace the tissue that’s been removed, or it may involve surgery to replace any bone that’s been removed. If you need to have bone removed, the surgeon replaces it with a specially designed metal implant called an endoprosthesis. If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, your joint can be replaced with an artificial one. Before the operation Your physiotherapist might give you exercises before your operation to strengthen your muscles. If you want to have a look at the endoprosthesis that will be put in during your surgery, your nurse or surgeon can usually arrange this. After the operation You’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it still and let it heal. You’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days or when there isn’t very much fluid coming out of the wound. You won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein. You’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 to 3 days. As time goes on you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. Be honest about how you are feeling to your doctors and nurses and they can make sure that you are comfortable and as pain-free as possible. Once you’re home you’ll probably feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems it’s important to get them treated right away, as a delay could mean they get much more serious. If your new joint starts to stiffen up you may need some more physiotherapy, so tell your doctor so they can arrange this for you. There’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma . Amputation Very occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. This is called an amputation and it’s only ever done if there is no alternative. Before the operation Your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and you might want to talk to a specialist nurse or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who has had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It’s really important to get support. After the operation You’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a drain coming from the wound to remove any excess fluid that builds up. The drain is usually taken out by a nurse on the ward after 3 to 4 days or when there is no fluid coming from the wound. You’ll also be given fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again. You’ll probably feel a bit sore after your operation, especially for the first 2 to 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the doctors and nurses if you need extra pain relief. You may have pain that feels as if it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as phantom pain. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time. A physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible. If you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days. Once you’re up and around you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger. It’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis (artificial limb) until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and you’ll start learning how to use it in physiotherapy. A specialist team will help you recover from the operation and get you used to the artificial limb that you’re fitted with. You’ll be able to go home about two weeks after your operation. You can read more about recovering after the operation in our information about living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma . Remember that it may be possible to talk to someone who has been through the same as you. Your doctor or nurse can arrange this. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. There’s more information about it in the radiotherapy section. For soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations: after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you’ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed before surgery – to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation Side effects Other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help. If you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general soft tissue sarcoma information. Living with a soft tissue sarcoma This information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. You may find it useful to read the information about surgery first. Life after limb-sparing surgery The long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon. After limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them. Joint replacements If you’ve had a joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint. Check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do. If you’ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. After any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. It’s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible. Life after amputation After amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports. Different types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics. How will I feel? You might feel lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. You might think you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it’s important that you get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to: family or friends a counsellor – this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse other young people in a similar situation Things will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available. Other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with, too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful. Try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. You might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind.

Swollen glands,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/glands/swollen-glands/,Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection. Swollen lymph glands that are caused by an infection usually get better by themselves in 1 to 2 weeks. Sometimes swollen lymph glands can have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor.

Swollen lymph glands are rarely caused by anything more serious. Managing swollen glands at home Do drink plenty of fluids rest use over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen ,"What swollen lymph glands feel like The lymph glands can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease. Swollen glands feel like tender, painful lumps.

Soft tissue sarcomas,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/soft-tissue-sarcomas/,"Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs. Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms and the trunk (torso). There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example: leiomyosarcomas – which develop in muscle tissue liposarcomas – which develop in fat tissue angiosarcomas – which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) – which can develop in the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system Soft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK. ","For example, a tumour near the stomach may cause abdominal (tummy) pain , a feeling of fullness and constipation , whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a cough or breathlessness . Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas If your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma. In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . a biopsy – where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory imaging tests – a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out Read further information: Macmillan Cancer Support: soft tissue sarcomas Sarcoma UK: what is sarcoma? ","Cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours. age – soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older certain genetic conditions – some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas previous radiotherapy ",,"exposure to certain chemicals – exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas One particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called Kaposi’s sarcoma – which develops in skin cells – is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV ). surgery – to remove any tumours radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells Surgery It involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind. Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part. But there is a possibility you’ll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage. In a small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg. Radiotherapy Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy Chemotherapy Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed. Chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body’s cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body.

Threadworms,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/threadworms/,About threadworms ,"Read more about the . When to seek professional advice Threadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them. However, they can cause intense itching around the anus (and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. This can disturb sleep. In some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1cm long. ","If the eggs get stuck on the person’s fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. If other people touch an infected surface, they can then transfer the eggs to their mouth. Threadworm eggs can survive for up to 2 weeks before hatching. If the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. Eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. After 2 weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again. Read more about . A threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs. A female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina. The female threadworm also releases mucus, which can cause an itchy bottom . Scratching the anus or vagina, or wiping them after going to the toilet, can cause the eggs to stick to your fingertips or under your fingernails. If you don’t wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. If someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then touches their mouth, they’ll become infected. After the eggs have been swallowed they pass into a person’s intestine, where they hatch. After about 2  weeks the threadworms will have grown into adults, at which point they’ll reproduce and the cycle of infection will start again. Transferring eggs Threadworm eggs can be transferred from your anus (or vagina) to anything you touch, including: bed sheets and bed clothes flannels and towels children’s toys kitchen utensils toothbrushes furniture kitchen or bathroom surfaces Threadworm eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks. As well as being swallowed by a person who touches a contaminated object or surface, threadworm eggs can also be swallowed after being breathed in. This can happen if the eggs become airborne – for example, after shaking a contaminated towel or bed sheet. Animals and pets Threadworms only infect humans and aren’t spread in animal faeces. However, there’s a small risk that threadworms can be caught from pets if the animal’s fur becomes contaminated with eggs after an infected person strokes it. If another person then touches the animal’s fur, the eggs could be passed on to them. Who’s at risk? Threadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children. People who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. This is why all members of a household need to be treated when someone has a threadworm infection. Read more about ",,"About threadworms Threadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans. Threadworms are a common type of worm infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of 10. The worms are white and look like small pieces of thread. You may notice them around your child’s bottom or in their poo. Search for a pharmacy near you If you think you or your child may have threadworms, you can usually treat the infection yourself with medication available at pharmacies without a prescription. Severe or persistent threadworm infections can cause: loss of appetite weight loss skin infection around the anus if bacteria enter any scratches caused by itching – wearing cotton gloves while sleeping may help prevent this difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep (insomnia) bedwetting In such cases, you should seek further advice from your GP. In very rare cases, threadworms can spread outside the intestine to the urinary tract or liver, or the vagina or womb in girls or women. How threadworms are spread If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. This is also often the case for young children. Read more about . Preventing threadworms It’s not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same. Children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean. If your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others. . The main medication used to treat threadworms is available from your local pharmacy without a prescription. However, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions as it isn’t suitable for everyone. Medication Mebendazole is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or prescribed by your GP. It’s available as a chewable tablet or a liquid. Mebendazole works by preventing the threadworms absorbing sugar, which means they should die within a few days. This medication is 90 to 100% effective at killing the threadworms, but it doesn’t kill the eggs. This is why the hygiene measures outlined below should also be followed for 6 weeks. In rare cases, mebendazole can cause abdominal pain or diarrhoea , particularly if the threadworm infection is severe. Hygiene measures Strict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection. The lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6 weeks, so it’s important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. Everyone in the household must follow the advice outlined below. wash all night clothes, bed linen, towels and soft toys when you’re first diagnosed – this can be done at normal temperatures, but make sure the washing is well rinsed thoroughly vacuum and dust the whole house, paying particular attention to the bedrooms – this should be repeated regularly carefully clean the bathroom and kitchen by damp-dusting surfaces and washing the cloth frequently in hot water – this should be repeated regularly avoid shaking any material that may be contaminated with eggs, such as clothing or bed sheets – this will prevent eggs being transferred to other surfaces don’t eat food in the bedroom – you may end up swallowing eggs that have been shaken off the bedclothes keep your fingernails short – encourage other members of your household to do the same discourage nail-biting and sucking fingers – in particular, make sure children don’t suck their thumb wash your hands frequently and scrub under your fingernails – it’s particularly important to do this before eating, after going to the toilet, and before and after changing your baby’s nappy wear close-fitting underwear at night and change your underwear every morning bathe or shower regularly – it’s particularly important to bathe or shower first thing in the morning: make sure you clean around your anus and vagina to remove any eggs ensure everyone in your household has their own face flannel and towel – don’t share towels keep toothbrushes in a closed cupboard and rinse them thoroughly before use Children can easily pick up another threadworm infection from friends or at school, so maintaining good hygiene may help prevent reinfection. Pregnant or breastfeeding women Medication isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Instead, you should follow the hygiene measures above. See your GP if you’re more than 3 months pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding and you continue to experience problems after only taking hygiene measures. In certain circumstances, your GP may consider prescribing medication. Children under 2 years old Make sure you wash your baby’s bottom gently but thoroughly every time you change their nappy. Also wash your hands thoroughly before and after changing their nappy. Mebendazole isn’t licensed for use in children under 2 years of age, but GPs may decide to prescribe it off-label for children over 6 months. If medication isn’t used, the hygiene measures outlined above are recommended instead. ",
Thirst,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/thirst/,About thirst About thirst Feeling thirsty all the time and for no good reason isn’t normal and should be investigated by your GP. Thirst is normally just the brain’s way of warning that you’re dehydrated because you’re not drinking enough fluid. But excessive and persistent thirst (known as polydipsia) could be a sign of an underlying problem such as diabetes . ,"Diabetes is a lifelong condition that makes it difficult to control the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The high levels of glucose can mean your kidneys need to produce more urine to help pass the glucose out of your body. This can make you feel thirsty because your brain is telling you to drink more to make up for the fluids you’ve lost. Pregnancy Feeling thirsty, as well as urinating more often than usual, is a common symptom in pregnancy and usually nothing to worry about. Very occasionally, these problems can be a sign of gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy). You should be screened for this as part of your antenatal care if you’re at risk. Medication Excessive thirst can sometimes be a side effect of certain types of medication, including lithium, certain antipsychotics and diuretics (water tablets). If you think a particular medicine is causing your thirst, it may be possible to change to a different medicine or reduce your dose. Speak to your GP about this. ","Dehydration You will usually feel thirsty because you’re not drinking the amount of fluid your body needs. This may be because you’ve been sweating heavily or you’ve lost fluid because you have diarrhoea and are vomiting . You can soon quench your thirst and restore the fluid balance in your body by having a drink and ensuring you remain well hydrated. It’s particularly important to stay well hydrated during hot weather, while exercising and while you’re unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea. Food In some cases, thirst may be caused by something as simple as a recent meal or snack. Eating salty or spicy foods can cause you to suddenly feel thirsty. Diabetes diabetes insipidus – a condition caused by problems with a hormone that regulates the amount of fluid in the body diabetic ketoacidosis – a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of the hormone insulin in the body sickle cell aneamia – an inherited blood disorder psychogenic polydipsia – where a person with a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia , drinks excessive amounts of water that can’t be excreted (got rid of) by the kidneys excessive bleeding ",,,
Syphilis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/syphilis/,British Sign Language (BSL) | 简体中文 | Polski | Română | slovenčina Syphilis is a bacterial infection. It’s hard to detect and is one of the most easily caught sexually transmitted infections (STIs). ,"Syphilis usually has 3 stages. The first stage (primary syphilis) Ten days to 3 months after infection, you may notice a small, painless sore or ulcer. This is typically on either the: penis vagina anus rectum tongue lips You might only have 1 sore, but can have more. Swelling in your lymph glands (such as in the neck, groin or armpit) often happens with the ulcers. The sore will then disappear within 2 to 6 weeks. If left untreated, syphilis will move into its second stage. The second stage (secondary syphilis) a non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet tiredness headaches swollen lymph glands fever weight loss patchy hair loss joint pains stroke dementia loss of co-ordination numbness paralysis blindness deafness heart disease skin rashes At this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death. Testing for syphilis If you think you might have syphilis, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service contacting your GP practice for an appointment What does a syphilis test involve? ",,,"The third stage (tertiary syphilis) Antibiotics will treat the syphilis infection, even during pregnancy. These are given by injection, tablets or capsules. Syphilis and pregnancy In Scotland, pregnant women are tested for syphilis as part of their antenatal checks . If you’re pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they’re born. This is known as congenital syphilis. Having syphilis during pregnancy can increase the risk of: miscarriage premature birth stillbirth How syphilis is passed on You can get syphilis by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Around one third of all people who get syphilis do so through having unprotected oral sex with no other vaginal or anal sex involved. It can also be passed by coming into contact with an ulcer on your partners penis, vagina, anus or inside their mouth. Syphilis can be passed on: to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis) by injecting drugs with a needle that’s been used by someone who has syphilis during a blood or organ transplant (this is extremely rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis) Syphilis also makes HIV easier to pass on and catch. The number of people getting syphilis in Scotland has greatly increased over the last 5 years. You could be at higher risk if you: are a man who has sex with men have had sex overseas have had multiple sexual partners How to prevent syphilis The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex . This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. Other STIs If you have been diagnosed with syphilis you should get tested for all STIs including: HIV chlamydia gonorrhoea Find your local sexual health clinic ",
Testicular lumps and swellings,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive/testicular-lumps-and-swellings/,"Lumps and swellings in the testicles (balls) are relatively common in boys, men and anyone with testicles.

Testicular cancer: Teenagers and young adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-teenagers-and-young-adults/testicular-cancer-teenagers-and-young-adults/,The testicles Having tests for testicular cancer ,"If your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they’ll examine your testicles. They might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. This uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles. At the hospital If you need more tests you’ll be referred to a hospital. This could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital. You’ll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests: blood tests to check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers – some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these an ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven’t already had one) – this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid) Removing a testicle If your ultrasound shows the lump is almost certainly cancer, an operation to remove a testicle (orchidectomy) is done. You’ll only have this operation if it’s necessary. Your specialist will explain this to you. After the operation a doctor will use a microscope to look for cancer cells in the removed testicle. This may be the only operation you need. It will not stop you having sex or becoming a dad in the future. Further tests If testicular cancer is diagnosed you will need some other tests: more blood tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working, and to check your tumour markers again chest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy – this is sometimes done before the operation CT , MRI , or PET scans to find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of your abdomen (tummy), or to anywhere else in your body ",,,"The testicles It can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. Understanding more about what they do might help. Facts about testicles Testicles are small and oval-shaped. They hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum. From puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. This gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. You also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection. The testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13 to 14 years old) onwards. When sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy. The testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body. Sperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. At ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. They go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through). Lymph nodes (glands) Lymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. We have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. They are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections. Sometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). You’ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes. If you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section . Having tests for testicular cancer You may have tests done by your GP or at the hospital. They will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer. Visiting your GP Having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. If you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section . Surgery Surgery You may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect. The surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. The testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut. During the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you’ll look the same as before. Your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. If this wasn’t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. It is a small operation to put this in later on. After the operation You’ll have a small dressing where the cut was made. This can usually be removed a day or so after the operation. The stitches in the wound will dissolve by themselves over the next few months. You’ll probably feel a bit sore and you’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if they’re not controlling the pain. Wearing fitted briefs or shorts that support you and loose trousers like jogging bottoms can feel more comfortable after your operation. You’ll probably feel tired and need to take things easy for about a week. You can expect to make a quick recovery after this operation. If one of your testicles is removed, you will still be able to have sex and make someone pregnant. Your other testicle should produce enough of the hormone testosterone and sperm. It isn’t common to have both testicles removed. If you’ve had this done then you’ll be prescribed testosterone so you’ll still be able to have sex. But you won’t be making sperm now, so you won’t be able to make someone pregnant through sex. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking before your surgery. Storing your sperm before the operation can help you to become a dad in the future. Our sections on sex and relationships and fertility have more information as well as ways of coping. Surveillance Going to all your surveillance appointments is really important. You could put a reminder in your phone. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. You might be given chemotherapy: after the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back to destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle if the cancer comes back occasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spread Chemotherapy can affect your fertility. Before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. This is called sperm banking. We have more information about fertility issues. Chemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. You have your chemotherapy through one of the following: a fine tube called a cannula a line into a vein in the chest (called a central line) a line into the arm (PICC line) that leads into a vein in the chest Find out more about how chemotherapy is given . The amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. If the stage is low then you will have 1 to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. If the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you’ll usually have 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. Giving these drugs together is called BEP. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn’t going away completely with BEP, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given. Side effects Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. You will probably have a few side effects, but it’s hard to know exactly how it’s going to be you. Your doctor will do everything they can to treat any side effects you have. hair loss tiredness feeling sick or being sick (which can be controlled with medicines) being more at risk of getting an infection There’s more information in the chemotherapy section . Sometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, although chemotherapy usually only affects fertility for a year or so, sometimes it’s permanent. Read Macmillan’s fertility section for more information. Further surgery If the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy area are still swollen after chemotherapy, they’re usually removed with an operation. Lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. The lymph nodes in the tummy are called the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, so the operation is called a ‘retroperitoneal lymph node dissection’. The operation will be done by experienced surgeons in specialist centres. The lymph nodes might contain cells that could become cancerous in the future, so having them removed is the only certain way to find this out. You might be in hospital for up to 10 days. The surgeon usually makes a cut from the top of your tummy (near your breastbone) to below your belly button. This leaves you with a scar but it’ll gradually fade until it ends up looking like a fine line. Sometimes you have surgery to remove any abnormal cells in areas like the lung or the lymph nodes in the chest. After the operation You’ll have a drip in your arm to give you fluids until you’re able to eat and drink normally. You’ll also have drainage tubes from the wound to stop any extra fluid collecting. The nurses will keep a check on the dressing over your wound and change it when needed. You’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Your staples (like metal stitches) are removed 7 to 10 days after the operation. It might take a few months to get back to the level of fitness you had before. This operation can affect your fertility, because the nerves that control the release of sperm (ejaculation) may be damaged by surgery. Surgeons use ‘nerve-sparing’ techniques to try to stop this happening. The operation doesn’t usually stop you getting an erection or having an orgasm. If you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section . Being diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you’ve finished . How will I feel? Try not to let this put you off talking about things. It can be really helpful to let someone know how you’re feeling, so that you don’t bottle things up. Sex and fertility If only 1 of your testicles has been removed, the one left should continue to make sperm and produce enough testosterone so that your fertility is not affected. You can still have sex. If you have chemotherapy, your ability to produce sperm might be affected. After chemotherapy you can have a sample checked to see if this has happened. You can still have sex, but when you are on chemotherapy (and for a few months afterwards) you should always wear a condom to protect your partner from the chemotherapy. If you had an operation to remove both of your testicles or the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy (abdomen), your fertility and your ability to have sex may be affected. This is a really tough thing to cope with on top of everything else that you’re going through. Your specialist nurse will provide support and help you find more advice and support if you feel you need it. There are things which can be done to help so that you can still have sex.

If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should read our advice on dental emergencies . Tooth decay can occur when acid is produced from plaque, which builds up on your teeth. If plaque is allowed to build up, it can lead to further problems, such as dental caries (holes in the teeth), gum disease or dental abscesses , which are collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums. ","Tooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have: toothache – either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause tooth sensitivity – you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet grey, brown or black spots appearing on your teeth bad breath an unpleasant taste in your mouth Seeing a dentist ","Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque. When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time. If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities. Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up. ",,"For early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay. Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. This involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole. If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture , bridge or implant. NHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April. Preventing tooth decay Although tooth decay is a common problem, it’s often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should: visit your dentist regularly – your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed – some medications can also contain sugar, so it’s best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible look after your teeth and gums – brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day avoid smoking or drinking alcohol excessively – tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean, and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel see your dentist or GP if you have a persistently dry mouth Read: how to keep your teeth clean reading food labels Protecting your child’s teeth Establishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged. It’s important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist can show you how to do this. Younger children should use a children’s toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it. Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.

Thyroid cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/thyroid-cancer/,About thyroid cancer ,"unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks a sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better a lump elsewhere in your neck If you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer. About 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous. Read more about the The thyroid gland The thyroid gland consists of 2 lobes located on either side of the windpipe. Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body). The thyroid gland releases 3 separate hormones: triiodothyronine – known as T3 thyroxine – known as T4 calcitonin The T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body’s metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt). An excess of T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you may lose weight. If you don’t have enough of these hormones, you’ll feel sluggish and you may gain weight. Calcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones. Calcitonin isn’t essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium. Types of thyroid cancer There are 4 main types of thyroid cancer. They are: papillary carcinoma – this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10 (60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women follicular carcinoma – accounts for around 3 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults medullary thyroid carcinoma – accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5% to 8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma can run in families anaplastic thyroid carcinoma – this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1 in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60 Papillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they’re often treated in the same way. How common is thyroid cancer? Thyroid cancer is a rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK. It’s most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It’s unclear why this is, but it may be a result of the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system. The main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck just below your Adam’s apple, which is usually painless. Women also have Adam’s apples, but they’re much smaller and less prominent than a man’s. The lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection. unexplained hoarseness that doesn’t get better after a few weeks a sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better pain in your neck When to seek medical advice You should always speak to your GP if you develop a swelling or lump at the front of your neck. Although it’s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it’s important that it is investigated. About 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called goitres. Goitres A goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as: too much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones – this is known as having an overactive thyroid gland , or hyperthyroidism not enough T3 and T4 hormones – this is known as having an underactive thyroid gland , or hypothyroidism Thyroid cancer support The Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer. As well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on 01207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm. Thyroid function test A blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland. It will rule out conditions such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems. A thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood. Further tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally. Fine-needle aspiration cytology Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. It’s an outpatient procedure, which means you won’t have to spend the night in hospital. A small needle is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. The sample is then studied under a microscope. This test can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have. Further testing In most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn’t usually achievable. This is because it’s usually spread to other parts of the body by the time it’s been diagnosed. (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin. To compensate, you’ll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life. Calcium levels Occasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. The parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood. If your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose. You’ll need to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. As a precaution, you’ll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren’t exposed to radiation. You won’t be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum. Possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea vomiting tiredness loss of appetite hair loss mouth ulcers If you’re receiving chemotherapy, you’ll also be more vulnerable to infection. See your GP if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38C (100.4F). Targeted therapies A number of targeted therapies are being tested in clinical trials to treat advanced cases of: medullary thyroid cancers differentiated thyroid cancers that don’t respond to radioactive iodine anaplastic thyroid carcinomas In targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread. ","Diagnosing thyroid cancer In most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition. Risk factors for thyroid cancer include: having a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis acromegaly – a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone having a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition weight and height radiation exposure Read more about the Diagnosing thyroid cancer A type of blood test known as a thyroid function test will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems. If nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used. In most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to radiation. What is cancer? Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body. Lymph nodes produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence system against infection and illness). Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. The most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). They spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. When DTCs are diagnosed, they’re usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes. The rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. By the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. In advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs. Anaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs. Risk factors for thyroid cancer The main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are: having a thyroid condition having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone) having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions weight and height radiation exposure Thyroid conditions Your risk of developing thyroid cancer is slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland (thyroiditis) or an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre). Having an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) doesn’t increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer. Around 1 in 5 cases of thyroid cancer occur in people who’ve had a previous benign thyroid condition. Family history Inherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. If the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body’s processes won’t work normally. This inherited mutation occurs in: familial medullary thyroid cancer multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, types 2A and 2B In cases of MEN2A or MEN2B thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. In familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood. If one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN syndrome, you should consider having a blood test to find out whether you have the mutated genes. If your test results are positive, it’s recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution. Familial adenomatous polyposis If you have a bowel condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. FAP runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene. Macmillan Cancer Support have more information about familial adenomatous polyposis . Acromegaly Thyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly. This is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone. Previous breast conditions If you’ve had a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your risk of developing thyroid cancer increases by around half (50%) compared with women who haven’t had this type of condition. Weight and height If you’re overweight, you’re more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn’t overweight. Research has also shown that taller adults have an increased risk. However, the reasons for this are unclear. Radiation exposure Exposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer. ",,"Complications of thyroid cancer About thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck. The most common symptom of cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck. Read more about how thyroid cancer is diagnosed . Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of radiotherapy that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning. Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland. Read more about Recurrence Cancerous cells will return in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones. You’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly. Read more about the complications of thyroid cancer Preventing thyroid cancer From the available evidence, eating a healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer. A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains. Many recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960. Other risk factors Diet If your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you’re at an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. People exposed to radiation, or those with a history of benign thyroid conditions, are more likely to have low levels of iodine. Eating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. To help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet. People with a high body mass index (BMI) also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. Gender Women are about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It’s thought this may be because of the hormones released during a woman’s monthly period or during pregnancy. However, there’s little scientific evidence to support this theory. Diagnosing thyroid cancer For many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a GP. repeat FNAC combined with an ultrasound scan other types of scan, such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan In most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling when it hasn’t been possible to rule out thyroid cancer. All NHS hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) that treat thyroid cancer. An MDT is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include: a surgeon a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue) a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your first point of contact with the rest of the team the type of thyroid cancer you have the grade of your cancer whether your care team thinks a complete cure is realistically achievable Most differentiated thyroid cancers – papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas – and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure. Differentiated thyroid cancers are treated using a combination of: surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes. Thyroidectomy In almost all cases of thyroid cancer it’s necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland (total thyroidectomy). This decision will be influenced by: the type of thyroid cancer you have the size of the tumour whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland Your surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so you can make an informed decision. A thyroidectomy is carried out under a general anaesthetic and usually takes around 2 hours. The operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which shouldn’t be very noticeable. In a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness. Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 5 days after having thyroid surgery. However, you’ll need to rest at home for 2 to 3 weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting. A member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you’ll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work. Replacement hormone therapy If some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system. This means you’ll experience You’ll need to have regular blood tests to check you’re receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted. Your MDT will be able to advise you about whether or not rhTSH is suitable for you. The procedure dry mouth You’ll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided. Dietary recommendations avoid all seafood limit the amount of dairy products you eat don’t take cough medicines or use sea salt as they both contain iodine You should eat plenty of fresh meat, fresh fruit and vegetables , and pasta and rice. These are all low in iodine. Pregnancy and breastfeeding You should also not resume breastfeeding your baby. However, it’s safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future. You should use a reliable method of contraception Fertility External radiotherapy External radiotherapy , where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. The length of time you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression. Side effects of radiotherapy include: nausea vomiting tiredness pain when swallowing dry mouth These side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body. they think it’s likely to be effective there are no better alternatives If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they’ll tell you that it’s unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. Complications of thyroid cancer It’s estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck. An estimated 10% to 15% of people will see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones. Because of the risk of cancer cells returning, you’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly. Thyroglobulin testing Thyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that’s used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells. Thyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells. If you’ve had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned. Regularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned. For the first few years after having surgery you’ll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. After this period, you’ll need to be tested once a year. Ultrasound scan An ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. An ultrasound scan can detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer. Radioactive iodine scan After surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test. You swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. The radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body. Before the scan, you’ll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication. As only a small dose of radioactive iodine is used, it’s not necessary to keep your distance from others. However, if you think you may be pregnant or you’re breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test. A radioactive iodine scan will usually be carried out 6 to 8 months after surgery. ",
Tinnitus,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/tinnitus/,Tinnitus is the name for hearing sounds that come from inside your body rather than an outside source. It’s not usually a sign of anything serious and may get better by itself. ,"Tinnitus is often called ‘ringing in the ears’ but it’s not just ringing. You might hear: buzzing humming grinding hissing whistling music or singing noises that beat in time with your pulse You may also notice hearing loss or that you’re more sensitive to everyday sounds. For some people, tinnitus may come and go. But sometimes it can impact your daily life and be very distressing. It can affect concentration and cause difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression . Tinnitus will sometimes get better over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it. When to get medical advice Speak to your GP practice if: you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears your tinnitus is getting worse your tinnitus is bothering you – for example, it’s affecting your sleep or concentration, or is making you feel anxious and depressed you have tinnitus that beats in time with your pulse Diagnosing tinnitus Your doctor can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up . They can also check if you have any hearing loss . Do try to relax – deep breathing or yoga may help try to find ways to improve your sleep, such as sticking to a bedtime routine or cutting down on caffeine try to avoid things that can make tinnitus worse, such as stress or loud background noises join a support group – talking to other people with tinnitus may help you cope Don’t do not have total silence – listening to soft music or sounds (sound therapy) may distract you from the tinnitus do not focus on it, as this can make it worse – hobbies and activities may take your mind off it ","Tinnitus can develop slowly over time or happen suddenly. It’s not known exactly why it happens but it’s often linked to: hearing loss inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises or some medicines an earwax build-up a middle ear infection Ménière’s disease vertigo (a spinning sensation) Who is affected? Most people have tinnitus for a short time after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert. Around 1 in 10 people have persistent tinnitus. Around 1 in 100 having severe tinnitus that affects their daily life. Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children. It’s more common in people aged over 65. How is tinnitus treated ",,sound therapy – listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus counselling – to teach you about tinnitus and help you learn to cope with it better cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) – to help you start to tune tinnitus out and become less aware of it ,
Transient ischaemic attack (TIA),https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/transient-ischaemic-attack-tia/,"A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or mini stroke, happens when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. ","stroke . However, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours. Phone 999 immediately if: you suspect you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke Do not drive if you suspect you have had a stroke or TIA (transient ischaemic attack). FAST stands for: Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake diabetes or high blood pressure . complete paralysis of one side of the body sudden loss or blurring of vision dizziness confusion difficulty understanding what others are saying problems with balance and co-ordination A TIA is a warning that you’re at risk of having a full stroke. An assessment can help doctors decide the best way to reduce the chances of this happening. Referral to a specialist If a TIA is suspected, you’ll see a specialist for further tests as soon as possible. You’ll normally take aspirin while you’re waiting for specialist assessment. This can help to reduce your risk of having a stroke or another TIA in the meantime. It’s likely you’ll see a doctor who specialises in strokes. Tests Blood tests You might need blood tests to determine whether you have high cholesterol , and to check if you have diabetes . Electrocardiogram (ECG) An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures your heart’s electrical activity using electrodes (small, sticky patches) on your skin. An ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions like atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly) . Carotid ultrasound A carotid ultrasound scan can show if there’s narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain. A small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they create an image of the inside of your body. Brain scans Brain scans are not always necessary if you’ve had a TIA. You might have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . This scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain. You might have a computerised tomography (CT) scan if an MRI scan is not suitable for you. This type of scan uses a series of X-rays to produce an image of the inside of brain. stroke . ","TIAs happen when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain. In TIAs, the blockage resolves before any significant damage. A full stroke disrupts the blood flow to your brain for much longer. This leads to more severe damage to the brain and longer-term problems. The blockage responsible for most TIAs is usually caused by a blood clot that has travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain. A type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation can also cause TIAs. It can create blood clots that escape from the heart and become stuck in the blood vessels that supply the brain. There are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or TIA: poor diet lack of exercise obesity smoking an excessive alcohol intake high cholesterol high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes atrial fibrillation Lifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication. Taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation will help reduce the risk of stroke. If you’ve had a stroke or TIA, these measures are particularly important because you’re more likely to have another stroke in future. There are some risk factors you can’t change like: age – people over 65 are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age – including in children family history – if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher ethnicity – if you’re south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups your medical history – if you’ve had a stroke , transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or heart attack , your risk of stroke is higher Diagnosing TIAs You should have an assessment in hospital as soon as possible if you think you’ve had a TIA. Initial assessment ",,"Lifestyle changes There are lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your chances of having a stroke after a TIA like: eating a healthy diet – a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains exercising regularly – this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level stopping smoking if you smoke cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink Medication Most people who’ve had a TIA will take medication to reduce their chances of having a stroke or another TIA. antiplatelets like aspirin and clopidogrel anticoagulants like apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or warfarin medication to lower your blood pressure (antihypertensives) statins to lower your cholesterol The antiplatelet medications need to be taken immediately. Others may only be started later and usually need to be taken long term. Carotid endarterectomy A carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove part of the lining of the carotid artery and any blockage in the artery. By unblocking the carotid arteries, a carotid endarterectomy can reduce the risk of having a stroke or another TIA. ",
Trigeminal neuralgia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/trigeminal-neuralgia/,About trigeminal neuralgia ,"When to seek medical advice You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes. The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees. Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye. You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly. After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks. You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission. Symptom triggers Attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as: talking smiling chewing brushing your teeth washing your face a light touch shaving or putting on make-up swallowing kissing a cool breeze or air conditioning head movements vibrations, such as walking or a car journey However, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever. Further problems Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected. You may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse. The emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression . During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide . Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.

","Diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia In the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. This compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. In rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour. Read more about the Who is affected It’s not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare. Some studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. The condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60. How trigeminal neuralgia is treated There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years. Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as hearing loss , facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke . Read more about Although the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve. The trigeminal nerve The trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. You have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. Small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. These are: the upper branch (ophthalmic) – which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head the middle branch (maxillary) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums the lower branch (mandibular) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums These branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the Gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa. Trigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected. Pressure on the trigeminal nerve Evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the Gasserian ganglion. In most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it’s not known why this happens. It’s also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. It may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve. Other reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include: a tumour (a growth or lump) a cyst (fluid-filled sac) arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins) multiple sclerosis (MS) – a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) Diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia As the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their GP. Ruling out other conditions An important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain. For example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, and multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. However, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of MS. MRI scans sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by MS. An MRI can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main . However, highly sophisticated MRI scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia. Avoid triggers tiredness and sleepiness dizziness (lightheadedness) difficulty concentrating and memory problems confusion feeling unsteady on your feet feeling sick and vomiting double vision a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia) allergic skin reactions, such as urticaria (hives) You should speak to your GP if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous. Carbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts of self-harm or suicide . You should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your GP. If this is not possible, call the NHS 24 111 service. Other medications Carbamazepine may stop working over time. If this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures. ",Read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia Seeing your GP ,"About trigeminal neuralgia Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock. It usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly. In the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face, with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time. People with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day. It’s possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks. Typically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever. Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression. Read more about the epilepsy ) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream. Unless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor. Carbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages. Identifying triggers and avoiding them can also help. For example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. A transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather. Hot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. Using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. It is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals. Certain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas. Medication As normal painkillers such as paracetamol epilepsy ) to help control your pain. These medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain. They need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.  Unless otherwise instructed by your GP or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. Taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems. Initially, your GP will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable. Carbamazepine You will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief. In addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including: oxcarbazepine lamotrigine gabapentin pregabalin baclofen However, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, “dummy” medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical. If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you. With most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. Not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. Talk to your GP if you are finding the side effects unbearable. Surgery and procedures There is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won’t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. If one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently. Some of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below. Percutaneous procedures There are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull. These are known can “percutaneous” (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out using X-rays to guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under a general anaesthetic (where you are asleep). Percutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include: glycerol injections – where a medication called glycerol in injected around the Gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together) radiofrequency lesioning – where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the Gasserian ganglion balloon compression – where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the Gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removed Overall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. The pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. Sometimes these procedures do not work at all. The major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. The sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. Very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable. The procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles. Stereotactic radiosurgery Stereotactic radiosurgery does not require a general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek. A metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (a local anaesthetic is used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. The frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest. The most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. This can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome. Microvascular decompression Microvascular decompression (MVD) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. Instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it. This is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon. During MVD, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. They will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue. For many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.  Currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia. However, it’s an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss, stroke and even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases). More information and support Living with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult. You may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK , for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences. Research has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. Learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression. However, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering “cures” for the condition. There is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media. ",

Read more about the and diagnosing TB Latent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened. Read more about the Read about the lack of appetite and weight loss a high temperature (fever) night sweats extreme tiredness or fatigue Pulmonary TB Most infections affect the lungs, which can cause: a persistent cough that lasts more than 3 weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody breathlessness that gradually gets worse This is known as pulmonary TB. Extrapulmonary TB Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the nervous system (brain and nerves). This is known as extrapulmonary TB. persistently swollen glands abdominal (tummy) pain pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint confusion a persistent headache seizures (fits) Extrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV . Up to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened – for example, during chemotherapy . Who’s most at risk? Anyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those: who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB – around 3 in every 4 TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected living in crowded conditions with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as HIV If you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient. Mantoux test The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It’s also called the tuberculin skin test (TST). If you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection. If you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage. If you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB. Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) The IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available. The IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB: if you have a positive Mantoux test if you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases) as part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common as part of a health check when you register with a GP 2 antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 6 months 2 additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first 2 months It may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB. After taking the medicine for 2 weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics. being sick yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice) an unexplained high temperature (fever) tingling or numbness in your hands or feet a rash or itchy skin changes to your vision, such as blurred vision Rifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill . Use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms , while taking rifampicin. Preventing the spread of infection ","Diagnosing tuberculosis TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it usually only spreads after prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. For example, it often spreads within a family who live in the same house. Who is affected? Before antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common. However, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common. It’s estimated that around one-third of the world’s population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point. How TB is treated for more information about latent and active TB. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain TB bacteria. Although it is spread in a similar way to a cold or the flu , TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself. For example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train. Not everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection. Latent or active TB ","This will include a chest X-ray to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria. a computerised tomography (CT) scan , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , or ultrasound scan of the affected part of the body examining the inside of your body with a long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy) urine and blood tests a biopsy – a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria You may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Screening for latent TB ","About tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. TB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system. If you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest X-ray , blood tests , and a skin test called the Mantoux test. Read more about Tuberculosis vaccination The BCG vaccine can provide effective protection against TB in up to 8 out of 10 people who are given it. Currently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB. This includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and people under the age of 16 who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB for more than three months. It’s also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated because of the increased risk of contracting TB while working. corticosteroids , chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of arthritis and certain gut conditions) who are very young or very old – the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse, alcohol misuse , or homelessness Diagnosing tuberculosis Several tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected. Pulmonary TB Extrapulmonary TB if you are a healthcare worker antibiotics lasting several months. Pulmonary TB Extrapulmonary TB Extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months. If you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a corticosteroid such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas. As with pulmonary TB, it’s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course. Latent TB Latent TB is also not always treated if it’s thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active. chemotherapy or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active. Isoniazid can cause nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy You will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it’s important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should: always cover your mouth – preferably with a disposable tissue – when coughing, sneezing or laughing carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time do not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it ",
Toothache,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mouth/toothache/,"If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always phone the dental practice that you normally attend . If you are not registered with any dental practice then your nearest dental practice will still be able to help. Toothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that’s usually caused by tooth decay. You may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold. The pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel sharp and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you’re lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain. It can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it’s coming from the ear. Toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it’s coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. The area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch. It’s also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a dull pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth. When to see your dentist If you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get. If your toothache isn’t treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a dental abscess , with severe and continuous throbbing pain. Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen , may reduce the pain and discomfort while you’re waiting for an appointment. Children under 16 years of age shouldn’t be given aspirin. Find a dentist near you ",,"Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels. Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of: tooth decay – this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth a cracked tooth – the crack is often so small that it can’t be seen with the naked eye loose or broken fillings receding gums – where the gums shrink (contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root periapical abscess – a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn’t affected. These include: periodontal abscess – a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection ulcers on your gums sore or swollen gums around a tooth that’s breaking through – for example, when your wisdom teeth start to come through sinusitis an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint) Babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething. ",,"X-ray to try to identify the problem. If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling. If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place. Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can’t be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted). Preventing toothache The best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks – you should have these as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride – gently brush your gums and tongue as well clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash stop smoking – smoking can make some dental problems worse Make sure you have regular dental check-ups , preferably with the same dentist. The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems. Your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health. Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early. Read more about taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean . ",
Transverse myelitis,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/transverse-myelitis/,Transverse myelitis is a rare neurological condition. It’s caused by inflammation (swelling) of the spinal cord. The swelling damages the nerves and can leave permanent scars or lesions. The scars or lesions interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body. ‘Transverse’ refers to the swelling being across the width of the spinal cord. It’s also sometimes used to describe swelling that only affects part of the width of the spinal cord. ,"muscle weakness in the legs, and sometimes the arms mobility problems unusual sensations and numbness bladder problems bowel problems sexual problems pain Muscle weakness Physiotherapy can help improve strength, and the muscle spasms and stiffness that may sometimes develop. Techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted. If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine. These medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your healthcare professional. Mobility problems Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance can also cause mobility problems. If you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest: an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings An occupational therapist can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations. ","Autoimmune disease MS-like swelling neuromyelitis optica (NMO) myelin oligodendrocyte antibody (MOG) associated myelitis sarcoidosis Sjögrens syndrome lupus Viral infection Sometimes transverse myelitis is caused indirectly by a viral infection, although often the virus responsible isn’t identified. Transverse myelitis often develops after a viral infection like: echovirus enterovirus Epstien-Barr hepatitis A herpes simplex HIV rubella influenza (flu) Bacterial infection Bacterial infections such as syphilis might also lead to transverse myelitis. Cancer Some cancers might trigger an unusual immune response that can lead to transverse myelitis. Diagnosing transverse myelitis If your GP thinks you could have transverse myelitis, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment. Some of the tests you may need to confirm transverse myelitis are: neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan lumbar puncture blood test s Sometimes your neurologist will do other tests to look for conditions that cause transverse myelitis. This might include CT scans . ",,"steroid side effects . The side effects could include reflux and stomach irritation, worsening infection, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping. Bladder problems Medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night. If you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder. Sometimes a catheter can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC). In rare cases, people with transverse myelitis may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely. . Bowel problems It might be possible to treat mild to moderate constipation by changing your diet or taking laxatives . More severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools. Anti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence. Sexual problems If you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help. If you have transverse myelitis and find it hard to get or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) you may be prescribed medication to increase the blood flow to the penis. Musculoskeletal pain A physiotherapist might be able to help with this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions. If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves. Neuropathic pain Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation. This type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers. ",

This means the small intestine must be used to pass waste products out of your body instead. During the surgery, your small intestine will either be: joined to the surface of your tummy (known as an ileostomy or a colostomy) – after this type of surgery, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear joined directly to your rectum (the end of your large bowel), so your poo comes out of your bottom as usual used to create an internal pouch that’s connected to your bottom (known as an ileo-anal pouch or J-pouch) – this means your poo can pass through your bottom as usual Diet You could: eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains drink plenty of water You could also speak to your IBD team about: removing trigger foods from your diet – but do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet being referred to a dietitian Managing stress To help manage stress, you could: exercise – speak to your IBD team about a suitable exercise plan try relaxation techniques like yoga, medication and breathing exercises talk to others – Crohn’s & Colitis UK has details of local support groups speak to your GP if you think you may have depression Fertility and pregnancy A woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by ulcerative colitis. However, surgery for ulcerative colitis might affect your fertility, especially pouch surgery. Most women with ulcerative colitis will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Type 1 diabetes,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/diabetes/type-1-diabetes/,About type 1 diabetes ,"Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all. If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body’s organs. When blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated. feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired all the time weight loss and loss of muscle bulk persistent infections such as thrush Read more about the There is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. Your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly. Read more about the complications of type 1 diabetes Living with diabetes feeling very thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection) blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape feeling shaky and irritable sweating tingling lips feeling weak feeling confused hunger nausea (feeling sick) A hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary. If it isn’t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness. extreme thirst a dry mouth blurred vision drowsiness a need to pass urine frequently Left untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death. ‘Sick Day’ rules . The Diabetes UK website has more information about . Urine and blood tests Your urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn’t usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes. If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you’ll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. Your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it. Once you begin to come round, you’ll need to eat something sugary when you’re alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there’s a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. You’ll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body. If the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn’t work, and you’re still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you’ll need urgent medical attention. You’ll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional. If you have type 1 diabetes, it’s recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic. If significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) . Islet cell transplantation Some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes. In 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below). You may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you’ve had: two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia Your healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you’re unwell. Heart disease and stroke If you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke . Prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis (furring and narrowing of your blood vessels). This may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke. Nerve damage High blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation . Retinopathy Retinopathy is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. If it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision. The better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. Having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated. you have any other concerns Pregnancy If you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team. A planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant. Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby. You’ll need to keep your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects. You should also take a higher dose of folic acid tablets. Folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. Doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. Women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they’re 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription). Folic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin D . Insulin and metformin are safe to take during pregnancy. It’s important to review any other medications you take to ensure these are safe to take during pregnancy. You should also have your eyes checked. Retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. Pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant. Your GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice. Diabetes UK and JDRF also provide more useful information about pregnancy and diabetes to help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start. Education You’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves. This gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. It also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels). Structured patient education Structured patient education means there’s a planned course that: covers all aspects of diabetes is flexible in content is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background There are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide. Diabetes and your child For a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher. To prevent hypos whilst driving you should check your blood glucose levels before driving keep medication close by in the car take regular breaks on long journeys over 2 hours avoid missing meals For more information about driving with diabetes, visit Diabetes UK . ","Diagnosing type 1 diabetes The hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin Type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin This topic is about type 1 diabetes. Read more about type 2 diabetes Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth. It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them. Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated . This results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes. Read more about the Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that’s needed to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. When you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients – including glucose – into your bloodstream. The pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it’s converted to energy. However, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can’t be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells. Autoimmune condition Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin. It’s not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection. Type 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic. If you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don’t have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%. Read about diagnosing type 1 diabetes Diagnosing type 1 diabetes If you experience the ","Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control. In people who’ve already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled. The HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you’re taking to control your diabetes are working. If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it’s recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if: you’ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes your blood glucose remains too high The Diabetes UK website has information and advice about your child and diabetes . Help and support Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who’ve been diagnosed with the condition. The Diabetes UK website enables you to find your local diabetes support group . If you want to contact a trained counsellor directly, you can phone Diabetes UK’s care line on 0345 123 2399, or email helpline.scotland@diabetes.org.uk Further information on Helpline Scotland Financial support and benefits Some people with diabetes may be eligible to receive disability benefits and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their life. The main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, elderly people, people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, and those with complications of diabetes . People over 65 who are severely disabled, may qualify for a type of disability benefit called Attendance Allowance. Carers may also be entitled to some benefit too, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes. Staff at your local Citizen’s Advice Scotland can check whether you’re getting all of the benefits you’re entitled to. Both they and your diabetes specialist nurse should also be able to give you advice about filling in the forms. Driving with diabetes It’s a common myth that people with diabetes aren’t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think. You should always tell your insurer that you are diabetic as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years. Additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the DVLA guidelines . ","Complications of type 1 diabetes Living with type 1 diabetes About type 1 diabetes As your body can’t produce insulin, you’ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You’ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do. Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You’ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations. Insulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid) acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that’s inserted under the skin with a needle. There are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they’re only suitable for a small number of patients. They are: islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes a complete pancreas transplant – this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this. Read more about diagnosing diabetes and Complications If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. For example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease . Your healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through My Diabetes My Way . It’s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. Read more about living with type 1 diabetes When to seek urgent medical attention You should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop: a loss of appetite nausea or vomiting a high temperature stomach pain fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves) Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) If you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”). In most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) As diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy. you’re planning a pregnancy Unlike other tests, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn’t require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it’s less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy. The advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes. Read about Monitoring blood glucose healthy, balanced diet , but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they’re not too high or too low. Exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels. The normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it’s a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood. There is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. This is called a flash glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre). The Diabetes UK website has more information on testing your glucose levels . Having your blood glucose levels checked You’ll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels. Your GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test. The ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol. Hypoglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It’s likely that you’ll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time. Mild hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as: 200ml pure fruit juice 5 to 7 Dextrose tablets 4 to 5 Glucotabs 60ml Glucojuice 5 jelly babies You may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you: weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb) have poor kidney function need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person An islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that’s carried out under local anaesthetic. The procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards. Pancreas transplant People with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time. Others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they’ve had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets. If you’re having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended. During the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you to get a new source of insulin. Pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there’s a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list. The waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there’s a shortage of suitable donor organs. Hyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin. If you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this. If hyperglycaemia isn’t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood. Diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death. The signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include: frequently passing urine thirst tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy) blurry vision abdominal (stomach) pain nausea and vomiting deep breathing smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops) collapse and unconsciousness Read more about the Type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing heart disease , stroke , eye and kidney disease . To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take: anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure a statin – such as simvastatin – to reduce high cholesterol levels low-dose aspirin to prevent stroke angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It’s often reversible if treated early enough. Care standards for diabetes In Scotland there is a National Diabetes Improvement Plan produced by the Scottish Diabetes Group, patients and health care professionals. The Diabetes National Service Framework has also been developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes: access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle – including a named contact for their care information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications access to services to identify and treat possible complications – such as screening for diabetic retinopathy (where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason Complications of type 1 diabetes If diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. If the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended. injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes Read about diabetic eye screening Kidney disease If the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently. In rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure and the need for dialysis Foot problems Damage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection. If you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have a foot examination at least once a year. Sexual dysfunction In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication. Women with diabetes may experience: a reduced sex drive (loss of libido) reduced pleasure from sex vaginal dryness a reduced ability to orgasm pain during sex If you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel. Miscarriage and stillbirth Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. If your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect. Pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. This allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood glucose levels and control their insulin dosage more easily. Read more about diabetes and pregnancy: Diabetes UK My Diabetes My Way Living with type 1 diabetes Look after your feet Having diabetes means that you’re more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet. To prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early. Regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days. The Diabetes UK website has more information and advice about taking care of your feet . Regular eye tests If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy. Retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). If it isn’t treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss. Read more about diabetic eye screening Diabetes sick day rules If you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”. Contact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven’t received these. The advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to: keep taking your insulin – it’s very important not test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high Seek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if: ",

If your GP practice is closed, phone 111. Your GP may recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin. ","The skin will normally start to flake and peel after a few days and will usually fully heal within 7 days. While sunburn is often short-lived and mild, it’s important to try to avoid it, because it can increase your chances of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life. It’s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn’t usually develop for several hours. Breezes and getting wet (such as going in and out of the sea) may cool your skin, so you don’t realise you’re getting burnt. You should always be aware of the risk of sunburn if you’re outside in strong sun, and look out for your skin getting hot. What to do if you’re sunburnt If you or your child has sunburn, you should get out of the sun as soon as possible – head indoors or into a shady area. You can usually treat mild sunburn at home, although there are some circumstances where you should seek medical advice. ",,"Find your nearest pharmacy When to seek medical advice Contact your GP practice if: Who’s at risk of sunburn? Everyone who is exposed to UV light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others. You should take extra care when out in the sun if you: have pale, white or light brown skin have freckles or red or fair hair tend to burn rather than tan have many moles have skin problems relating to a medical condition are only exposed to intense sun occasionally – for example, while on holiday are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense have a family history of skin cancer People who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it’s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don’t take the right precautions. Snow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun’s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes. Dangers of UV rays The short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sun allergy . The longer-term risks (over decades) include: actinic (solar) keratoses – rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin skin cancer – including both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer eye problems – such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and cataracts premature ageing of the skin and wrinkling Preventing sunburn Skin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen. In the UK, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from March to October, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun’s rays are strongest. There is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions. For example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions. Suitable clothing Suitable clothing includes: a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears a long-sleeved top trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the CE Mark and European Standard EN 1836:2005. Sunscreen When buying sunscreen, make sure it’s suitable for your skin and blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. The sunscreen label should have: the letters ‘UVA’ in a circle logo and at least 4-star UVA protection at least SPF30 sunscreen to protect against UVB Most people do not apply enough sunscreen. The amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (SPF) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion. If sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. If you’re worried you might not be applying enough SPF30, you could use a stronger SPF50 sunscreen. If you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice: 30 minutes before going out just before you go out Sunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better. How long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. The Cancer Research UK website has a handy tool where you can find out your skin type , to see when you might be at risk of burning. Water-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely. Sunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This includes straight after you’ve been in water (even if it is ‘water-resistant’) and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off. Advice for babies and children Children aged under 6 months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight. From March to October in the UK, children should: cover up with suitable clothing spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm) wear at least SPF30 sunscreen To ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under 5 are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun.

Read more about type 1 diabetes Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. Due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. It’s far more common than type 1 diabetes. Read about the Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance). The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. Insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s converted into energy. In type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes Four of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are: age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south Asian people) genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister weight – being overweight or obese ethnicity – being of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK Age Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older. Maintaining a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly are ways of preventing and managing diabetes. White people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African descent have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age. However, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition. It’s also becoming more common for children – as young as seven in some cases – to develop type 2 diabetes, mainly due to rising obesity levels. Genetics Genetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition. The closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition. Being overweight or obese You’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you’re overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. Fat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body’s cardiovascular and metabolic systems. This increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including coronary heart disease , stroke and some types of cancer. Measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal obesity , which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity. Women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more. Asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more. Exercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%. Read about measuring your waist size Ethnicity People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in south Asian communities than in the general UK population, and it’s three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin. People of south Asian and African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developing complications of type 2 diabetes , such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population. Other risks Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. This is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. Discuss your options with your GP. Pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don’t take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include eating healthily , losing weight if you’re overweight, and taking plenty of regular exercise . Women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life. ","Hyperglycaemia Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can’t produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don’t respond properly to the insulin that is produced. This means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia. Hyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including: eating too much being unwell ineffective diabetes medication not taking enough medication ","Complications of type 2 diabetes Living with type 2 diabetes About type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease. Read more about the Complications of type 2 diabetes Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It’s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents. Read more about the complications of type 2 diabetes Preventing type 2 diabetes If you’re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes. These include: losing weight if you’re overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight eating a healthy, balanced diet stopping smoking if you smoke drinking alcohol in moderation taking plenty of regular exercise Living with type 2 diabetes Medicines for type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and usually gets worse over time. Making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term. You may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels. Initially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. It may also include insulin or another medication that you inject. Metformin Metformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. It also makes your body’s cells more responsive to insulin. If you’re overweight, it’s also likely you’ll be prescribed metformin. Unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn’t cause additional weight gain. However, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea , and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage. SGLT2 inhibitors SGLT2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. They’re particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease. The three SGLT2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include: dapagliflozin canagliflozin empagliflozin Each medication is taken as a tablet once a day. The main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections. If you’re unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it’s important you stop these medications. Get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing. GLP-1 agonists GLP-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone GLP-1 (see the section on gliptins, below). They’re given by injection and boost your own insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (“hypos”). They’re also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease. Sulphonylureas Sulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that’s produced by your pancreas. Examples include: glibenclamide gliclazide glimepiride glipizide gliquidone You may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can’t take metformin. Alternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn’t control blood glucose on its own. Sulphonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. They can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (TZD), which make your body’s cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood. It’s usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. It may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema). You shouldn’t take pioglitazone if you have heart failure or a high risk of bone fracture. Gliptins (DPP-4 inhibitors) Gliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1. GLP-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down. By preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don’t result in episodes of hypoglycaemia. You may be prescribed a gliptin if you’re unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. They’re not associated with weight gain and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese. This can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it. Insulin injections Insulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet. If you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it. They will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly. Insulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). Most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day. Your GP practice or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly. You can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the Diabetes UK website. If you have type 2 diabetes that’s controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes of hypoglycaemia . Hypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low. Mild hypoglycaemia (a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary. If you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets. This should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit. In most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. You should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes. If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. You may require input from a health care professional. If the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein. Your diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one. If you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing heart disease , stroke , foot problems, eye and kidney disease is increased. To reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including: anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure a statin , such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce high cholesterol low-dose aspirin to prevent a stroke an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. If treated early enough, it may be reversible. Monitoring blood glucose levels If you have type 2 diabetes, your GP or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months. The HbA1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months. HbA1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it. Your diabetes care team can help you set a target HbA1c level to aim for. This will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team. Read more about the HbA1c test Monitoring your own blood glucose If you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home. Even if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels. Other factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. A blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. It can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). If blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low. Blood glucose meters aren’t currently available for free on the NHS but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. Ask a member of your diabetes care team if you’re unsure. Regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible. In home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood. A millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. The measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short. A normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person. Your diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. It’s important to know your individual targets. Complications of type 2 diabetes If diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. The better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. If the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended. injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes Read about diabetic eye screening. Kidney disease If the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently. In rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead to kidney failure dialysis or sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary. Foot problems Damage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection. If you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have your feet examined at least once a year. If poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Sexual dysfunction In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication. Women with diabetes may experience: reduced sex drive (loss of libido) less pleasure from sex vaginal dryness less ability to orgasm pain during sex If you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel. Miscarriage and stillbirth Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. If your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect. Pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician). This will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby. The Diabetes UK website has more information about diabetes complications . Looking after your eyes The NHS diabetic eye screening programme will arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year. Everyone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. Speak to your GP to register. Living with type 2 diabetes Look after your feet If you have diabetes, you’re at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves. To prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early. Regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days. Regular eye tests If you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). Left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss. Read more about diabetic eye screening People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can’t be relied upon for other conditions. Pregnancy If you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team. If you’re taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. It’s important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team. Planning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant. You’ll need to tightly control your blood glucose level – particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby’s development – to reduce the risk of birth defects. You should also: check your medications – some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications take a higher dose of folic acid tablets – folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it’s recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin D have your eyes checked – retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant Your GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice. Diabetes education You’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed and on an ongoing basis. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves. Structured patient education Structured patient education means there’s a planned course that: covers all aspects of diabetes is flexible in content is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background For type 2 diabetes, there are several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide. Talk to others Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the condition. To find your local diabetes support group , visit Diabetes UK . If you want to get in touch with a trained counsellor directly, you can call the Diabetes UK Helpline on 0345 123 2399 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm) or email helpline@diabetes.org.uk Financial support and benefits Some people with diabetes may be eligible for disability and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their lives. The main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, the elderly, and those with learning disabilities, mental health difficulties or diabetes complications. People over the age of 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a type of disability benefit called Attendance Allowance. Carers may also be entitled to some benefits, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes. Citizens Advice Scotland can check whether you’re getting all the benefits you’re entitled to. Your diabetes specialist nurse and Citizens Advice can also provide advice about filling in the forms. Driving with diabetes It’s a common myth that people with diabetes aren’t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think. You should always tell your insurer that you have diabetes as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years. Additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the DVLA guidelines . Unfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos. If you start to have a hypo whilst driving you should: Pull over safely Switch off your car engine Take fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers Don’t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or above For more information about driving with diabetes, visit Diabetes UK. Diabetes sick day rules If you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”. Contact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven’t received these. The advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to: test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high Seek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if: ",

Around 1 in 3,500 to 4,000 babies are born with an underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism using a blood spot test when the baby is about 5 days old. tiredness being sensitive to cold weight gain constipation depression slow movements and thoughts muscle aches and weakness muscle cramps dry and scaly skin brittle hair and nails loss of libido (sex drive) pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) irregular periods or heavy periods Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.

Thyroid function test A blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether there’s a problem. The test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood. A high level of TSH and a low level of T4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid. If your test results show raised TSH but normal T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future. Your GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid. Blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called triiodothyronine (T3). However, this isn’t routine, because T3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid. The Lab Tests Online UK website has more information about the different types of thyroid function tests . Referral Your GP may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you: are younger than 16 are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have just given birth have another health condition, such as heart disease , which may complicate your medication are taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithium Once you’re taking the correct dose, you’ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels. Taking levothyroxine If you’re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take 1 tablet at the same time every day. It’s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night. The effectiveness of the tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don’t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless advised otherwise by your doctor. An underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you’ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life. Side effects Levothyroxine doesn’t usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone. Side effects usually only occur if you’re taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including sweating, chest pain , headaches , diarrhoea and vomiting. Combination therapy In the UK, combination therapy – using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together – isn’t routinely used because there’s insufficient evidence to show it’s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy). In most cases, suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate), strokes , osteoporosis and fracture. hypothermia and drowsiness. ","Diagnosing an underactive thyroid When to see your GP An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4). type 1 diabetes and vitiligo. Worldwide, a lack of dietary iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is uncommon in the UK. Babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn’t develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It’s usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth. A problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid. An underactive thyroid has also been linked to some viral infections or some medications used to treat other conditions, such as: lithium – a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including depression and bipolar disorder amiodarone – a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) interferons – a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of cancer and hepatitis C Speak to your GP or specialist if you’re concerned that a medication you’re taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels. Diagnosing an underactive thyroid It’s very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible. Low levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), can change the way the body processes fat. This can cause high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) , which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as angina and heart attack . Therefore, you should see your GP and ask for a blood test if you repeatedly have Pregnancy complications If an underactive thyroid isn’t treated during pregnancy, there’s a risk of problems occurring. These include: pre-eclampsia – which can cause high blood pressure and fluid retention in the mother and growth problems in the baby anaemia in the mother an underactive thyroid in the baby birth defects bleeding after birth problems with the baby’s physical and mental development premature birth or a low birthweight stillbirth or miscarriage ",,"Complications of an underactive thyroid About underactive thyroids An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed. An underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making. thyroid cancer .

Read more about and the complications of an underactive thyroid thyroid cancer or an overactive thyroid . Immune system An underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it’s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine, leading to the An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine. Levothyroxine replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn’t make enough of. You’ll initially have regular blood tests until the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached. This can take a little while to get right. thyroid cancer and there’s a significant risk of it reoccurring. Complications of an underactive thyroid Several complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn’t treated. Heart problems If you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developing cardiovascular disease is increased. This is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. High cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting the flow of blood. Contact your doctor if you’re being treated for an underactive thyroid and you develop chest pain , so that any problems can be detected and treated, if necessary. Goitre Myxoedema coma antibiotics and steroid medication ( corticosteroids ) are also required. ",

Read more about diagnosing vaginal cancer. They may also refer you for blood tests If your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2 weeks. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina. Seeing a gynaecologist If you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have: external and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings a colposcopy – an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detail If your gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. This is known as a biopsy . If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread. These tests may include a more detailed internal vaginal examination carried out under general anaesthetic , X-rays , computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans . Staging Healthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced. stage 1 – the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina stage 2 – the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues stage 3 – the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes stage 4a – the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum) stage 4b – the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungs how vaginal cancer is treated . Read further information: Cancer Research UK: tests for vaginal cancer Cancer Research UK: stages of vaginal cancer How it’s carried out There are 2 main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given: external radiotherapy – a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis internal radiotherapy – a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vagina The type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. For example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. You can receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy. Like radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include: tiredness feeling sick increased risk of infections diarrhoea hair loss Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy .

The HPV vaccination , which is routinely offered to girls who are 12 to 13 years old, provides protection against 2 strains of HPV thought to be responsible for most cases of vaginal and cervical cancer. Read more about the . How vaginal cancer is treated Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. The exact reason why this happens in cases of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition. Human papilloma virus (HPV) Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex. There are many different types of HPV and up to 8 out of every 10 people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to vaginal cancer. However, HPV is present in more than two-thirds of people with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer . It’s thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina. Abnormal cells in the cervix or vagina You’re more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you’ve previously been found to have abnormal cells in your: cervix – known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) vagina – known as vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) CIN and VAIN are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. Both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent HPV infection. The abnormal cells don’t usually cause any problems themselves and may only be detected during cervical screening , but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous. If you’re found to have CIN or VAIN, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended. Diethylstilbestrol A medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. The medication was widely prescribed during pregnancy between 1938 and 1971, because it was thought it could help reduce the risk of miscarriage . However, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine. The use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnant was then banned. The risk of vaginal cancer associated with diethylstilbestrol is small and as it’s now over 40 years since it was last used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare. Other possible factors Other things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include: your age – 7 out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women and anyone with a vagina over 60 having a history of reproductive cancers, such as cervical cancer or vulval cancer – particularly if you were treated with radiotherapy smoking having HIV Read further information: Diagnosing vaginal cancer ",,"About vaginal cancer Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the vagina. Cancer that begins in the vagina is called primary vaginal cancer. Cancer that begins in another part of the body – such as the cervix, womb or ovaries – and spreads to the vagina is known as secondary vaginal cancer. This topic is about primary vaginal cancer. There are separate topics on cervical cancer , ovarian cancer and womb cancer . radiotherapy – radiation is used to destroy the cancerous cells surgery to remove the cancerous cells chemotherapy – medication is used to kill the cancerous cells; this is often used in combination with radiotherapy Read more about When you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Radiotherapy Radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation) after surgery to prevent the cancer from returning Read more about how radiotherapy is performed . Side effects Following radiotherapy, it’s likely you will have some side effects. These occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones. Possible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include: sore, red skin – similar to sunburn vaginal discharge pain while passing urine diarrhoea tiredness feeling sick narrowing of the vagina (see below) early menopause and infertility (see below) Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy . Effects on sex Radiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable. Menopause and fertility If you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an early menopause (if you have not had the menopause already). Surgery There are 4 main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer: partial vaginectomy – removing the upper section of your vagina radical vaginectomy – removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes radical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy – removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes pelvic exenteration – removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage) Partial vaginectomy A partial vaginectomy can be used to treat stage 1 vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children. Your surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread. Your surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation. Radical vaginectomy A radical vaginectomy may be used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. The surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina. A plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body – usually one of your thighs or buttocks. You will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make. Radical hysterectomy A radical hysterectomy is often performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy. During a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes. Pelvic exenteration Pelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer. If you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. One solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. A bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. The bag is known as a urostomy bag. Similarly, as you may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. Another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag. Read more about colostomies . A vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after a pelvic exenteration. It may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. In this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy. As pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy depression .

They’ll also feel your pulse at your ankles to make sure the arteries in your leg are working properly. Doppler study This involves measuring the blood pressure in the arteries at your ankles and comparing it to the pressure in your arms. If you have peripheral arterial disease, the blood pressure in your ankles will be lower than your arms. Swelling in the legs and ankles Venous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. This can be controlled by compression bandages. Keeping your leg elevated whenever possible, ideally with your toes at the same level as your eyes, will also help ease swelling. You should put a suitcase, sofa cushion or foam wedge under the bottom of your mattress, to help keep your legs raised while you sleep. You should also keep as active as possible and aim to continue with your normal activities. Regular exercise, such as a daily walk, will help reduce leg swelling. However, you should avoid standing or sitting still with your feet down. You should elevate your feet at least every hour. Itchy skin Some people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin. This is often due to varicose eczema , which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient) and occasionally a mild corticosteroid If your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual. You should also elevate your leg most of the time and you’ll be prescribed a 7-day course of antibiotics .

Referral to a specialist In some cases, your GP or nurse may decide to refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist). Cleaning and dressing the ulcer The first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. This provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal. A simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. This usually needs to be changed once a week. Many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse. Compression To improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. These bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart. There are many different types of bandage or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which may be made in 2, 3 or 4 different layers. The application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff. The bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed. When compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it’s usually painful. Ideally, you should have paracetamol or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your GP. The pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days. It’s important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. If you have any problems, it’s usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. If the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help. However, you’ll need to cut the bandage off if: you get severe pain at the front of your ankle you get severe pain on the top of your foot your toes become blue and swollen Once you remove the bandage, make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. In some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages, such as special stockings or other compressive devices. These may not be available in every clinic but could change the way ulcers are treated in future. Your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you. Itchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. If this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies. It’s important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy, because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers. To help your ulcer heal more quickly, follow the advice below: Try to keep active by walking regularly. Sitting and standing still without elevating your legs can make venous leg ulcers and swelling worse Whenever you’re sitting or lying down, keep your affected leg elevated – with your toes level with your eyes Regularly exercise your legs by moving your feet up and down, and rotating them at the ankles. This can help encourage better circulation If you’re overweight, try to reduce your weight with a healthy diet and regular exercise Stop smoking Moderate your alcohol consumption Be careful not to injure your affected leg, and wear comfortable, well-fitting footwear You may also find it helpful to attend a local healthy leg club, such as those provided by the Lindsay Leg Club Foundation , for support and advice. Follow-up You should visit your nurse once a week to have your dressings and compression bandages changed. They’ll also monitor the ulcer to see how well it’s healing. Once your ulcer is healing well, your nurse will see you less often. After the ulcer has healed Once you’ve had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop within months or years. The most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you’re out of bed. Your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. Various accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off. Read more about preventing venous leg ulcers . Preventing venous leg ulcers You can help reduce your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer in several ways, such as wearing a compression stocking, losing weight and taking care of your skin. People most at risk of developing a venous leg ulcer are those who have previously had a leg ulcer. Compression stockings These stockings are specially designed to squeeze your legs, improving your circulation. They’re usually tightest at the ankle and less tight further up your leg – this encourages blood to flow upwards, towards your heart. To be most effective, these stockings should be put on as soon as you get up and only taken off at night. Compression stockings are available in a variety of sizes, colours, styles and pressures. A nurse can help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. There are various accessories you can buy to help get the stockings on and off. Losing weight If you’re obese or overweight, losing weight can help treat and prevent venous leg ulcers. Excess weight leads to high pressure in the veins in your legs, which can damage your skin. Venous ulcers are much more common among people who are overweight. To help you lose weight, regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet are recommended. You should also avoid sitting or standing for long periods. Elevating your legs whenever possible can also help. Read more about: losing weight health and fitness healthy eating varicose veins may help prevent leg swelling or ulcers. This may involve a procedure where a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into the affected veins with high-frequency radio waves or lasers used to seal them. Alternatively, you may need surgery to repair the damage to your leg veins, or to remove the affected veins altogether. Read more about . ",
Warts and verrucas,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/skin-hair-and-nails/warts-and-verrucas/,Warts are small lumps that often develop on the skin of the hands and feet. They vary in appearance and may develop singly or in clusters. Most people will have warts at some point in their life. They tend to affect children and teenagers more than adults. Warts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV). More images of warts Source: dermnetnz.org Source: dermnetnz.org Cause of warts and verrucas Warts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV). There are lots of different strains of HPV and these cause different types of warts. ,,"How warts spread HPV is passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. It can also be passed on indirectly by contact with contaminated objects like: towels shoes areas surrounding swimming pools the floors of communal changing areas You’re more likely to get infected if your skin is wet or damaged. Warts can also be spread to other parts of your own body. You can spread the virus if you: scratch, knock or bite a wart bite your nails or suck your fingers (if they have warts on them) shave your face or legs After you become infected, it can take weeks or even months for a wart or verruca to appear. When to get help Warts and verrucas aren’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. ",,"Find your nearest pharmacy Speak to a GP if you have a: growth on your skin that you’re worried about wart or verruca that keeps coming back wart or verruca that’s very large or painful wart that bleeds wart that changes in how it looks wart on your face or genitals Types of wart There are several different types of warts. These vary in size and shape. Common warts (verruca vulgaris) If you have a common wart, it will: be round or oval-shaped be firm and raised have a rough, irregular surface often develop on the knuckles, fingers and knees vary in size, from less than 1mm to more than 10mm (1cm) in diameter You may develop one common wart or several. Filiform warts (verruca filiformis) Source: dermnetnz.org Filiform warts are long and slender in appearance. They often develop on the neck or face. Mosaic warts Mosaic warts grow in clusters and form a ’tile-like’ pattern. They often develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Periungual warts Source: dermnetnz.org Periungual warts develop under and around the fingernails or toenails. They: have a rough surface can affect the shape of the nail can be painful Plane warts Source: dermnetnz.org It’s possible to have between one and several hundred plane warts, which can develop in clusters. They are usually: a yellowish colour smooth, round and flat-topped 2 to 4mm in diameter common in young children – mainly affecting the hands, face and legs Plane warts can sometimes develop on the lower legs of women. This is because the human papilloma virus (HPV) can be spread through shaving. Verrucas (plantar warts) Verrucas usually develop on the soles of the feet. The affected area of skin will be: white, often with a black dot (blood vessel) in the centre flat rather than raised Verrucas can sometimes be painful if they’re on a weight-bearing part of the foot. The length of time it takes for a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. It can take up to 2 years for the virus to leave your system and for warts to disappear. Warts tend to last longer in older children and adults. painful in an awkward position causing you distress or embarrassment Common ways to treat warts and verrucas include: salicylic acid – available from pharmacies in creams, gels, paints and medicated plasters cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is applied to the wart to freeze and destroy affected skin cells Surgery is not usually recommended for warts. Preventing warts and verrucas There are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting warts, and prevent them spreading to others. Do keep your feet dry change your socks every day take care when shaving – the virus can be spread easily if you cut yourself wear gloves when using shared gym equipment if you have a wart on your hand wear pool slippers or flip flops in communal changing rooms and showers cover the wart or verruca with a waterproof plaster or a verruca sock when swimming or while doing PE at school Don’t do not touch other people’s warts do not share towels, flannels or other personal items with someone who has a wart do not share shoes or socks with someone who has a verruca do not scratch or pick a wart or verruca – it’ll encourage the HPV to spread to other parts of your body ",
Testicular cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/testicular-cancer/,About testicular cancer ,"Diagnosing testicular cancer a dull ache in the scrotum a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum It’s important to be aware of what feels normal for you. Get to know your body and speak to your GP if you notice any changes. Read more about the and diagnosing testicular cancer . The testicles The testicles are the 2 oval-shaped male sex organs that sit inside the scrotum on either side of the penis. The testicles are an important part of the male reproductive system because they produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which plays a major role in male sexual development. Types of testicular cancer The different types of testicular cancer are classified by the type of cells the cancer begins in. The most common type of testicular cancer is ‘germ cell testicular cancer’, which accounts for around 95% of all cases. Germ cells are a type of cell that the body uses to create sperm. There are 2 main subtypes of germ cell testicular cancer. They are: seminomas – which have become more common in the last 20 years and now account for 50 to 55% of testicular cancers non-seminomas – which account for most of the rest and include teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and yolk sac tumours Both types tend to respond well to chemotherapy . Less common types of testicular cancer include: Leydig cell tumours – which account for around 1 to 3% of cases Sertoli cell tumours – which account for around 1% of cases lymphoma – which accounts for around 4% of cases This topic focuses on germ cell testicular cancer. You can contact the cancer support specialists at Macmillan for more information about Leydig cell tumour and Sertoli cell tumours. Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and it’s open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm. Read more about Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma . How common is testicular cancer? Testicular cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer. Testicular cancer is unusual compared to other cancers because it tends to affect younger men and anyone with testicles. Although it’s relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49. For reasons that are unclear, white men and anyone with testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with other ethnic groups. The number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear. The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles. The lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger. Most lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren’t in the testicle and aren’t a sign of cancer. But they should never be ignored. Visit your GP as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum. dull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go feeling of heaviness in your scrotum change in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle difference between one testicle and the other When to speak to your GP Speak to your GP as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. They’ll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous. The most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. Lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. Less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones. a persistent cough coughing or spitting up blood shortness of breath swelling and enlargement of male breasts a lump or swelling in your neck lower back pain Diagnosing testicular cancer Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump or other abnormality in your scrotum that you think may be on one of your testicles. They may hold a small light or torch against your scrotum to see whether light passes through it. Testicular lumps tend to be solid, which means light is unable to pass through them. A collection of fluid in the scrotum will allow light to pass through it. Tests for testicular cancer If you have a non-painful lump, or a change in shape or texture of one of your testicles, and your GP thinks it may be cancerous, you’ll be referred for further testing within 2 weeks. Scrotal ultrasound A scrotal ultrasound s can is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your testicle. It’s one of the main ways of finding out whether or not a lump is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). During a scrotal ultrasound, your specialist will be able to determine the position and size of the abnormality in your testicle. It will also give a clear indication of whether the lump is in the testicle or separate within the scrotum, and whether it’s solid or filled with fluid. A fluid-filled lump or collection around the testis is usually harmless. A more solid lump may be a sign the swelling is cancerous. Blood tests tiredness weight gain loss of libido (sex drive) reduced beard growth reduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) Testosterone replacement therapy is where you’re given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin. If you have injections, you’ll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months. After having testosterone replacement therapy, you’ll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve. ","About testicular cancer Cancer of the testicle is one of the less common cancers. It tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age. The most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in one of the testicles . It can be the size of a pea or it may be much larger. Undescended testicles Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer. About 3 to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don’t descend. In most cases, testicles that don’t descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend at a later stage. If the testicles don’t descend naturally, an operation known as an orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum. It’s important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys whose testicles descend normally. It’s also much easier to observe the testicles when they’re in the scrotum. People with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than those whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after. Family history Having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it. For example, if your father had testicular cancer, you’re around 4 times more likely to develop it than someone with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you’re about 8 times more likely to develop it. A number of genes may be involved in the development of testicular cancer in families where more than 1 person has had the condition. This is an ongoing area of research in which patients and their families may be asked to take part. Previous testicular cancer People who’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle. For this reason, if you’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it’s very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle. If you’ve been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it’s very important that you attend your follow-up appointments. Cancer Research UK has more information about . Outlook Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers. Almost all men and anyone with testicles who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it’s rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later. However, several things that increase your risk of developing the condition. Undescended testicles Undescended testicles is the most significant risk factor. When male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. The testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life. However, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. The medical name for undescended testicles is cryptorchidism. Surgery is usually required to move the testicles down. If you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased. Of surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. However, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater than that of the rest of the population. Previous testicular cancer Men and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle. For this reason, it’s important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer. Age and race Unlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. Men and anyone with testicles aged 30 to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. It’s also more common in Northern and Western Europe compared with other parts of the world. Family history Having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it. If your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop it than a person with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it). The fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer. Mutations in 2 genes (known as the KITLG and SPRY4 genes) may increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer. Endocrine disruptors Examples of endocrine disruptors include: some types of pesticide polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical compounds used as a coolant dibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polish In most countries, including the UK, many endocrine disruptors, such as PCBs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. However, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain. However, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. Indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated. Infertility Men and anyone with testicles who are infertile are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. The reasons for this are not clear. Smoking Research has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer than non-smokers. HIV and AIDS Studies show that men and anyone with testicles with HIV or AIDS have an increased risk of testicular cancer. ","blood tests to detect certain hormones in your blood, known as ‘markers’. Testicular cancer often produces these markers, so if they’re in your blood it may indicate you have the condition. Markers in your blood that will be tested for include: AFP (alpha feta protein) HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) A third blood test is also often carried out as it may indicate how active a cancer is. It’s called LDH (lactate dehydrogenate), but it isn’t a specific marker for testicular cancer. Not all people with testicular cancer produce markers. There may still be a chance you have testicular cancer even if your blood test results come back normal. Histology The only way to definitively confirm testicular cancer is to examine part of the lump under a microscope. These tests and reports are called histology. Unlike many cancers where a small piece of the cancer can be removed (a biopsy ), in most cases the only way to examine a testicular lump is by removing the affected testicle completely. Your specialist will only recommend removing your testicle if they’re relatively certain the lump is cancerous. Losing a testicle won’t affect your sex life or ability to have children. ","In some cases, chemotherapy or, less commonly, radiotherapy may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas). Read more about . If you don’t feel comfortable visiting your GP, you can go to your local sexual health clinic , where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you. Metastatic cancer Physical examination Other tests In almost all cases, you’ll need further tests to check whether testicular cancer has spread. When cancer of the testicle spreads, it most commonly affects the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen or the lungs. Therefore, you may require a chest X-ray to check for signs of a tumour. You’ll also need a scan of your entire body. This is usually a CT scan (computerised X-ray) to check for signs of the cancer spreading. In some cases, a different type of scan, known as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be used. Stages of testicular cancer After all tests have been completed, it’s usually possible to determine the stage of your cancer. There are 2 ways that testicular cancer can be staged. The first is known as the TNM staging system: T – indicates the size of the tumour N – indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis) Testicular cancer is also staged numerically. The 4 main stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle) stage 2 – the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen stage 3 – the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or in the neck stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the lungs or, rarely, to other tissues or organs, such as the liver, bones or brain Cancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer stages . the type of testicular cancer you have – whether it’s a seminoma or a non-seminoma the stage of your testicular cancer For stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose of chemotherapy may be given to help prevent the cancer returning. A short course of radiotherapy is also sometimes recommended. For stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications. For stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver. In non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour. Orchidectomy An orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. If you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading. By removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved. Your sex life and ability to father children won’t be affected. About 1 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. In such circumstances, it’s sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. You should ask your surgeon about this if you’re in this position. An orchidectomy isn’t carried out through the scrotum. It’s done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic . You can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn’t greatly affected. The artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic). It probably won’t be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. It may be slightly different in size or texture. After an orchidectomy, it’s often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. If only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn’t be any lasting side effects. If both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you’ll be infertile. However, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date. You may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to. Sperm banking Some people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops. In people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), the ability to ejaculate (eject sperm from the penis) may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm. HIV , hepatitis B and hepatitis C . If you’re having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 to 4 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. Ask if you’re concerned about your fertility. Cancer Research UK has more information about sperm banking , including the cost of sperm storage. Testosterone replacement therapy If you still have a remaining testicle, in most cases (90%) your body will make enough testosterone so you won’t notice any difference. oily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset of acne breast enlargement and swelling a change in normal urinary patterns, such as needing to urinate more frequently or having problems passing urine (caused by an enlarged prostate gland that puts pressure on your bladder) There are also concerns that testosterone replacement may increase the risk of prostate cancer and you should discuss this with your doctor. However, the risks from having testosterone replacement are usually much lower than the benefits of receiving it. Lymph node and lung surgery More advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of your body’s immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection. Lymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing. In some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. This is known as retrograde ejaculation. If you have retrograde ejaculation, you’ll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won’t be able to father a child. Men and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). There are also a number of newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility. Some people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven’t disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. This type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn’t usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term. Nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection A newer type of lymph node surgery, called nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility. In nerve-sparing RPLND, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. This means there’s less chance of nerve damage occurring. The disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding. Therefore, nerve-sparing RPLND is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND) is a type of ‘keyhole’ surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes. During LRPLND, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions in your abdomen. An instrument called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. An endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor. Small, surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes. The advantage of LRPLND is that there’s less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery time. Also, as with nerve-sparing RPLND, in LRPLND there’s a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to retrograde ejaculation. However, as LRPLND is a new technique, there’s little available evidence regarding the procedure’s long-term safety and effectiveness. If you’re considering LRPLND, you should understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. Sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. It may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer. If testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy. Side effects of radiotherapy can include: reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to sunburn nausea diarrhoea fatigue Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying. You may require chemotherapy if you have advanced testicular cancer or it’s spread within your body. It’s also used to help prevent the cancer returning. Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours. Sometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body’s normal, healthy cells. This is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. The most common include: vomiting hair loss nausea sore mouth and mouth ulcers loss of appetite fatigue breathlessness and lung damage infertility ringing in your ears ( tinnitus ) skin that bleeds or bruises easily low blood counts increased vulnerability to infection numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet kidney damage Bleomycin One of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage and you should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle. However, the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure. Having children contraception , such as a condom , during this time. Condoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy. This is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy . Follow-up Most recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. In seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. Recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people. Because of the risk of recurrence, you’ll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. These include: a physical examination blood tests to check for tumour markers a chest X-ray a computerised tomography (CT) scan Recurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you’ll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you. Cancer Research UK has more information about follow-up for testicular cancer. ",

While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of cancer, these changes should be investigated. Read more about diagnosing vulval cancer . There are 2 types of VIN: usual or undifferentiated VIN – this usually affects women and anyone with a vulva under 50 and is thought to be caused by an HPV infection differentiated VIN (dVIN) – this is a rarer type, usually affecting women and anyone with a vulva over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulva Human papilloma virus (HPV) Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. It’s spread during sex, including anal and oral sex. There are many different types of HPV, and most people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to further problems. However, HPV is present in at least 40% of people with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer . It’s thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is known as VIN. Skin conditions Several skin conditions can affect the vulva. In a small number of cases these are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer. Two of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus and lichen planus . Both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured. If you would prefer to be examined by a female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your GP practice know in advance of your appointment. Referral to a gynaecologist Biopsy A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous. This is often done after a local anaesthetic has been given to numb the area, which means the procedure shouldn’t be painful and you can go home the same day. Occasionally, it may be done under general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital. Your doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from. You may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards. Your doctor will usually see you 7 to 10 days later to discuss the results with you. Further tests If the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is. These may include: a colposcopy – a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina a cystoscopy – an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow tube inserted into the bladder a proctoscopy – an examination of the inside of the rectum biopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva to check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs an X-ray to check that cancer has not spread to your lungs The results of these tests will allow your doctor to ‘stage’ your cancer. This means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread. Staging In most cases, you’ll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation on to the section of the body that contains the cancer. Side effects The medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. Side effects are common and include: tiredness feeling and being sick hair thinning or hair loss sore mouth and mouth ulcers ","Diagnosing vulval cancer The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors: increasing age vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) – where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous persistent infection with certain versions of the human papilloma virus (HPV) skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus smoking You may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection. Read more about the . How vulval cancer is treated Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. The exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition. These include: increasing age vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) human papilloma virus (HPV) infection skin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus smoking Increasing age The risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. Most cases develop in women and anyone with a vulva aged 65 or over. Very occasionally women and anyone with a vulva under 50 can be affected. Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition. This means there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren’t cancerous, but could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. This is a gradual process that usually takes well over 10 years. ",Some people experience feelings of depression ,"About vulval cancer Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women and anyone with a vulva. The vulva is a woman’s external genitals. It includes the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ that helps reach sexual climax), and the Bartholin’s glands (2 small glands each side of the vagina). Most of those affected by vulval cancer are older women and anyone with a vulva over the age of 65. The condition is rare in women and anyone with a vulva under 50 who have not yet gone through the menopause . Some people may also have radiotherapy (where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy (where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you’re not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it isn’t possible to remove it all. Read more about . Can vulval cancer be prevented? It’s not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by: practising safer sex – using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV attending cervical screening appointments – cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN stopping smoking The HPV vaccination may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is offered to all girls who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme. Smoking Smoking increases your risk of developing VIN and vulval cancer. This may be because smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the HPV virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus. Diagnosing vulval cancer Speak to your GP if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or ulcer, or unexplained bleeding. The staging system for vulval cancer is: stage 1 – the cancer is confined to the vulva stage 2 – the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodes Stage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. Stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible. The main options are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy If your cancer is at an early stage, it’s often possible to get rid of it completely. However, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread. Surgery to remove vulval cancer There are 3 surgical options to treat vulval cancer: radical wide local excision – the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least 1cm wide, as a precaution radical partial vulvectomy – a larger section of your vulva is removed, such as 1 or both of the labia and the clitoris radical vulvectomy – the whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoris The time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. For extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months before you start to feel better. Your surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you’re having. Possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex. Assessing and removing groin lymph nodes An additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they’re found to contain cancer. Sentinel node biopsy If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it’s sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as sentinel nodes. Sentinel nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying its flow to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. These are then removed and checked for cancerous cells. Groin lymphadenectomy Removing cancerous lymph nodes reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid (lymphoedema) . Pelvic exenteration If a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). Stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. This is known as a colostomy . If your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. This is known as a urostomy. Alternatively, it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in. Reconstructive surgery If only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva can often be neatly stitched together. Otherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a skin graft, where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or tummy and moved to the wound in your vulva. Another option is to have a skin flap, where an area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and cover the wound. These reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy involves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. There are several ways it can be used to treat vulval cancer: before surgery to try to shrink a large cancer – this is to help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs after surgery to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left – for example, for cases where cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin as an alternative to surgery, if you’re not well enough to have an operation Side effects While radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. This can lead to a number of side effects, such as: sore skin around the vulva area diarrhoea feeling tired all the time loss of pubic hair, which may be permanent swelling of the vulva narrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult inflammation of your bladder (cystitis) In younger people, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger an early menopause . This means they will no longer be able to have any children. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy . Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is where medication is used to kill cancer cells. It’s usually given by injection. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy . Emotional support You may also find it useful to contact one of the main cancer charities, such as: Macmillan Cancer Support – the helpline is available on 0808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm Cancer Research UK – a cancer nurse helpline is available on 0808 800 4040, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm ",
Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/,About vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia ,"Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including: extreme tiredness a lack of energy pins and needles (paraesthesia) a sore and red tongue mouth ulcers muscle weakness disturbed vision psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion problems with memory, understanding and judgement Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don’t have anaemia. Read about the When to see your GP blood test . Read about diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia extreme tiredness (fatigue) lack of energy (lethargy) breathlessness feeling faint headaches pale skin noticeable heartbeats (palpitations) hearing sounds coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source ( tinnitus ) loss of appetite and weight loss a pale yellow tinge to your skin a sore and red tongue (glossitis) mouth ulcers pins and needles (paraesthesia) changes in the way that you walk and move around disturbed vision irritability depression changes in the way you think, feel and behave a decline in your mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgement ( dementia ) reduced sense of taste diarrhoea numbness and tingling in the feet and hands muscle weakness depression When to see your GP Read more about diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Blood tests Different types of blood tests can be carried out to help identify people with a possible vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check: whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) than normal whether your red blood cells are larger than normal the level of vitamin B12 in your blood the level of folate in your blood A particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood. This means it measures forms of vitamin B12 that are “active” and can be used by your body, as well as the “inactive” forms, which can’t. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is “inactive”, a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels, even though your body can’t use much of it. There are some types of blood test that may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren’t yet widely available. Identifying the cause For example, you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you’re unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat. Tests for pernicious anaemia aren’t always conclusive, but they can often give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition. Referral to a specialist a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) – if your GP suspects you don’t have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn’t absorbing it properly a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) – if your GP suspects you have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet A dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet. For injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer. If you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months. Cyanocobalamin injections aren’t routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin. If a vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system. Monitoring your condition Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia As most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare. However, complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you’ve been deficient in either vitamin for some time. Anaemia complications All types of anaemia, regardless of the cause, can lead to heart and lung complications as the heart struggles to pump oxygen to the vital organs. Adults with severe anaemia are at risk of developing: an abnormally fast heart beat (tachycardia) heart failure – where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure Complications of vitamin B12 deficiency A lack of vitamin B12 (with or without anaemia) can cause the following complications: Neurological changes A lack of vitamin B12 can cause neurological problems (issues affecting your nervous system), such as: vision problems memory loss pins and needles (paraesthesia) loss of physical coordination (ataxia), which can affect your whole body and cause difficulty speaking or walking damage to parts of the nervous system ( peripheral neuropathy ), particularly in the legs If neurological problems do develop, they may be irreversible. Infertility ","Diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin. Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia , which occurs when the body doesn’t contain enough iron. There are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including: pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time medication – certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs Both vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74. Read about the Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body’s ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Most people with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are larger than normal. The medical term for this is “megaloblastic anaemia”. A vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below. Pernicious anaemia Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK. Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means your immune system (the body’s natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body’s healthy cells. In your stomach, vitamin B12 is combined with a protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum. The exact cause of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as Addison’s disease or vitiligo. Diet Some people can develop a vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin B12 from their diet. A diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin B12, but people who don’t regularly eat these foods – such as those following a vegan diet or who have a generally very poor diet – can become deficient. Stores of vitamin B12 in the body can last around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for any problems to develop after a dietary change. Conditions affecting the stomach Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of enough vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency. Conditions affecting the intestines Some conditions that affect your intestines can also stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12. For example, Crohn’s disease Medication Some types of medicine can lead to a reduction in the amount of vitamin B12 in your body. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – a medication sometimes used to treat indigestion – can make a vitamin B12 deficiency worse. PPIs inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin B12 from the food you eat. Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin B12 levels and will monitor you if necessary. Functional vitamin B12 deficiency Some people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood. This can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency – where there’s a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in neurological complications involving the spinal cord. Folate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body’s store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin. Like vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below. Diet Good sources of folate include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. If you don’t regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency. Folate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn’t involve eating good sources of folate. Malabsorption Sometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as coeliac disease . Excessive urination You may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as: congestive heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body acute liver damage – often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol long-term dialysis – where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood Medication Some types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb. These include some anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary. Your body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency if you can’t meet your body’s demands for the vitamin. Your body may need more folate than usual if you: are pregnant (see below) have cancer have a blood disorder – such as sickle cell anaemia Premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) are also more likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal. Pregnancy If you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it’s recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you’re 12 weeks pregnant. This will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop. Folic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your GP, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores. If you’re pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body’s need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your GP will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic. In some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. For example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg or 5,000 micrograms) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 0.4 milligrams (0.4mg or 400 micrograms). Read more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy Diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Diet-related If your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year. People who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life. Although it’s less common, people with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and their diet has improved. Good sources of vitamin B12 include: meat salmon and cod milk and other dairy products eggs If you’re a vegetarian and vegan, or are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products. Check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12 different foods contain. Not diet-related If your vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you’ll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life. ",,"Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia About vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Most cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months. In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas. Read about Complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Although it’s uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you’ve been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time. Potential complications can include: problems with the nervous system temporary infertility heart conditions pregnancy complications and birth defects Adults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure. Read about the complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin. Read more about the To treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake. Good sources of folate include: broccoli Brussels sprouts asparagus peas chickpeas brown rice Most people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer – possibly for life. blood tests . Stomach cancer If you have a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anaemia (a condition where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach), your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased. Neural tube defects If you’re pregnant, not having enough vitamin B12 can increase the risk of your baby developing a serious birth defect known as a neural tube defect. The neural tube is a narrow channel that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord. Examples of neural tube defects include: spina bifida – where the baby’s spine doesn’t develop properly anencephaly – where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull encephalocele – where a membrane or skin-covered sac containing part of the brain pushes out of a hole in the skull Complications of folate deficiency A lack of folate (with or without anaemia) can also cause complications, some of which are outlined below. Infertility As with a lack of vitamin B12, a folate deficiency can also affect your fertility. However, this is only temporary and can usually be reversed with folate supplements. Cardiovascular disease Research has shown a lack of folate in your body may increase your risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) . CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) . Cancer Research has shown that folate deficiency can increase your risk of some cancers, such as colon cancer . Problems in childbirth A lack of folate during pregnancy may increase the risk of the baby being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or having a low birthweight. The risk of placental abruption may also be increased. This is a serious condition where the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall, causing tummy (abdominal) pain and bleeding from the vagina. Neural tube defects As with a vitamin B12 deficiency, a lack of folate can also affect an unborn baby’s growth and development in the womb (uterus). This increases the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida developing in the unborn baby. ",
Thyroid cancer: Teenagers and young adults,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-teenagers-and-young-adults/thyroid-cancer-teenagers-and-young-adults/,Introduction The thyroid and types of thyroid cancer Having tests for thyroid cancer ,"The first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger. a hoarse voice that doesn’t get better difficulty swallowing or breathing tests to find out more. The thyroid and types of thyroid cancer The thyroid is a small gland in the front of the neck just below the voice box (larynx). It is made up of 2 parts, or lobes, 1 on each side of the neck. It’s part of a network of glands throughout the body that make up the endocrine system. This system is responsible for producing the body’s hormones that help to control and influence various body functions. The thyroid produces 2 hormones: thyroid hormone that controls your metabolism calcitonin that helps to control the calcium levels in your body Types of thyroid cancer There are 4 main types of thyroid cancer: papillary is the most common type of thyroid cancer – it’s usually slow-growing follicular is the second most common type – it’s also usually slow-growing medullary is a rare type of thyroid cancer which sometimes runs in families anaplastic is another rare type of thyroid cancer, which is more common in older people Young people are mostly affected by the papillary and follicular types. Rarely other types of cancer occur in the thyroid gland such as lymphoma, or other cancers that have spread from another part of the body. This section is for teens and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer. If you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our thyroid cancer section. Having tests for thyroid cancer This information is for teenagers and young adults who may be having tests to find out if they have thyroid cancer. If you think you might have some of the Visiting your GP At the hospital You’ll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. They work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them. They may include: a doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist) a surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery a pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases a cancer specialist (oncologist) an X-ray specialist (radiologist) a clinical nurse specialist Your doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a biopsy. An FNA involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope. A biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. You might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. You may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. There is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section. If the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. Macmillan Cancer Support has information on these tests. These tests may include: a chest X-ray to check your lungs a CT , MRI or PET scan a radioisotope scan You won’t necessarily need all of these tests. It will depend on the results of the first ones. Having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help. If you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our general thyroid cancer information. ","Genes Genes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.

Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are the most common types of thyroid cancer in young adults. If you’d like to find out about a different type of thyroid cancer you could talk to Macmillan Cancer Support . It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured. If you’re worried about thyroid cancer Surgery Lymph nodes In the neck, close to the thyroid, there are lymph nodes. These are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. Sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. They may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there. After the operation You will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. There will be a scar on your neck – usually just above the collarbone. Sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. You may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone. You may feel really shocked and scared by the thought of having this operation. But it does give a really good chance of a cure. Your specialist will talk things over with you in detail and make sure that you fully understand what’s involved. If you want to know more about what happens when you go in for an operation, there’s lots more information in the general surgery section. Radioactive iodine Your doctors and nurses will also explain things to you and give you support. How does it work? There’s a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. Normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too. Radioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. Any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. This helps to destroy them. Radioactive iodine doesn’t usually affect other parts of the body because other cells don’t take up iodine the way thyroid cells do. How is it given? You may have radioactive iodine as a capsule, as a drink or as an injection into a vein in your arm through a cannula. be given an injection of a drug called thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen ® ) Once your radiation levels are safe, you’ll be allowed home. You’ll also be able to start eating your usual foods again. Check with the staff about what you can and can’t do when you get home. There are likely to be some precautions to take for up to a few weeks. External beam radiotherapy If you’ve had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can’t produce thyroid hormones anymore. Without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy. What can help? As well as replacing the hormones you’re missing, thyroxine can also help stop papillary or follicular thyroid cancer coming back. So if you have only had part of your thyroid gland removed you may still need to take thyroid hormone tablets. Blood tests You’ll need to have your blood checked regularly to monitor the hormone levels. It can sometimes take months to find the right dose of thyroxine for you. But once the right dose is found, there shouldn’t be any side effects, because they are simply replacing normal thyroid hormones. It’s important to remember to take your tablets every day. It can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine. Macmillan Cancer Support has more general information about radiotherapy , surgery and . This information is written for people of all ages, not just young adults with thyroid cancer.

Wilms’ tumour,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-children/wilms-tumour/,Wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer in children. It most often affects children under the age of 5. ,"The most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite. How Wilms’ tumour is diagnosed A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms’ tumour. An abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an MRI and/or CT scan of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child’s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a biopsy ","In 1 in 100 people with Wilms’ tumour, another family member will also have Wilms’ tumour. Late side effects A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. Infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare. ","Staging Apart from very young children (under 6 months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. The operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy). Radiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. This will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. Radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body. ","It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. Wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It’s thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child’s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms’ tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found. The kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. They clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine. In the case of a Wilms’ tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. As most Wilms’ tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child’s tumour straight away. An exception is that babies under 6 months old usually have surgery straight away. Stage 1 The tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. It can be completely removed with surgery. Stage 2 The tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it’s still possible to remove it completely with surgery. Stage 3 The tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery. Stage 4 The tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. Tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases. Stage 5 There are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral Wilms’ tumour). Surgery Two types of Wilms’ tumour – anaplastic and blastemal – are considered to be ‘higher risk’ than other Wilms’ tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy. Anaplastic Wilms’ tumour About 5% to 10% of Wilms’ tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope. Blastemal Wilms’ tumour This group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. These cells are known as blastemal cells. Tumours, where most of these cells survive chemotherapy, are called blastemal tumours. Other kidney tumours Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. What doctors find out about the tumour after surgery – for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread – helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). This is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). This chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Clinical trials Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. Follow-up care Most children with Wilms’ tumour are cured. If the cancer comes back, it’s usually within the first 2 years. When one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney. Your feelings As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child. ",
Whooping cough,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/whooping-cough/,"Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. ","cold , such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature. Intense coughing bouts start about a week later. The bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night. Coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting. Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath – this may cause a ‘whoop’ sound, although not everyone has this. The strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes. Young children can sometimes briefly turn blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing – this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should start again quickly. In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing. The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely. Who’s at risk of whooping cough Whooping cough can affect people of any age, including: babies and young children – young babies under 6 months of age are at a particularly increased risk of complications of whooping cough older children and adults – it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and frustrating people who’ve had whooping cough before – you’re not immune to whooping cough if you’ve had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child – protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years You can get whooping cough if you come into close contact with someone with the infection. have had a cough for more than 3 weeks have a cough that is particularly severe or is getting worse People diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of infection may be prescribed antibiotics ",Whooping cough is spread in the droplets of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection. ,,"When to get medical advice Phone 999 or go to A&E if: You or your child: have significant breathing difficulties, such as long periods of breathlessness or choking, shallow breathing, periods where breathing stops, or dusky, blue skin develop signs of serious complications of whooping cough, such as fits (seizures) or pneumonia Speak to your GP practice or phone 111 if: You or your child: While you’re recovering at home, it can help to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, clean away mucus and sick from your or your child’s mouth, and take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for a fever. Avoid using cough medicines, as they’re not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help. Stopping the infection spreading If you or your child are taking antibiotics for whooping cough, you need to be careful not to spread the infection to others. Do cover your or your child’s mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing dispose of used tissues immediately wash your and your child’s hands regularly with soap and water Other members of your household may also be given antibiotics and a dose of the whooping cough vaccine to stop them becoming infected. Vaccinations for whooping cough There are 3 routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough: the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy – this can protect your baby during the first few weeks of life; the best time to have it is soon after the 16th week of your pregnancy the 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age the 4-in-1 pre-school booster – offered to children by 3 years and 4 months These vaccines don’t offer lifelong protection from whooping cough, but they can help stop children getting it when they’re young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection. Older children and adults aren’t routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak. Complications of whooping cough Babies and young children under 6 months are usually most severely affected by whooping cough. They’re at an increased risk of: dehydration breathing difficulties weight loss pneumonia – an infection of the lungs fits (seizures) kidney problems brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen reaching the brain death – although this is very rare Older children and adults tend to be less severely affected, although they may experience problems caused by repeated coughing, such as nosebleeds , bruised ribs or a hernia.

Womb (uterus) cancer,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-types-in-adults/womb-uterus-cancer/,About womb cancer ,"Read more about the and diagnosing womb cancer Types of womb cancer The vast majority of womb cancers begin in the cells that make up the lining of the womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb is often called endometrial cancer. In rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer. This article uses the term womb cancer, and mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. Read more information about soft tissue sarcomas . Womb cancer is separate from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as ovarian cancer and cervical cancer . Why does womb cancer happen? Read more about The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer. Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause , so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual. In women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of: periods that are heavier than usual vaginal bleeding in between normal periods pain in the back, legs, or pelvis loss of appetite tiredness nausea When to seek medical advice If you have postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP. endometriosis – where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb fibroids – non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus polyps in the womb lining Other types of gynaecological cancer can also cause unusual vaginal bleeding, particularly cervical cancer .

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) Another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of ultrasound scan that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe. This is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. The TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells. Biopsy If the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a biopsy Read further information: Cancer Research UK: Cancer Research UK: Read further information: Cancer Research UK: having your operation for womb cancer National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer Radiotherapy A course of radiotherapy Chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You’ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital. Radiotherapy for endometrial cancer can make your vagina narrower and less flexible. Sometimes the vagina gets so narrow that having sex becomes difficult. To stop this happening, you should be offered a set of vaginal dilators, which are plastic cones you put into your vagina to stretch it. You can also stretch your vagina by having sex, or by using your fingers or a vibrator.

Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body. A number of things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) . There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. It’s not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception . Read more about the How is womb cancer treated? Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system. Increased risk A number of things have been identified that increase the risk of developing womb cancer. Age The risk of developing womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases occur in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74. Oestrogen The risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body’s exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system. progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries The levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn’t kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen. After the menopause Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Because of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and womb cancer, oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should only be given to those who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy). In all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer. Being overweight or obese As oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer. Women and anyone with a womb who is overweight is 3 times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with those who are a healthy weight. One way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand your healthy body mass index (BMI) . Reproductive history Women and anyone with a womb who has not had children are at a higher risk of womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during pregnancy have a protective effect on the lining of the womb. Tamoxifen Many women and anyone with ovaries with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Women and anyone with ovaries with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies. Macmillan: Diagnosing womb cancer You should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure. ","In a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells. The biopsy can be carried out in several ways, including: aspiration biopsy – a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells hysteroscopy – this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it In some cases, a hysteroscopy may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&C). D&C is a minor surgical procedure carried out under general anaesthetic , where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing. Blood test A blood test can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test. However, this type of test isn’t very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn’t mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don’t have these chemicals in their blood.

It’s also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer. Abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer. If you have been through the menopause , any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods. You should speak to your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure. A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery. A type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children. Living with womb cancer Living with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways. For example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive. You may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer. Read more about living with womb cancer Who is affected? Womb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It’s the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in women after breast cancer , lung cancer , and cancer of the colon and rectum . Womb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. Most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74. breast cancer ) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer. It’s important to visit your GP if you’re taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding. Diabetes Women and anyone with a womb with diabetes are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as those without the condition. These tests may include: a chest X-ray – where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – where magnetic fields are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread further blood tests – these are usually done to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning for more information about staging. Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus) stage 2 – the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix) stage 3 – the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs Your chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it’s diagnosed. Read further information: Cancer Research UK: stages of womb cancer Cancer Research UK: statistics and outlook for womb cancer Having a hysterectomy means you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven’t already reached the menopause may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children. In this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy. Even if there’s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Surgery Surgery for stage 1 womb cancer If you have stage 1 cancer, you’ll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as the uterus (hysterectomy). The surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread. The most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it. It’s sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments can be used. This means the surgeon can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring. You’ll probably be ready to go home 3 to 5 days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully. After your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You’ll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications. When you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you. Surgery for stage 2 or 3 womb cancer If you have stage 2 or 3 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy. Surgery for advanced cancer (stage 4) If you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery. There are 2 types of radiotherapy used to treat womb cancer: external radiotherapy – where a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis Some women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina. Radiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and diarrhoea . Chemotherapy If you have stage 3 or 4 womb cancer, you may be given a course of chemotherapy Side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting hair loss fatigue There is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream (sepsis) , as your body’s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.

This can be a major operation, and recovery may take from 6 to 12 weeks. During this time you will have to avoid lifting things (for example, children and heavy shopping bags) and doing heavy housework. You won’t be able to drive for between 3 and 8 weeks after the operation. Most people need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. The recovery time will depend on the type of surgery you have, whether or not any problems develop, and what type of work you will return to. Follow-up Read further information: Macmillan: Relationships and sex Relationships with friends and family Knowing how to talk to your friends and family about your cancer can be difficult, and they may find it hard to talk to you, too. People deal with serious problems in different ways. It’s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while having to cope with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you feel you have problems with sex that aren’t getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or a sex therapist. Read further information: Macmillan: Talk to others Being diagnosed with cancer can be hard, both for patients and their families. You’ll need to deal with the emotional and practical difficulties. With womb cancer, you have to cope physically with recovering from a hysterectomy, as well as the possible emotional impact of losing your womb. Younger women may have to face the fact they won’t be able to have children and all the grief and anger that may cause. Often, it can help to discuss your feelings and other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support: your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor if you’re struggling with feelings of depression, talk to your GP – a course of antidepressant drugs may be helpful, or your GP can arrange for you to get help from a counsellor or psychotherapist Read further information: Cancer Research UK: coping with cancer Money and financial support If you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or you have a low household income Find out what help is available to you early on.

Walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart. The National Eczema Society also recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees. Emollients To apply the emollient: use a large amount – you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas don’t rub it in – instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows apply every 2 to 3 hours for very dry skin after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist do not share emollients with other people It is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture. Apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up. Side effects It’s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). If you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your GP, who can prescribe an alternative product. Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath. Topical corticosteroids If your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. They are also commonly known as topical steroids. Different strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. If you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid. How to use topical corticosteroids Side effects Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream. Generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it. Compression stockings Medical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. They are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart. Medical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins. Choice of compression stockings Compression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. They are also available in: different colours different lengths – some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema) different foot styles – some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toes Support stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. Compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first. In some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead. Wearing compression stockings You will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. Wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them. Pull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly. Take care when putting compression stockings on and taking them off, as this can damage fragile skin. If you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings. Caring for compression stockings Compression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3 to 6 months. Speak to your GP if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective. You should be prescribed 2 stockings (or 2 sets of stockings if you are wearing 1 on each leg) so that 1 stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat. endothermal ablation – where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used to seal the affected veins sclerotherapy – where a special foam is injected into your veins to seal them ligation and stripping – where affected veins are tied off and surgically removed These procedures are usually performed in the day surgery department of a hospital. Read more about ","Diagnosing varicose eczema Varicose eczema is caused by increased pressure in the leg veins. When the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it’s difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it can leak backwards. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren’t working properly. Read more about the . How varicose eczema is treated Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins. Inside your veins there are valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards. Sometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. If the valves do not function properly, blood may leak backwards. This increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin. This increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged ( varicose veins ). Who’s most at risk? It is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken. Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are certain factors that increase the chances of this happening, including: gender – varicose eczema is more common in women obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation in your leg veins having previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – blood clots that develop in leg veins, which can damage the valves in your veins increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation Diagnosing varicose eczema ",varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs leg ulcers – areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue surgery or injury to your legs Your GP may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you.

A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use. Referral to a specialist You may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. This might be a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if: you have varicose veins and changes to your skin, such as varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis (hard, tightened skin) or a history of leg ulcers you have very poor blood flow in the blood vessels in your legs emollients (moisturisers) topical corticosteroids compression stockings Lipodermatosclerosis (hardened, tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema.

Some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your GP to recommend a suitable product. You may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. You may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that they contain. Ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. How to use emollients Most people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. When applying the medication, you should: apply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin) apply it only to the affected area If your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them. If you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. Your GP will advise you on how often you should be applying them.

Yellow fever,https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/yellow-fever/,"Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is spread by certain types of mosquito. It’s mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and parts of the Caribbean. The condition can be prevented with a vaccination and is a very rare cause of illness in travellers. Between 1999 and 2018, there were 12 cases of yellow fever reported among European travellers. None of these travellers were vaccinated, 5 of these cases occurred in 2018. If you’re planning to visit places where yellow fever infection is found, you should seek travel health advice before you travel. A map and list of countries where yellow fever is found is available on the NHS Fit for Travel website. How yellow fever is spread ","a high temperature (fever) a headache nausea or vomiting muscle pain, including backache loss of appetite This stage will usually pass after 3 to 4 days and most people will make a full recovery. However, around 15% of people go on to develop more serious problems, including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach (causing blood in your vomit and stools). When to seek medical advice blood test You will be admitted to hospital for assessment and supportive care. Yellow fever vaccination The yellow fever vaccine protects you from infection when you travel to a country where yellow fever virus occurs and prevents the disease from spreading between countries. After you have received the vaccine you are given a yellow fever vaccine certificate to prove that you have received the vaccine and are protected from infection. This certificate is designed to fit inside your passport and is valid for life. The countries that require proof of vaccination are those where either the disease occurs, or where it could occur because they have the correct mosquito and monkey species that could harbour the infection. More about the yellow fever vaccine Find your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre Information about you If you have yellow fever, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register .
